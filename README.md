# The Illustrated Primer

This was our team's submission for the GNEC 2024 Hackathon. It is designed to work along with one of our other projects, [DiplomaLink](https://github.com/81reap/diplomalink). The idea is to leverage generative AI to be able to create high quality content in multiple languages and mediums to increase the access of high-quality education across the globe.
