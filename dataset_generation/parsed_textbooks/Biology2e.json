Scientists believe that the first forms of life on Earth were microorganisms that existed for billions\nof years in the ocean before plants and animals appeared. The mammals, birds, and flowers so familiar\nto us are all relatively recent, originating 130 to 250 million years ago. The earliest representatives of the\ngenus Homo, to which we belong, have inhabited this planet for only the last 2.5 million years, and only\nin the last 300,000 years have humans started looking like we do today.\nChapter Outline\n1.1 The Science of\nBiology\n1.2 Themes and\nConcepts of Biology\nFigure 1.2 Formerly called blue-green algae, these (a) cyanobacteria, magnified 300x under a light microscope, are\nsome of Earth\u2019s oldest life forms.

This is a very broad definition because the\nscope of biology is vast. Biologists may study anything from the microscopic or submicroscopic view of a cell\nto ecosystems and the whole living planet (Figure 1.2). Listening to the daily news, you will quickly realize\nhow many aspects of biology we discuss every day. For example, recent news topics include Escherichia coli\n(Figure 1.3) outbreaks in spinach and Salmonella contamination in peanut butter. Other subjects include\nefforts toward finding a cure for AIDS, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and cancer. On a global scale, many researchers\nare committed to finding ways to protect the planet, solve environmental issues, and reduce the effects of\nclimate change. All of these diverse endeavors are related to different facets of the discipline of biology.\nFigure 1.3 Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, in this scanning electron micrograph, are normal residents of our\ndigestive tracts that aid in absorbing vitamin K and other nutrients. However, virulent strains are sometimes\nresponsible for disease outbreaks.

What does the study of biology share with other scientific\ndisciplines? We can define science (from the Latin scientia, meaning \u201cknowledge\u201d) as knowledge that covers\ngeneral truths or the operation of general laws, especially when acquired and tested by the scientific\nmethod. It becomes clear from this definition that applying scientific method plays a major role in science.\nThe scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful\nobservation.\n8\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nWe will examine scientific method steps in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of\nhypotheses by means of repeatable experiments. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event, which one can test.\nAlthough using the scientific method is inherent to science, it is inadequate in determining what science is. This is because it is\nrelatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines such as physics and chemistry, but when it comes to disciplines like\narchaeology, psychology, and geology, the scientific method becomes less applicable as repeating experiments becomes more\ndifficult.\nThese areas of study are still sciences, however. Consider archaeology\u2014even though one cannot perform repeatable\nexperiments, hypotheses may still be supported. For instance, an archaeologist can hypothesize that an ancient culture existed\nbased on finding a piece of pottery. He or she could make further hypotheses about various characteristics of this culture, which\ncould be correct or false through continued support or contradictions from other findings. A hypothesis may become a verified\ntheory. A theory is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena. Therefore, we may be better off to define\nscience as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe.\nNatural Sciences\nWhat would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons? Exhibits about how the brain\nfunctions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Maybe all of the above? Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy,\nbiology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (Figure 1.4). However, scientists consider those\nfields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes natural sciences. Thus, a museum of natural\nsciences might contain any of the items listed above.\nFigure 1.4 The diversity of scientific fields includes astronomy, biology, computer science, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, mathematics,\nand many other fields. (credit: \u201cImage Editor\u201d/Flickr)\nThere is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences include, however. For some experts, the\nnatural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences\ninto life sciences, which study living things and include biology, and physical sciences, which study nonliving matter and\ninclude astronomy, geology, physics, and chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life\nand physical sciences and are interdisciplinary. Some refer to natural sciences as \u201chard science\u201d because they rely on the use of\n1.1 \u2022 The Science of Biology\n9\nquantitative data. Social sciences that study society and human behavior are more likely to use qualitative assessments to drive\ninvestigations and findings.\nNot surprisingly, the natural science of biology has many branches or subdisciplines. Cell biologists study cell structure and\nfunction, while biologists who study anatomy investigate the structure of an entire organism. Those biologists studying\nphysiology, however, focus on the internal functioning of an organism. Some areas of biology focus on only particular types of\nliving things. For example, botanists explore plants, while zoologists specialize in animals.\nScientific Reasoning\nOne thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal \u201cto know.\u201d Curiosity and inquiry are the driving forces for the\ndevelopment of science. Scientists seek to understand the world and the way it operates. To do this, they use two methods of\nlogical thinking: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.\nInductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion. This type of\nreasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and records them. These data\ncan be qualitative or quantitative, and one can supplement the raw data with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many\nobservations, the scientist can infer conclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating\ngeneralizations inferred from careful observation and analyzing a large amount of data. Brain studies provide an example. In\nthis type of research, scientists observe many live brains while people are engaged in a specific activity, such as viewing images\nof food. The scientist then predicts the part of the brain that \u201clights up\u201d during this activity to be the part controlling the\nresponse to the selected stimulus, in this case, images of food. Excess absorption of radioactive sugar derivatives by active areas\nof the brain causes the various areas to \"light up\". Scientists use a scanner to observe the resultant increase in radioactivity.\nThen, researchers can stimulate that part of the brain to see if similar responses result.\nDeductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reason, the pattern of\nthinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking\nthat uses a general principle or law to forecast specific results. From those general principles, a scientist can extrapolate and\npredict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. Studies in climate change can illustrate\nthis type of reasoning. For example, scientists may predict that if the climate becomes warmer in a particular region, then the\ndistribution of plants and animals should change.\nBoth types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and hypothesis-based\nscience. Descriptive (or discovery) science, which is usually inductive, aims to observe, explore, and discover, while hypothesis-\nbased science, which is usually deductive, begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that one\ncan test. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, and most scientific endeavors combine both\napproaches. The fuzzy boundary becomes apparent when thinking about how easily observation can lead to specific questions.\nFor example, a gentleman in the 1940s observed that the burr seeds that stuck to his clothes and his dog\u2019s fur had a tiny hook\nstructure. On closer inspection, he discovered that the burrs\u2019 gripping device was more reliable than a zipper. He eventually\nexperimented to find the best material that acted similar, and produced the hook-and-loop fastener popularly known today as\nVelcro. Descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue.\nThe Scientific Method\nBiologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses. Known as scientific method,\nthis approach is common to other sciences as well. The scientific method was used even in ancient times, but England\u2019s Sir\nFrancis Bacon (1561\u20131626) first documented it (Figure 1.5). He set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry. The scientific\nmethod is not used only by biologists; researchers from almost all fields of study can apply it as a logical, rational problem-\nsolving method.\n10\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 1.5 Historians credit Sir Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626) as the first to define the scientific method. (credit: Paul van Somer)\nThe scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to solve) that leads to a question. Let\u2019s think about a\nsimple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem. One Monday morning, a\nstudent arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That is an observation that also describes a\nproblem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: \u201cWhy is the classroom so warm?\u201d\nProposing a Hypothesis\nRecall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that one can test. To solve a problem, one can propose several hypotheses. For\nexample, one hypothesis might be, \u201cThe classroom is warm because no one turned on the air conditioning.\u201d However, there\ncould be other responses to the question, and therefore one may propose other hypotheses. A second hypothesis might be, \u201cThe\nclassroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nOnce one has selected a hypothesis, the student can make a prediction. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it typically has\nthe format \u201cIf . . . then . . . .\u201d For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, \u201cIf the student turns on the air\nconditioning, then the classroom will no longer be too warm.\u201d\nTesting a Hypothesis\nA valid hypothesis must be testable. It should also be falsifiable, meaning that experimental results can disprove it. Importantly,\nscience does not claim to \u201cprove\u201d anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further\ninformation. This step\u2014openness to disproving ideas\u2014is what distinguishes sciences from non-sciences. The presence of the\nsupernatural, for instance, is neither testable nor falsifiable. To test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one or more\nexperiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or\nmore controls. A variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment. The control group\ncontains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that the researcher hypothesizes.\nTherefore, if the experimental group's results differ from the control group, the difference must be due to the hypothesized\nmanipulation, rather than some outside factor. Look for the variables and controls in the examples that follow. To test the first\nhypothesis, the student would find out if the air conditioning is on. If the air conditioning is turned on but does not work, there\nshould be another reason, and the student should reject this hypothesis. To test the second hypothesis, the student could check\nif the lights in the classroom are functional. If so, there is no power failure and the student should reject this hypothesis. The\nstudents should test each hypothesis by carrying out appropriate experiments. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not\ndetermine whether or not one can accept the other hypotheses. It simply eliminates one hypothesis that is not valid (Figure 1.6).\nUsing the scientific method, the student rejects the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data.\nWhile this \u201cwarm classroom\u201d example is based on observational results, other hypotheses and experiments might have clearer\ncontrols. For instance, a student might attend class on Monday and realize she had difficulty concentrating on the lecture. One\n1.1 \u2022 The Science of Biology\n11\nobservation to explain this occurrence might be, \u201cWhen I eat breakfast before class, I am better able to pay attention.\u201d The\nstudent could then design an experiment with a control to test this hypothesis.\nIn hypothesis-based science, researchers predict specific results from a general premise. We call this type of reasoning\ndeductive reasoning: deduction proceeds from the general to the particular. However, the reverse of the process is also possible:\nsometimes, scientists reach a general conclusion from a number of specific observations. We call this type of reasoning\ninductive reasoning, and it proceeds from the particular to the general. Researchers often use inductive and deductive\nreasoning in tandem to advance scientific knowledge (Figure 1.7).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 1.6 The scientific method consists of a series of well-defined steps. If a hypothesis is not supported by experimental data, one can\npropose a new hypothesis.\nIn the example below, the scientific method is used to solve an everyday problem. Match the scientific method steps (numbered\nitems) with the process of solving the everyday problem (lettered items). Based on the results of the experiment, is the\nhypothesis correct? If it is incorrect, propose some alternative hypotheses.\n1. Observation\na. There is something wrong with the electrical outlet.\n2. Question\nb. If something is wrong with the outlet, my coffeemaker also won\u2019t work when plugged into it.\n12\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n3. Hypothesis (answer)\nc.

Why doesn\u2019t my toaster work?\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 1.7 Scientists use two types of reasoning, inductive and deductive reasoning, to advance scientific knowledge. As is the case in this\nexample, the conclusion from inductive reasoning can often become the premise for deductive reasoning.\nDecide if each of the following is an example of inductive or deductive reasoning.\n1.\nAll flying birds and insects have wings. Birds and insects flap their wings as they move through the air. Therefore, wings\nenable flight.\n2.\nInsects generally survive mild winters better than harsh ones. Therefore, insect pests will become more problematic if\nglobal temperatures increase.\n3.\nChromosomes, the carriers of DNA, are distributed evenly between the daughter cells during cell division. Therefore, each\ndaughter cell will have the same chromosome set as the mother cell.\n4.\nAnimals as diverse as humans, insects, and wolves all exhibit social behavior. Therefore, social behavior must have an\nevolutionary advantage.\nThe scientific method may seem too rigid and structured. It is important to keep in mind that, although scientists often follow\nthis sequence, there is flexibility. Sometimes an experiment leads to conclusions that favor a change in approach. Often, an\n1.1 \u2022 The Science of Biology\n13\nexperiment brings entirely new scientific questions to the puzzle. Many times, science does not operate in a linear fashion.\nInstead, scientists continually draw inferences and make generalizations, finding patterns as their research proceeds. Scientific\nreasoning is more complex than the scientific method alone suggests. Notice, too, that we can apply the scientific method to\nsolving problems that aren\u2019t necessarily scientific in nature.\nTwo Types of Science: Basic Science and Applied Science\nThe scientific community has been debating for the last few decades about the value of different types of science. Is it valuable to\npursue science for the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have worth if we can apply it to\nsolving a specific problem or to bettering our lives? This question focuses on the differences between two types of science: basic\nscience and applied science.\nBasic science or \u201cpure\u201d science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that knowledge. It is not\nfocused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The immediate goal of basic science is\nknowledge for knowledge\u2019s sake, although this does not mean that, in the end, it may not result in a practical application.\nIn contrast, applied science or \u201ctechnology,\u201d aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible, for example, to\nimprove a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster (Figure 1.8). In applied\nscience, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.\nFigure 1.8 After Hurricane Irma struck the Caribbean and Florida in 2017, thousands of baby squirrels like this one were thrown from their\nnests. Thanks to applied science, scientists knew how to rehabilitate the squirrel. (credit: audreyjm529, Flickr)\nSome individuals may perceive applied science as \u201cuseful\u201d and basic science as \u201cuseless.\u201d A question these people might pose to a\nscientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, \u201cWhat for?\u201d However, a careful look at the history of science reveals that\nbasic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. Many scientists think that a basic understanding\nof science is necessary before researchers develop an application therefore, applied science relies on the results that researchers\ngenerate through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move on from basic science in order to find solutions to\nactual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that there are problems that demand immediate attention; however,\nscientists would find few solutions without the help of the wide knowledge foundation that basic science generates.\nOne example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the discovery of DNA\nstructure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication. DNA strands, unique in every\nhuman, are in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life. When DNA replicates, it produces new copies of\nitself, shortly before a cell divides. Understanding DNA replication mechanisms enabled scientists to develop laboratory\ntechniques that researchers now use to identify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine\npaternity. Without basic science, it is unlikely that applied science would exist.\nAnother example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project, a study in which researchers\nanalyzed and mapped each human chromosome to determine the precise sequence of DNA subunits and each gene's exact\nlocation. (The gene is the basic unit of heredity represented by a specific DNA segment that codes for a functional molecule. An\n14\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nindividual\u2019s complete collection of genes is his or her genome.) Researchers have studied other less complex organisms as part of\nthis project in order to gain a better understanding of human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (Figure 1.9) relied on\nbasic research with simple organisms and, later, with the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using the\ndata for applied research, seeking cures and early diagnoses for genetically related diseases.\nFigure 1.9 The Human Genome Project was a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several different science fields.\nResearchers completed the project, which sequenced the entire human genome, in 2003. (credit: the U.S. Department of Energy Genome\nPrograms (http://genomics.energy.gov (http://openstax.org/l/genomics_gov) )\nWhile scientists usually carefully plan research efforts in both basic science and applied science, note that some discoveries are\nmade by serendipity, that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise. Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming\ndiscovered penicillin when he accidentally left a petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria open. An unwanted mold grew on the dish,\nkilling the bacteria. Fleming's curiosity to investigate the reason behind the bacterial death, followed by his experiments, led to\nthe discovery of the antibiotic penicillin, which is produced by the fungus Penicillium. Even in the highly organized world of\nscience, luck\u2014when combined with an observant, curious mind\u2014can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.\nReporting Scientific Work\nWhether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings in order for other researchers\nto expand and build upon their discoveries. Collaboration with other scientists\u2014when planning, conducting, and analyzing\nresults\u2014are all important for scientific research. For this reason, important aspects of a scientist\u2019s work are communicating\nwith peers and disseminating results to peers. Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or\nconference, but this approach can reach only the select few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their results in\npeer-reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals. Peer-reviewed manuscripts are scientific papers that a\nscientist\u2019s colleagues or peers review. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who\njudge whether or not the scientist\u2019s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research\nin a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for\nresearch funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their work so other scientists can reproduce their\nexperiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings. The experimental results must be consistent with\nthe findings of other scientists.\nA scientific paper is very different from creative writing. Although creativity is required to design experiments, there are fixed\nguidelines when it comes to presenting scientific results. First, scientific writing must be brief, concise, and accurate. A\nscientific paper needs to be succinct but detailed enough to allow peers to reproduce the experiments.\nThe scientific paper consists of several specific sections\u2014introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion. This\nstructure is sometimes called the \u201cIMRaD\u201d format. There are usually acknowledgment and reference sections as well as an\nabstract (a concise summary) at the beginning of the paper. There might be additional sections depending on the type of paper\n1.1 \u2022 The Science of Biology\n15\nand the journal where it will be published. For example, some review papers require an outline.\nThe introduction starts with brief, but broad, background information about what is known in the field. A good introduction\nalso gives the rationale of the work. It justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end of the paper, where the\nresearcher will present the hypothesis or research question driving the research. The introduction refers to the published\nscientific work of others and therefore requires citations following the style of the journal. Using the work or ideas of others\nwithout proper citation is plagiarism.\nThe materials and methods section includes a complete and accurate description of the substances the researchers use, and the\nmethod and techniques they use to gather data. The description should be thorough enough to allow another researcher to\nrepeat the experiment and obtain similar results, but it does not have to be verbose. This section will also include information on\nhow the researchers made measurements and the types of calculations and statistical analyses they used to examine raw data.\nAlthough the materials and methods section gives an accurate description of the experiments, it does not discuss them.\nSome journals require a results section followed by a discussion section, but it is more common to combine both. If the journal\ndoes not allow combining both sections, the results section simply narrates the findings without any further interpretation. The\nresearchers present results with tables or graphs, but they do not present duplicate information. In the discussion section, the\nresearchers will interpret the results, describe how variables may be related, and attempt to explain the observations. It is\nindispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously published scientific\nresearch. Therefore, researchers include proper citations in this section as well.\nFinally, the conclusion section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings. While the scientific paper almost\ncertainly answers one or more scientific questions that the researchers stated, any good research should lead to more questions.\nTherefore, a well-done scientific paper allows the researchers and others to continue and expand on the findings.\nReview articles do not follow the IMRAD format because they do not present original scientific findings, or primary literature.\nInstead, they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature and typically include extensive\nreference sections.\n1.2 Themes and Concepts of Biology\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nIdentify and describe the properties of life\n\u2022\nDescribe the levels of organization among living things\n\u2022\nRecognize and interpret a phylogenetic tree\n\u2022\nList examples of different subdisciplines in biology\nBiology is the science that studies life, but what exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question with an obvious response, but\nit is not always easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the\ncharacteristics of living entities but lack others. Although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even\nreproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life. Consequently, virologists are not biologists, strictly\nspeaking. Similarly, some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise to life. Since the events that preceded life\nare not biological events, these scientists are also excluded from biology in the strict sense of the term.\nFrom its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with three questions: What are the shared properties that make something\n\u201calive\u201d? Once we know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure? Finally, when faced\nwith the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand\nthem? As scientists discover new organisms every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.\nProperties of Life\nAll living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to the environment,\nreproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation/homeostasis, energy processing, and evolution. When viewed\ntogether, these eight characteristics serve to define life.\n16\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nOrder\nFigure 1.10 A toad represents a highly organized structure consisting of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. (credit:\n\u201cIvengo\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nOrganisms are highly organized, coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple, single-celled\norganisms are remarkably complex: inside each cell, atoms comprise molecules. These in turn comprise cell organelles and other\ncellular inclusions. In multicellular organisms (Figure 1.10), similar cells form tissues. Tissues, in turn, collaborate to create\norgans (body structures with a distinct function). Organs work together to form organ systems.\nSensitivity or Response to Stimuli\nFigure 1.11 The leaves of this sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched. After a few minutes, the plant\nreturns to normal. (credit: Alex Lomas)\nOrganisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light, climb on fences and walls, or\nrespond to touch (Figure 1.11). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a process called chemotaxis) or light\n(phototaxis). Movement toward a stimulus is a positive response, while movement away from a stimulus is a negative response.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/movement_plants) to see how plants respond to a stimulus\u2014from opening to light, to\nwrapping a tendril around a branch, to capturing prey.\nReproduction\nSingle-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares to divide to\nform two new cells. Multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive germline, gamete, oocyte, and sperm cells.\nAfter fertilization (the fusion of an oocyte and a sperm cell), a new individual develops. When reproduction occurs, DNA\n1.2 \u2022 Themes and Concepts of Biology\n17\ncontaining genes are passed along to an organism\u2019s offspring. These genes ensure that the offspring will belong to the same\nspecies and will have similar characteristics, such as size and shape.\nAdaptation\nAll living organisms exhibit a \u201cfit\u201d to their environment. Biologists refer to this fit as adaptation, and it is a consequence of\nevolution by natural selection, which operates in every lineage of reproducing organisms. Examples of adaptations are diverse\nand unique, from heat-resistant Archaea that live in boiling hotsprings to the tongue length of a nectar-feeding moth that\nmatches the size of the flower from which it feeds. All adaptations enhance the reproductive potential of the individuals\nexhibiting them, including their ability to survive to reproduce. Adaptations are not constant. As an environment changes,\nnatural selection causes the characteristics of the individuals in a population to track those changes.\nGrowth and Development\nOrganisms grow and develop as a result of genes providing specific instructions that will direct cellular growth and\ndevelopment. This ensures that a species\u2019 young (Figure 1.12) will grow up to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its\nparents.\nFigure 1.12 Although no two look alike, these kittens have inherited genes from both parents and share many of the same characteristics.\n(credit: Rocky Mountain Feline Rescue)\nRegulation/Homeostasis\nEven the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal functions,\nrespond to stimuli, and cope with environmental stresses. Two examples of internal functions regulated in an organism are\nnutrient transport and blood flow. Organs (groups of tissues working together) perform specific functions, such as carrying\noxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body.\nFigure 1.13 Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and other mammals living in ice-covered regions maintain their body temperature by generating\nheat and reducing heat loss through thick fur and a dense layer of fat under their skin. (credit: \u201clonghorndave\u201d/Flickr)\nIn order to function properly, cells require appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and appropriate\nconcentration of diverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms are able to\n18\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nmaintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, through homeostasis\n(literally, \u201csteady state\u201d). For example, an organism needs to regulate body temperature through the thermoregulation process.\nOrganisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (Figure 1.13), have body structures that help them withstand low\ntemperatures and conserve body heat. Structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur, feathers, blubber, and fat. In hot\nclimates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat.\nEnergy Processing\nFigure 1.14 The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) uses chemical energy derived from food to power flight.

(credit: Pacific Southwest Region U.S. Fish\nand Wildlife Service)\nAll organisms use a source of energy for their metabolic activities. Some organisms capture energy from the sun and convert it\ninto chemical energy in food. Others use chemical energy in molecules they take in as food (Figure 1.14).\nEvolution\nThe diversity of life on Earth is a result of mutations, or random changes in hereditary material over time. These mutations allow\nthe possibility for organisms to adapt to a changing environment. An organism that evolves characteristics fit for the\nenvironment will have greater reproductive success, subject to the forces of natural selection.\nLevels of Organization of Living Things\nLiving things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that we can examine on a scale from small to large. The\natom is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter. It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms form\nmolecules. A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds.\nMany molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules, large molecules that are typically formed by\npolymerization (a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than\nmacromolecules). An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Figure 1.15), which contains the instructions\nfor the structure and functioning of all living organisms.\n1.2 \u2022 Themes and Concepts of Biology\n19\nFigure 1.15 All molecules, including this DNA molecule, are comprised of atoms. (credit: \u201cbrian0918\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/rotating_DNA) that animates the three-dimensional structure of the DNA molecule in\nFigure 1.15.\nSome cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes. We call these organelles. Organelles are small\nstructures that exist within cells. Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out indispensable\nfunctions: mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in\nsunlight to make sugars. All living things are made of cells. The cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and\nfunction in living organisms. (This requirement is why scientists do not consider viruses living: they are not made of cells. To\nmake new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell. Only then can they obtain the\nmaterials they need to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Scientists classify cells as\nprokaryotic or eukaryotic. Prokaryotes are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane-bound nuclei. In\ncontrast, the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane-bound organelles and a membrane-bound nucleus.\nIn larger organisms, cells combine to make tissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions.\nOrgans are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function. Organs are present not only in animals but\nalso in plants. An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs. Mammals have\nmany organ systems. For instance, the circulatory system transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs. It\nincludes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. Organisms are individual living entities. For example, each tree in a forest\nis an organism. Single-celled prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also organisms, which biologists typically call\nmicroorganisms.\n20\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nBiologists collectively call all the individuals of a species living within a specific area a population. For example, a forest may\ninclude many pine trees, which represent the population of pine trees in this forest. Different populations may live in the same\nspecific area. For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants, insects, and microbial\npopulations. A community is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area. For instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects,\nand other populations in a forest form the forest\u2019s community. The forest itself is an ecosystem. An ecosystem consists of all the\nliving things in a particular area together with the abiotic, nonliving parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or\nrain water. At the highest level of organization (Figure 1.16), the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents\nthe zones of life on Earth. It includes land, water, and even the atmosphere to a certain extent.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 1.16 shows the biological levels of organization of living things. From a single organelle to the entire biosphere, living organisms are\nparts of a highly structured hierarchy.

The source of\nthis diversity is evolution, the process of gradual change in a population or species over time. Evolutionary biologists study the\n1.2 \u2022 Themes and Concepts of Biology\n21\nevolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems.\nA phylogenetic tree (Figure 1.17) can summarize the evolution of various life forms on Earth. It is a diagram showing the\nevolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both.\nNodes and branches comprise a phylogenetic tree. The internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when,\nbased on scientific evidence, researchers believe an ancestor has diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch is\nproportional to the time elapsed since the split.\nFigure 1.17 Microbiologist Carl Woese constructed this phylogenetic tree using data that he obtained from sequencing ribosomal RNA\ngenes. The tree shows the separation of living organisms into three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Bacteria and Archaea are\nprokaryotes, single-celled organisms lacking intracellular organelles. (credit: Eric Gaba; NASA Astrobiology Institute)\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nCarl Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree\nIn the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. They based\nthe organizational scheme mainly on physical features, as opposed to physiology, biochemistry, or molecular biology, all of\nwhich modern systematics use. American microbiologist Carl Woese's pioneering work in the early 1970s has shown, however,\nthat life on Earth has evolved along three lineages, now called domains\u2014Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The first two are\nprokaryotic cells with microbes that lack membrane-enclosed nuclei and organelles. The third domain contains the eukaryotes\nand includes unicellular microorganisms (protists), together with the three remaining kingdoms (fungi, plants, and animals).\nWoese defined Archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree (Figure 1.17). Many organisms belonging to\nthe Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. To construct his tree, Woese used genetic\nrelationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape).\nWoese constructed his tree from universally distributed comparative gene sequencing that are present in every organism, and\nconserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged throughout evolution). Woese\u2019s approach was\nrevolutionary because comparing physical features are insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly\nsimilar in spite of their tremendous biochemical diversity and genetic variability (Figure 1.18). Comparing homologous DNA and\nRNA sequences provided Woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes, and which justified\nseparating the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea.\n22\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 1.18 These images represent different domains. The (a) bacteria in this micrograph belong to Domain Bacteria, while the (b)\nextremophiles (not visible) living in this hot vent belong to Domain Archaea.

Biologists may pursue one of those\nsubdisciplines and work in a more focused field. For instance, molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at\nthe molecular and chemical level, including interactions among molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the way\nthey are regulated. Microbiology, the study of microorganisms, is the study of the structure and function of single-celled\norganisms. It is quite a broad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study, there are also microbial physiologists,\necologists, and geneticists, among others.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nForensic Scientist\nForensic science is the application of science to answer questions related to the law. Biologists as well as chemists and\nbiochemists can be forensic scientists. Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their job involves\nexamining trace materials associated with crimes. Interest in forensic science has increased in the last few years, possibly\nbecause of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. Also, developing molecular techniques and\nestablishing DNA databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do. Their job activities are primarily\nrelated to crimes against people such as murder, rape, and assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood,\nand other body fluids and also processing DNA (Figure 1.19) found in many different environments and materials. Forensic\nscientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains. Students who want to\npursue careers in forensic science will most likely have to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math\ncourses.\n1.2 \u2022 Themes and Concepts of Biology\n23\nFigure 1.19 This forensic scientist works in a DNA extraction room at the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory at Fort Gillem, GA.\n(credit: United States Army CID Command Public Affairs)\nAnother field of biological study, neurobiology, studies the biology of the nervous system, and although it is a branch of biology,\nit is also an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience. Because of its interdisciplinary nature, this subdiscipline\nstudies different nervous system functions using molecular, cellular, developmental, medical, and computational approaches.\nFigure 1.20 Researchers work on excavating dinosaur fossils at a site in Castell\u00f3n, Spain. (credit: Mario Modesto)\nPaleontology, another branch of biology, uses fossils to study life\u2019s history (Figure 1.20). Zoology and botany are the study of\nanimals and plants, respectively. Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists, ecologists, or physiologists, to name just a\nfew areas. This is just a small sample of the many fields that biologists can pursue.\nBiology is the culmination of the achievements of the natural sciences from their inception to today. Excitingly, it is the cradle of\nemerging sciences, such as the biology of brain activity, genetic engineering of custom organisms, and the biology of evolution\nthat uses the laboratory tools of molecular biology to retrace the earliest stages of life on Earth. A scan of news\nheadlines\u2014whether reporting on immunizations, a newly discovered species, sports doping, or a genetically-modified\nfood\u2014demonstrates the way biology is active in and important to our everyday world.\n24\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nabstract\nopening section of a scientific paper that\nsummarizes the research and conclusions\napplied science\nform of science that aims to solve real-\nworld problems\natom\nsmallest and most fundamental unit of matter\nbasic science\nscience that seeks to expand knowledge and\nunderstanding regardless of the short-term application\nof that knowledge\nbiochemistry\nstudy of the chemistry of biological\norganisms\nbiology\nthe study of life\nbiosphere\ncollection of all the ecosystems on Earth\nbotany\nstudy of plants\ncell\nsmallest fundamental unit of structure and function in\nliving things\ncommunity\nset of populations inhabiting a particular area\nconclusion\nsection of a scientific paper that summarizes\nthe importance of the experimental findings\ncontrol\npart of an experiment that does not change during\nthe experiment\ndeductive reasoning\nform of logical thinking that uses a\ngeneral inclusive statement to forecast specific results\ndescriptive science\n(also, discovery science) form of science\nthat aims to observe, explore, and investigate\ndiscussion\nsection of a scientific paper in which the author\ninterprets experimental results, describes how variables\nmay be related, and attempts to explain the phenomenon\nin question\necosystem\nall the living things in a particular area together\nwith the abiotic, nonliving parts of that environment\neukaryote\norganism with cells that have nuclei and\nmembrane-bound organelles\nevolution\nthe process of gradual change in a population or\nspecies over time\nfalsifiable\nable to be disproven by experimental results\nhomeostasis\nability of an organism to maintain constant\ninternal conditions\nhypothesis\nsuggested explanation for an observation,\nwhich one can test\nhypothesis-based science\nform of science that begins with\na specific question and potential testable answers\ninductive reasoning\nform of logical thinking that uses\nrelated observations to arrive at a general conclusion\nintroduction\nopening section of a scientific paper, which\nprovides background information about what was known\nin the field prior to the research reported in the paper\nlife science\nfield of science, such as biology, that studies\nliving things\nmacromolecule\nlarge molecule, typically formed by the\njoining of smaller molecules\nmaterials and methods\nsection of a scientific paper that\nincludes a complete description of the substances,\nmethods, and techniques that the researchers used to\ngather data\nmicrobiology\nstudy of the structure and function of\nmicroorganisms\nmolecular biology\nstudy of biological processes and their\nregulation at the molecular level, including interactions\namong molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins\nmolecule\nchemical structure consisting of at least two\natoms held together by one or more chemical bonds\nnatural science\nfield of science that is related to the\nphysical world and its phenomena and processes\nneurobiology\nstudy of the biology of the nervous system\norgan\ncollection of related tissues grouped together\nperforming a common function\norgan system\nlevel of organization that consists of\nfunctionally related interacting organs\norganelle\nsmall structures that exist within cells and carry\nout cellular functions\norganism\nindividual living entity\npaleontology\nstudy of life\u2019s history by means of fossils\npeer-reviewed manuscript\nscientific paper that a\nscientist\u2019s colleagues review who are experts in the field\nof study\nphylogenetic tree\ndiagram showing the evolutionary\nrelationships among various biological species based on\nsimilarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or\nboth;

Science\nhas many fields. Those fields related to the physical world\nand its phenomena are natural sciences.\nScience can be basic or applied. The main goal of basic\nscience is to expand knowledge without any expectation of\nshort-term practical application of that knowledge. The\nprimary goal of applied research, however, is to solve\npractical problems.\nScience uses two types of logical reasoning. Inductive\nreasoning uses particular results to produce general\nscientific principles. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical\nthinking that predicts results by applying general principles.\nThe common thread throughout scientific research is using\nthe scientific method, a step-based process that consists of\nmaking observations, defining a problem, posing\nhypotheses, testing these hypotheses, and drawing one or\nmore conclusions. The testing uses proper controls.\nScientists present their results in peer-reviewed scientific\npapers published in scientific journals. A scientific research\npaper consists of several well-defined sections: introduction,\nmaterials and methods, results, and, finally, a concluding\ndiscussion. Review papers summarize the conducted\nresearch in a particular field over a period of time.\n1.2 Themes and Concepts of\nBiology\nBiology is the science of life. All living organisms share\nseveral key properties such as order, sensitivity or response\nto stimuli, reproduction, growth and development,\nregulation, homeostasis, and energy processing. Living\nthings are highly organized parts of a hierarchy that includes\natoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and\norgan systems. In turn, biologists group organisms as\npopulations, communities, ecosystems, and the biosphere.\nThe great diversity of life today evolved from less-diverse\nancestral organisms over billions of years. We can use a\nphylogenetic tree to show evolutionary relationships among\norganisms.\nBiology is very broad and includes many branches and\nsubdisciplines.

Some\nof the most abundant elements in living organisms include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur,\nand phosphorus. These form the nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids that are the\nfundamental components of living matter. Biologists must understand these important building blocks\nand the unique structures of the atoms that comprise molecules, allowing for cells, tissues, organ\nsystems, and entire organisms to form.\nAll biological processes follow the laws of physics and chemistry, so in order to understand how\nbiological systems work, it is important to understand the underlying physics and chemistry. For\nexample, the flow of blood within the circulatory system follows the laws of physics that regulate the\nmodes of fluid flow. The breakdown of the large, complex molecules of food into smaller molecules\u2014and\nthe conversion of these to release energy to be stored in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\u2014is a series of\nchemical reactions that follow chemical laws. The properties of water and the formation of hydrogen\nbonds are key to understanding living processes. Recognizing the properties of acids and bases is\nimportant, for example, to our understanding of the digestive process. Therefore, the fundamentals of\nphysics and chemistry are important for gaining insight into biological processes.\nChapter Outline\n2.1 Atoms, Isotopes,\nIons, and Molecules:\nThe Building Blocks\n2.2 Water\n2.3 Carbon\n2.1 Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The\nBuilding Blocks\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDefine matter and elements\n\u2022\nDescribe the interrelationship between protons, neutrons, and electrons\n\u2022\nCompare the ways in which electrons can be donated or shared between atoms\n\u2022\nExplain the ways in which naturally occurring elements combine to create molecules, cells,\ntissues, organ systems, and organisms\nAt its most fundamental level, life is made up of matter. Matter is any substance that occupies space and has\nmass. Elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that cannot break\ndown into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions. There are 118 elements, but only 98 occur\nnaturally. The remaining elements are unstable and require scientists to synthesize them in laboratories.\nEach element is designated by its chemical symbol, which is a single capital letter or, when the first letter is\nalready \u201ctaken\u201d by another element, a combination of two letters. Some elements follow the English term for\nthe element, such as C for carbon and Ca for calcium. Other elements\u2019 chemical symbols derive from their\nLatin names. For example, the symbol for sodium is Na, referring to natrium, the Latin word for sodium.\nThe four elements common to all living organisms are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen\n(N). In the nonliving world, elements are found in different proportions, and some elements common to\nliving organisms are relatively rare on the earth as a whole, as Table 2.1 shows. For example, the atmosphere\nis rich in nitrogen and oxygen but contains little carbon and hydrogen, while the earth\u2019s crust, although it\ncontains oxygen and a small amount of hydrogen, has little nitrogen and carbon. In spite of their differences\nin abundance, all elements and the chemical reactions between them obey the same chemical and physical\nlaws regardless of whether they are a part of the living or nonliving world.\nApproximate Percentage of Elements in Living Organisms (Humans) Compared to the Nonliving World\nElement\nLife (Humans)\nAtmosphere\nEarth\u2019s Crust\nOxygen (O)\n65%\n21%\n46%\nCarbon (C)\n18%\ntrace\ntrace\nHydrogen (H)\n10%\ntrace\n0.1%\nNitrogen (N)\n3%\n78%\ntrace\nTable 2.1\nThe Structure of the Atom\nTo understand how elements come together, we must first discuss the element's smallest component or\nbuilding block, the atom. An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the element's chemical\nproperties. For example, one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room\ntemperature. A gold coin is simply a very large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and\ncontains small amounts of other elements known as impurities. We cannot break down gold atoms into\nanything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold.\nAn atom is composed of two regions: the nucleus, which is in the atom's center and contains protons and\nneutrons. The atom's outermost region holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus, as Figure 2.2\nillustrates. Atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons, among other subatomic particles. The only\nexception is hydrogen (H), which is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons.\n30\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 2.2 Elements, such as helium, depicted here, are made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the\nnucleus, with electrons in orbitals surrounding the nucleus.\nProtons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 \u00d7 10-24 grams. Scientists arbitrarily define this amount of\nmass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton, as Table 2.2 shows. Although similar in mass, protons and neutrons differ in\ntheir electric charge. A proton is positively charged; whereas, a neutron is uncharged. Therefore, the number of neutrons in an\natom contributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge. Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons, weighing\nonly 9.11 \u00d7 10-28 grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. Hence, they do not contribute much to an element\u2019s overall\natomic mass. Therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons and calculate the\natom\u2019s mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone. Although not significant contributors to mass, electrons do\ncontribute greatly to the atom\u2019s charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the proton's positive charge. In\nuncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. In\nthese atoms, the positive and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with no net charge.\nAccounting for the sizes of protons, neutrons, and electrons, most of the atom's volume\u2014greater than 99 percent\u2014is empty\nspace. With all this empty space, one might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another. The reason they\ndo not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged and negative charges repel each other.\nProtons, Neutrons, and Electrons\nCharge\nMass (amu)\nLocation\nProton\n+1\n1\nnucleus\nNeutron\n0\n1\nnucleus\nElectron\n\u20131\n0\norbitals\nTable 2.2\nAtomic Number and Mass\nAtoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. The number of protons determines an\nelement\u2019s atomic number, which scientists use to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable,\nresulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess.\nTogether, the number of protons and neutrons determine an element\u2019s mass number, as Figure 2.3 illustrates. Note that we\ndisregard the small contribution of mass from electrons in calculating the mass number. We can use this approximation of mass\nto easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number.\nSince an element\u2019s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the atomic mass, which is the\ncalculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number contains a fraction. For\nexample, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with\natomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons).\n2.1 \u2022 Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks\n31\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 2.3 Carbon has an atomic number of six, and two stable isotopes with mass numbers of twelve and thirteen, respectively. Its relative\natomic mass is 12.011\nHow many neutrons do carbon-12 and carbon-13 have, respectively?\nIsotopes\nIsotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. Some\nelements\u2014such as carbon, potassium, and uranium\u2014have naturally occurring isotopes. Carbon-12 contains six protons, six\nneutrons, and six electrons; therefore, it has a mass number of 12 (six protons and six neutrons). Carbon-14 contains six protons,\neight neutrons, and six electrons; its atomic mass is 14 (six protons and eight neutrons). These two alternate forms of carbon are\nisotopes. Some isotopes may emit neutrons, protons, and electrons, and attain a more stable atomic configuration (lower level\nof potential energy); these are radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes. Radioactive decay (carbon-14 decaying to eventually\nbecome nitrogen-14) describes the energy loss that occurs when an unstable atom\u2019s nucleus releases radiation.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nCarbon Dating\nCarbon is normally present in the atmosphere in the form of gaseous compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. Carbon-14\n(14C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere from atmospheric 14N (nitrogen) by the addition of a\nneutron and the loss of a proton because of cosmic rays. This is a continuous process, so more 14C is always being created. As a\nliving organism incorporates 14C initially as carbon dioxide fixed in the process of photosynthesis, the relative amount of 14C in\nits body is equal to the concentration of 14C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting 14C, so the ratio\nbetween 14C and 12C will decline as 14C decays gradually to 14N by a process called beta decay\u2014electrons or positrons emission.\nThis decay emits energy in a slow process.\nAfter approximately 5,730 years, half of the starting concentration of 14C will convert back to 14N. We call the time it takes for half\nof the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable form its half-life. Because the half-life of 14C is long,\nscientists use it to date formerly living objects such as old bones or wood. Comparing the ratio of the 14C concentration in an\nobject to the amount of 14C in the atmosphere, scientists can determine the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed. On\nthe basis of this amount, Figure 2.4 shows that we can calculate the age of the material, such as the pygmy mammoth, with\naccuracy if it is not much older than about 50,000 years. Other elements have isotopes with different half lives. For example, 40K\n(potassium-40) has a half-life of 1.25 billion years, and 235U (Uranium 235) has a half-life of about 700 million years. Through the\nuse of radiometric dating, scientists can study the age of fossils or other remains of extinct organisms to understand how\norganisms have evolved from earlier species.\n32\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 2.4 Scientists can determine the age of carbon-containing remains less than about 50,000 years old, such as this pygmy mammoth,\nusing carbon dating.

Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (1834\u20131907) in 1869,\nthe table groups elements that, although unique, share certain chemical properties with other elements. The properties of\nelements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature: they may be gases, solids, or liquids. Elements also have\nspecific chemical reactivity, the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other.\nIn the periodic table in Figure 2.5, the elements are organized and displayed according to their atomic number and are arranged\nin a series of rows and columns based on shared chemical and physical properties. In addition to providing the atomic number\nfor each element, the periodic table also displays the element\u2019s atomic mass. Looking at carbon, for example, its symbol (C) and\nname appear, as well as its atomic number of six (in the upper left-hand corner) and its atomic mass of 12.01.\n2.1 \u2022 Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks\n33\nFigure 2.5 The periodic table shows each element's atomic mass and atomic number. The atomic number appears above the symbol for the\nelement and the approximate atomic mass appears below it.\nThe periodic table groups elements according to chemical properties. Scientists base the differences in chemical reactivity\nbetween the elements on the number and spatial distribution of an atom\u2019s electrons. Atoms that chemically react and bond to\neach other form molecules. Molecules are simply two or more atoms chemically bonded together. Logically, when two atoms\nchemically bond to form a molecule, their electrons, which form the outermost region of each atom, come together first as the\natoms form a chemical bond.\nElectron Shells and the Bohr Model\nNote that there is a connection between the number of protons in an element, the atomic number that distinguishes one\nelement from another, and the number of electrons it has. In all electrically neutral atoms, the number of electrons is the same\nas the number of protons. Thus, each element, at least when electrically neutral, has a characteristic number of electrons equal\nto its atomic number.\nIn 1913, Danish scientist Niels Bohr (1885\u20131962) developed an early model of the atom. The Bohr model shows the atom as a\ncentral nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific distances from the nucleus,\nas Figure 2.6 illustrates. These orbits form electron shells or energy levels, which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons\nin the outermost shells. These energy levels are designated by a number and the symbol \u201cn.\u201d For example, 1n represents the first\nenergy level located closest to the nucleus.\n34\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 2.6 In 1913, Niels Bohrs developed the Bohr model in which electrons exist within principal shells. An electron normally exists in\nthe lowest energy shell available, which is the one closest to the nucleus. Energy from a photon of light can bump it up to a higher energy\nshell, but this situation is unstable, and the electron quickly decays back to the ground state. In the process, it releases a photon of light.\nElectrons fill orbitals in a consistent order: they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to fill orbitals of\nincreasing energy further from the nucleus. If there are multiple orbitals of equal energy, they fill with one electron in each\nenergy level before adding a second electron. The electrons of the outermost energy level determine the atom's energetic stability\nand its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules.\nUnder standard conditions, atoms fill the inner shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost\nshell. The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight\nelectrons. This is known as the octet rule, which states, with the exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are more stable\nenergetically when they have eight electrons in their valence shell, the outermost electron shell. Figure 2.7 shows examples of\nsome neutral atoms and their electron configurations. Notice that in Figure 2.7, helium has a complete outer electron shell, with\ntwo electrons filling its first and only shell. Similarly, neon has a complete outer 2n shell containing eight electrons. In contrast,\nchlorine and sodium have seven and one in their outer shells, respectively, but theoretically they would be more energetically\nstable if they followed the octet rule and had eight.\n2.1 \u2022 Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks\n35\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 2.7 Bohr diagrams indicate how many electrons fill each principal shell. Group 18 elements (helium, neon, and argon) have a full\nouter, or valence, shell. A full valence shell is the most stable electron configuration. Elements in other groups have partially filled valence\nshells and gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration.\nAn atom may give, take, or share electrons with another atom to achieve a full valence shell, the most stable electron\nconfiguration. Looking at this figure, how many electrons do elements in group 1 need to lose in order to achieve a stable\nelectron configuration? How many electrons do elements in groups 14 and 17 need to gain to achieve a stable configuration?\nUnderstanding that the periodic table's organization is based on the total number of protons (and electrons) helps us know how\nelectrons distribute themselves among the shells. The periodic table is arranged in columns and rows based on the number of\nelectrons and their location. Examine more closely some of the elements in the table\u2019s far right column in Figure 2.5. The group\n18 atoms helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) all have filled outer electron shells, making it unnecessary for them to share\nelectrons with other atoms to attain stability. They are highly stable as single atoms. Because they are non reactive, scientists\ncoin them inert (or noble gases). Compare this to the group 1 elements in the left-hand column. These elements, including\nhydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na), all have one electron in their outermost shells. That means that they can achieve a\nstable configuration and a filled outer shell by donating or sharing one electron with another atom or a molecule such as water.\nHydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration, while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to\nbecome stable. As a result of losing a negatively charged electron, they become positively charged ions. Group 17 elements,\nincluding fluorine and chlorine, have seven electrons in their outmost shells, so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from\nother atoms or molecules, making them negatively charged ions. Group 14 elements, of which carbon is the most important to\nliving systems, have four electrons in their outer shell allowing them to make several covalent bonds (discussed below) with\nother atoms. Thus, the periodic table's columns represent the potential shared state of these elements\u2019 outer electron shells that\nis responsible for their similar chemical characteristics.\nElectron Orbitals\nAlthough useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements, the Bohr model does not accurately reflect\nhow electrons spatially distribute themselves around the nucleus. They do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbits the sun, but\nwe find them in electron orbitals. These relatively complex shapes result from the fact that electrons behave not just like\nparticles, but also like waves. Mathematical equations from quantum mechanics, which scientists call wave functions, can\npredict within a certain level of probability where an electron might be at any given time. Scientists call the area where an\nelectron is most likely to be found its orbital.\n36\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nRecall that the Bohr model depicts an atom\u2019s electron shell configuration. Within each electron shell are subshells, and each\nsubshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate exactly an electron's location,\nscientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. The letter s, p, d, and f designate the subshells. The s\nsubshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital. Principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital, which can hold two electrons.\nPrincipal shell 2n has one s and one p subshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons. The p subshell has three dumbbell-shaped\norbitals, as Figure 2.8 illustrates. Subshells d and f have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals, respectively.\nWe do not show these in the illustration. Principal shell 3n has s, p, and d subshells and can hold 18 electrons. Principal shell 4n\nhas s, p, d and f orbitals and can hold 32 electrons. Moving away from the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals in the\nenergy levels increases. Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table, we can determine the electron structure by\nfitting an extra electron into the next available orbital.\nFigure 2.8 The s subshells are shaped like spheres. Both the 1n and 2n principal shells have an s orbital, but the size of the sphere is larger\nin the 2n orbital. Each sphere is a single orbital. Three dumbbell-shaped orbitals comprise p subshells. Principal shell 2n has a p subshell,\nbut shell 1 does not.\nThe closest orbital to the nucleus, the 1s orbital, can hold up to two electrons. This orbital is equivalent to the Bohr model's\ninnermost electron shell. Scientists call it the 1s orbital because it is spherical around the nucleus. The 1s orbital is the closest\norbital to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital fills. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it occupies\nonly one spot within the 1s orbital. We designate this as 1s1, where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1s\norbital. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the 1s orbital with its two electrons. We designate this as 1s2,\nreferring to the two electrons of helium in the 1s orbital. On the periodic table Figure 2.5, hydrogen and helium are the only two\nelements in the first row (period). This is because they only have electrons in their first shell, the 1s orbital. Hydrogen and helium\nare the only two elements that have the 1s and no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state.\nThe second electron shell may contain eight electrons. This shell contains another spherical s orbital and three \u201cdumbbell\u201d\nshaped p orbitals, each of which can hold two electrons, as Figure 2.8 shows. After the 1s orbital fills, the second electron shell\nfills, first filling its 2s orbital and then its three p orbitals. When filling the p orbitals, each takes a single electron. Once each p\norbital has an electron, it may add a second. Lithium (Li) contains three electrons that occupy the first and second shells. Two\nelectrons fill the 1s orbital, and the third electron then fills the 2s orbital. Its electron configuration is 1s22s1. Neon (Ne),\nalternatively, has a total of ten electrons: two are in its innermost 1s orbital and eight fill its second shell (two each in the 2s and\nthree p orbitals). Thus it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other\natoms. Larger elements have additional orbitals, comprising the third electron shell. While the concepts of electron shells and\norbitals are closely related, orbitals provide a more accurate depiction of an atom's electron configuration because the orbital\n2.1 \u2022 Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks\n37\nmodel specifies the different shapes and special orientations of all the places that electrons may occupy.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this visual animation to see the spatial arrangement of the p and s orbitals.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/orbitals)\nChemical Reactions and Molecules\nAll elements are most stable when their outermost shell is filled with electrons according to the octet rule. This is because it is\nenergetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable. However, since not all elements have\nenough electrons to fill their outermost shells, atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons\nthey need to attain a stable electron configuration. When two or more atoms chemically bond with each other, the resultant\nchemical structure is a molecule. The familiar water molecule, H2O, consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. These\nbond together to form water, as Figure 2.9 illustrates. Atoms can form molecules by donating, accepting, or sharing electrons to\nfill their outer shells.\nFigure 2.9 Two or more atoms may bond with each other to form a molecule. When two hydrogens and an oxygen share electrons via\ncovalent bonds it forms a water molecule.\nChemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms break apart.\nScientists call the substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction reactants (usually on the left side of a chemical\nequation), and we call the substances at the end of the reaction products (usually on the right side of a chemical equation). We\ntypically draw an arrow between the reactants and products to indicate the chemical reaction's direction. This direction is not\nalways a \u201cone-way street.\u201d To create the water molecule above, the chemical equation would be:\nAn example of a simple chemical reaction is breaking down hydrogen peroxide molecules, each of which consists of two\nhydrogen atoms bonded to two oxygen atoms (H2O2). The reactant hydrogen peroxide breaks down into water, containing one\noxygen atom bound to two hydrogen atoms (H2O), and oxygen, which consists of two bonded oxygen atoms (O2). In the\nequation below, the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and two water molecules. This is an example of a\nbalanced chemical equation, wherein each element's number of atoms is the same on each side of the equation. According to\nthe law of conservation of matter, the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should be equal, such that no atoms\nare, under normal circumstances, created or destroyed.\nEven though all of the reactants and products of this reaction are molecules (each atom remains bonded to at least one other\natom), in this reaction only hydrogen peroxide and water are representatives of compounds: they contain atoms of more than\none type of element. Molecular oxygen, alternatively, as Figure 2.10 shows, consists of two doubly bonded oxygen atoms and is\nnot classified as a compound but as a homonuclear molecule.\n38\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 2.10 A double bond joins the oxygen atoms in an O2 molecule.\nSome chemical reactions, such as the one above, can proceed in one direction until they expend all the reactants. The equations\nthat describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible. Reversible reactions are those that can go in\neither direction. In reversible reactions, reactants turn into products, but when the product's concentration goes beyond a\ncertain threshold (characteristic of the particular reaction), some of these products convert back into reactants. At this point,\nproduct and reactant designations reverse. This back and forth continues until a certain relative balance between reactants and\nproducts occurs\u2014a state called equilibrium. A chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the\nreactants and products often denote these reversible reaction situations.\nFor example, in human blood, excess hydrogen ions (H+) bind to bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) forming an equilibrium state with\ncarbonic acid (H2CO3). If we added carbonic acid to this system, some of it would convert to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions.\nHowever, biological reactions rarely obtain equilibrium because the concentrations of the reactants or products or both are\nconstantly changing, often with one reaction's product a reactant for another. To return to the example of excess hydrogen ions\nin the blood, forming carbonic acid will be the reaction's major direction. However, the carbonic acid can also leave the body as\ncarbon dioxide gas (via exhalation) instead of converting back to bicarbonate ion, thus driving the reaction to the right by the\nlaw of mass action. These reactions are important for maintaining homeostasis in our blood.\nIons and Ionic Bonds\nSome atoms are more stable when they gain or lose an electron (or possibly two) and form ions. This fills their outermost\nelectron shell and makes them energetically more stable. Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of\nprotons, each ion has a net charge. Cations are positive ions that form by losing electrons. Negative ions form by gaining\nelectrons, which we call anions. We designate anions by their elemental name and change the ending to \u201c-ide\u201d, thus the anion of\nchlorine is chloride, and the anion of sulfur is sulfide.\nScientists refer to this movement of electrons from one element to another as electron transfer. As Figure 2.11 illustrates,\nsodium (Na) only has one electron in its outer electron shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it\ndoes to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons, 11 neutrons, and\nonly 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. We now refer to it as a sodium ion. Chlorine (Cl) in its lowest energy\nstate (called the ground state) has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one\nelectron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons, 17 neutrons, and 18 electrons,\ngiving it a net negative (\u20131) charge. We now refer to it as a chloride ion. In this example, sodium will donate its one electron to\nempty its shell, and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell. Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete\noutermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1\n(sodium cation) or \u20131 (chloride anion) charge. Note that these transactions can normally only take place simultaneously: in order\nfor a sodium atom to lose an electron, it must be in the presence of a suitable recipient like a chlorine atom.\nFigure 2.11 In the formation of an ionic compound, metals lose electrons and nonmetals gain electrons to achieve an octet.\nIonic bonds form between ions with opposite charges. For instance, positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged\nchloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride, or table salt, creating a crystalline molecule with zero net\n2.1 \u2022 Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks\n39\ncharge.\nPhysiologists refer to certain salts as electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, and calcium), ions necessary for nerve impulse\nconduction, muscle contractions, and water balance. Many sports drinks and dietary supplements provide these ions to replace\nthose lost from the body via sweating during exercise.\nCovalent Bonds and Other Bonds and Interactions\nAnother way to satisfy the octet rule is by sharing electrons between atoms to form covalent bonds. These bonds are stronger\nand much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms. We commonly find covalent bonds in carbon-\nbased organic molecules, such as our DNA and proteins. We also find covalent bonds in inorganic molecules like H2O, CO2, and\nO2. The bonds may share one, two, or three pairs of electrons, making single, double, and triple bonds, respectively. The more\ncovalent bonds between two atoms, the stronger their connection. Thus, triple bonds are the strongest.\nThe strength of different levels of covalent bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult time in acquiring\nnitrogen for use in constructing their molecules, even though molecular nitrogen, N2, is the most abundant gas in the\natmosphere. Molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each other and, as with all molecules, sharing\nthese three pairs of electrons between the two nitrogen atoms allows for filling their outer electron shells, making the molecule\nmore stable than the individual nitrogen atoms. This strong triple bond makes it difficult for living systems to break apart this\nnitrogen in order to use it as constituents of proteins and DNA.\nForming water molecules provides an example of covalent bonding. Covalent bonds bind the hydrogen and oxygen atoms that\ncombine to form water molecules as Figure 2.9 shows. The electron from the hydrogen splits its time between the hydrogen\natoms' incomplete outer shell and the oxygen atoms' incomplete outer shell. To completely fill the oxygen's outer shell, which has\nsix electrons but which would be more stable with eight, two electrons (one from each hydrogen atom) are needed: hence, the\nwell-known formula H2O. The two elements share the electrons to fill the outer shell of each, making both elements more stable.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView this short video to see an animation of ionic and covalent bonding.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/ionic_covalent)\nPolar Covalent Bonds\nThere are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. In a polar covalent bond, Figure 2.12 shows atoms unequally share\nthe electrons and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other. Because of the unequal electron distribution between the\natoms of different elements, a slightly positive (\u03b4+) or slightly negative (\u03b4\u2013) charge develops. This partial charge is an important\nproperty of water and accounts for many of its characteristics.\nWater is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge.\nThis occurs because the oxygen atom's nucleus is more attractive to the hydrogen atoms' electrons than the hydrogen nucleus is\nto the oxygen\u2019s electrons. Thus, oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time\nnear the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen atoms' nucleus, giving the oxygen and hydrogen atoms slightly negative and positive\ncharges, respectively. Another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is\nmore likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus. Either way, the atom\u2019s relative electronegativity contributes to developing\npartial charges whenever one element is significantly more electronegative than the other, and the charges that these polar\nbonds generate may then be used to form hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite partial charges. (Hydrogen bonds,\nwhich we discuss in detail below, are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively\ncharged atoms in other molecules.) Since macromolecules often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity, polar\nbonds are often present in organic molecules.\nNonpolar Covalent Bonds\nNonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons\nequally. For example, molecular oxygen (O2) is nonpolar because the electrons distribute equally between the two oxygen atoms.\nFigure 2.12 also shows another example of a nonpolar covalent bond\u2014methane (CH4). Carbon has four electrons in its\noutermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It obtains these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one, making\na stable outer shell of eight electrons. Carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but are similar; thus,\n40\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nnonpolar bonds form. The hydrogen atoms each need one electron for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains two\nelectrons. These elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms, creating a nonpolar covalent\nmolecule.\nFigure 2.12 Whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar depends both on bond type and molecular shape. Both water and carbon dioxide have\npolar covalent bonds, but carbon dioxide is linear, so the partial charges on the molecule cancel each other out.\nHydrogen Bonds and Van Der Waals Interactions\nIonic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break. Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent, which determines\ntheir behavior in biological systems. However, not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form between\nmolecules. Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Without these two types\nof bonds, life as we know it would not exist. Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical, life-sustaining properties of water\nand also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA, the building block of cells.\nWhen polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because\nhydrogen\u2019s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen. Because the hydrogen is\nslightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges. When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the\nhydrogen's \u03b4+ from one molecule and the molecule's \u03b4\u2013 charge on another molecule with the more electronegative atoms,\nusually oxygen. Scientists call this interaction a hydrogen bond. This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between\nwater molecules. Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken; however, they occur in very large numbers in water and\nin organic polymers, creating a major force in combination. Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA\ndouble helix.\nLike hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules. Van der Waals\nattractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities,\nwhich are not always symmetrical around an atom. For these attractions to happen, the molecules need to be very close to one\nanother. These bonds\u2014along with ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds\u2014contribute to the proteins' three-dimensional structure\nin our cells that is necessary for their proper function.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nPharmaceutical Chemist\nPharmaceutical chemists are responsible for developing new drugs and trying to determine the mode of action of both old and\nnew drugs. They are involved in every step of the drug development process. We can find drugs in the natural environment or we\ncan synthesize them in the laboratory. In many cases, chemists chemically change potential drugs from nature chemically in the\nlaboratory to make them safer and more effective, and sometimes synthetic versions of drugs substitute for the version we find\n2.1 \u2022 Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks\n41\nin nature.\nAfter a drug's initial discovery or synthesis, the chemist then develops the drug, perhaps chemically altering it, testing it to see if\nit is toxic, and then designing methods for efficient large-scale production. Then, the process of approving the drug for human\nuse begins. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) handles drug approval. This involves a series of large-\nscale experiments using human subjects to ensure the drug is not harmful and effectively treats the condition for which it is\nintended. This process often takes several years and requires the participation of physicians and scientists, in addition to\nchemists, to complete testing and gain approval.\nAn example of a drug that was originally discovered in a living organism is Paclitaxel (Taxol), an anti-cancer drug used to treat\nbreast cancer. This drug was discovered in the bark of the pacific yew tree. Another example is aspirin, originally isolated from\nwillow tree bark. Finding drugs often means testing hundreds of samples of plants, fungi, and other forms of life to see if they\ncontain any biologically active compounds. Sometimes, traditional medicine can give modern medicine clues as to where to find\nan active compound. For example, mankind has used willow bark to make medicine for thousands of years, dating back to\nancient Egypt. However, it was not until the late 1800s that scientists and pharmaceutical companies purified and marketed the\naspirin molecule, acetylsalicylic acid, for human use.\nOccasionally, drugs developed for one use have unforeseen effects that allow usage in other, unrelated ways. For example,\nscientists originally developed the drug minoxidil (Rogaine) to treat high blood pressure. When tested on humans, researchers\nnoticed that individuals taking the drug would grow new hair. Eventually the pharmaceutical company marketed the drug to\nmen and women with baldness to restore lost hair.\nA pharmaceutical chemist's career may involve detective work, experimentation, and drug development, all with the goal of\nmaking human beings healthier.\n2.2 Water\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the properties of water that are critical to maintaining life\n\u2022\nExplain why water is an excellent solvent\n\u2022\nProvide examples of water\u2019s cohesive and adhesive properties\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of acids, bases, and buffers in homeostasis\nWhy do scientists spend time looking for water on other planets? Why is water so important? It is because water is essential to\nlife as we know it. Water is one of the more abundant molecules and the one most critical to life on Earth. Water comprises\napproximately 60\u201370 percent of the human body. Without it, life as we know it simply would not exist.\nThe polarity of the water molecule and its resulting hydrogen bonding make water a unique substance with special properties\nthat are intimately tied to the processes of life. Life originally evolved in a watery environment, and most of an organism\u2019s\ncellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery contents of the cell\u2019s cytoplasm. Special properties of water are its\nhigh heat capacity and heat of vaporization, its ability to dissolve polar molecules, its cohesive and adhesive properties, and its\ndissociation into ions that leads to generating pH. Understanding these characteristics of water helps to elucidate its\nimportance in maintaining life.\nWater\u2019s Polarity\nOne of water\u2019s important properties is that it is composed of polar molecules: the hydrogen and oxygen within water molecules\n(H2O) form polar covalent bonds. While there is no net charge to a water molecule, water's polarity creates a slightly positive\ncharge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen, contributing to water\u2019s properties of attraction. Water generates\ncharges because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, making it more likely that a shared electron would be near the\noxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nucleus, thus generating the partial negative charge near the oxygen.\nAs a result of water\u2019s polarity, each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite charges between\nwater molecules, forming hydrogen bonds. Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions. We call a polar\nsubstance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water hydrophilic (hydro- = \u201cwater\u201d; -philic = \u201cloving\u201d). In contrast, nonpolar\nmolecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water, as Figure 2.13 shows. A good example of this is vinegar and oil\nsalad dressing (an acidic water solution). We call such nonpolar compounds hydrophobic (hydro- = \u201cwater\u201d; -phobic = \u201cfearing\u201d).\n42\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 2.13 Oil and water do not mix. As this macro image of oil and water shows, oil does not dissolve in water but forms droplets instead.\nThis is because it is a nonpolar compound. (credit: Gautam Dogra).\nWater\u2019s States: Gas, Liquid, and Solid\nThe formation of hydrogen bonds is an important quality of the liquid water that is crucial to life as we know it. As water\nmolecules make hydrogen bonds with each other, water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other\nliquids and, since living things have a high water content, understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life. In\nliquid water, hydrogen bonds constantly form and break as the water molecules slide past each other. The water molecules'\nmotion (kinetic energy) causes the bonds to break due to the heat contained in the system. When the heat rises as water boils,\nthe water molecules' higher kinetic energy causes the hydrogen bonds to break completely and allows water molecules to escape\ninto the air as gas (steam or water vapor). Alternatively, when water temperature reduces and water freezes, the water molecules\nform a crystalline structure maintained by hydrogen bonding (there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds) that\nmakes ice less dense than liquid water, a phenomenon that we do not see when other liquids solidify.\nWater\u2019s lower density in its solid form is due to the way hydrogen bonds orient as they freeze: the water molecules push farther\napart compared to liquid water. With most other liquids, solidification when the temperature drops includes lowering kinetic\nenergy between molecules, allowing them to pack even more tightly than in liquid form and giving the solid a greater density\nthan the liquid.\nThe lower density of ice, as Figure 2.14 depicts, an anomaly causes it to float at the surface of liquid water, such as in an iceberg\nor ice cubes in a glass of water. In lakes and ponds, ice will form on the water's surface creating an insulating barrier that\nprotects the animals and plant life in the pond from freezing. Without this insulating ice layer, plants and animals living in the\npond would freeze in the solid block of ice and could not survive. The expansion of ice relative to liquid water causes the\ndetrimental effect of freezing on living organisms. The ice crystals that form upon freezing rupture the delicate membranes\nessential for living cells to function, irreversibly damaging them. Cells can only survive freezing if another liquid like glycerol\ntemporarily replaces the water in them.\n2.2 \u2022 Water\n43\nFigure 2.14 Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water. The (a) lattice structure of ice makes it less dense than the liquid\nwater's freely flowing molecules, enabling it to (b) float on water.

Water has the highest specific\nheat capacity of any liquids. We define specific heat as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to\nchange its temperature by one degree Celsius. For water, this amount is one calorie. It therefore takes water a long time to heat\nand a long time to cool. In fact, water's specific heat capacity is about five times more than that of sand. This explains why the\nland cools faster than the sea. Due to its high heat capacity, warm blooded animals use water to more evenly disperse heat in\ntheir bodies: it acts in a similar manner to a car\u2019s cooling system, transporting heat from warm places to cool places, causing the\nbody to maintain a more even temperature.\nWater\u2019s Heat of Vaporization\nWater also has a high heat of vaporization, the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid substance to a gas. A\nconsiderable amount of heat energy (586 cal) is required to accomplish this change in water. This process occurs on the water's\nsurface. As liquid water heats up, hydrogen bonding makes it difficult to separate the liquid water molecules from each other,\nwhich is required for it to enter its gaseous phase (steam). As a result, water acts as a heat sink or heat reservoir and requires\nmuch more heat to boil than does a liquid such as ethanol (grain alcohol), whose hydrogen bonding with other ethanol\nmolecules is weaker than water\u2019s hydrogen bonding. Eventually, as water reaches its boiling point of 100\u00b0 Celsius (212\u00b0\nFahrenheit), the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules, and the kinetic energy (motion) between\nthe water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas. Even when below its boiling point, water\u2019s individual\nmolecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape and vaporize:\nwe call this process evaporation.\nThe fact that hydrogen bonds need to be broken for water to evaporate means that bonds use a substantial amount of energy in\nthe process. As the water evaporates, energy is taken up by the process, cooling the environment where the evaporation is taking\nplace. In many living organisms, including in humans, the evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows the organism\nto cool so that it can maintain homeostasis of body temperature.\nWater\u2019s Solvent Properties\nSince water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges, ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve\nin it. Therefore, we refer to water as a solvent, a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds. The\ncharges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water, surrounding the particle with water molecules.\nWe refer to this as a sphere of hydration, or a hydration shell, as Figure 2.15 illustrates and serves to keep the particles separated\nor dispersed in the water.\n1W. Humphrey W., A. Dalke, and K. Schulten, \u201cVMD\u2014Visual Molecular Dynamics,\u201d Journal of Molecular Graphics 14 (1996): 33-38.\n44\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nWhen we add ionic compounds to water, the individual ions react with the water molecules' polar regions and their ionic bonds\nare disrupted in the process of dissociation. Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and\nform ions. Consider table salt (NaCl, or sodium chloride): when we add NaCl crystals to water, the NaCl molecules dissociate\ninto Na+ and Cl\u2013 ions, and spheres of hydration form around the ions, as Figure 2.15 illustrates. The partially negative charge of\nthe water molecule\u2019s oxygen surrounds the positively charged sodium ion. The hydrogen's partially positive charge on the water\nmolecule surrounds the negatively charged chloride ion.\nFigure 2.15 When we mix table salt (NaCl) in water, it forms spheres of hydration around the ions.\nWater\u2019s Cohesive and Adhesive Properties\nHave you ever filled a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops? Before it overflows, the water forms\na dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because of the property of cohesion. In\ncohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules together at the\nliquid-gas (water-air) interface, although there is no more room in the glass.\nCohesion allows for surface tension, the capacity of a substance to withstand rupturing when placed under tension or stress.\nThis is also why water forms droplets when on a dry surface rather than flattening by gravity. When we place a small scrap of\npaper onto a water droplet, the paper floats on top even though paper is denser (heavier) than the water. Cohesion and surface\ntension keep the water molecules' hydrogen bonds intact and support the item floating on the top. It\u2019s even possible to \u201cfloat\u201d a\nneedle on top of a glass of water if you place it gently without breaking the surface tension, as Figure 2.16 shows.\nFigure 2.16 A needle's weight pulls the surface downward. At the same time, the surface tension pulls it up, suspending it on the water's\nsurface preventing it from sinking. Notice the indentation in the water around the needle. (credit: Cory Zanker)\nThese cohesive forces are related to water\u2019s property of adhesion, or the attraction between water molecules and other\nmolecules. This attraction is sometimes stronger than water\u2019s cohesive forces, especially when the water is exposed to charged\nsurfaces such as those on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes. We observe adhesion when water \u201cclimbs\u201d up\nthe tube placed in a glass of water: notice that the water appears to be higher on the tube's sides than in the middle. This is\nbecause the water molecules are attracted to the capillary's charged glass walls more than they are to each other and therefore\nadhere to it. We call this type of adhesion capillary action, as Figure 2.17 illustrates.\n2.2 \u2022 Water\n45\nFigure 2.17 The adhesive forces exerted by the glass' internal surface exceeding the cohesive forces between the water molecules\nthemselves causes capillary action in a glass tube. (credit: modification of work by Pearson-Scott Foresman, donated to the Wikimedia\nFoundation)\nWhy are cohesive and adhesive forces important for life? Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for transporting water\nfrom the roots to the leaves in plants. These forces create a \u201cpull\u201d on the water column. This pull results from the tendency of\nwater molecules evaporating on the plant's surface to stay connected to water molecules below them, and so they are pulled\nalong. Plants use this natural phenomenon to help transport water from their roots to their leaves. Without these properties of\nwater, plants would be unable to receive the water and the dissolved minerals they require. In another example, insects such as\nthe water strider, as Figure 2.18 shows, use the water's surface tension to stay afloat on the water's surface layer and even mate\nthere.\nFigure 2.18 Water\u2019s cohesive and adhesive properties allow this water strider (Gerris sp.) to stay afloat.

You might have even used some to test whether the water in a\nswimming pool is properly treated. In both cases, the pH test measures hydrogen ions' concentration in a given solution.\nHydrogen ions spontaneously generate in pure water by the dissociation (ionization) of a small percentage of water molecules\n46\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ninto equal numbers of hydrogen (H+) ions and hydroxide (OH-) ions. While the hydroxide ions are kept in solution by their\nhydrogen bonding with other water molecules, the hydrogen ions, consisting of naked protons, immediately attract to un-\nionized water molecules, forming hydronium ions (H3O+). Still, by convention, scientists refer to hydrogen ions and their\nconcentration as if they were free in this state in liquid water.\nThe concentration of hydrogen ions dissociating from pure water is 1 \u00d7 10-7 moles H+ ions per liter of water. Moles (mol) are a\nway to express the amount of a substance (which can be atoms, molecules, ions, etc.). One mole represents the atomic weight of\na substance, expressed in grams, which equals the amount of the substance containing as many units as there are atoms in 12\ngrams of 12C. Mathematically, one mole is equal to 6.02 \u00d7 1023 particles of the substance. Therefore, 1 mole of water is equal to\n6.02 \u00d7 1023 water molecules. We calculate the pH as the negative of the base 10 logarithm of this concentration. The log10 of 1 \u00d7\n10-7 is -7.0, and the negative of this number (indicated by the \u201cp\u201d of \u201cpH\u201d) yields a pH of 7.0, which is also a neutral pH. The pH\ninside of human cells and blood are examples of two body areas where near-neutral pH is maintained.\nNon-neutral pH readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water. Using the negative logarithm to generate positive\nintegers, high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number; whereas, low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH.\nAn acid is a substance that increases hydrogen ions' (H+) concentration in a solution, usually by having one of its hydrogen\natoms dissociate. A base provides either hydroxide ions (OH\u2013) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen\nions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH. In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions,\nthese ions bind to free hydrogen ions, generating new water molecules.\nThe stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H+. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) completely dissociates into hydrogen\nand chloride ions and is highly acidic; whereas the acids in tomato juice or vinegar do not completely dissociate and are weak\nacids. Conversely, strong bases are those substances that readily donate OH\u2013or take up hydrogen ions. Sodium hydroxide\n(NaOH) and many household cleaners are highly alkaline and give up OH\u2013 rapidly when we place them in water, thereby raising\nthe pH. An example of a weak basic solution is seawater, which has a pH near 8.0 This is close enough to a neutral pH that\nmarine organisms have adapted in order to live and thrive in a saline environment.\nThe pH scale is, as we previously mentioned, an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 (Figure 2.19). Anything below 7.0\n(ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. Extremes in pH in either direction from\n7.0 are usually inhospitable to life. The pH inside cells (6.8) and the pH in the blood (7.4) are both very close to neutral. However,\nthe environment in the stomach is highly acidic, with a pH of 1 to 2. As a result, how do stomach cells survive in such an acidic\nenvironment? How do they homeostatically maintain the near neutral pH inside them? The answer is that they cannot do it and\nare constantly dying. The stomach constantly produces new cells to replace dead ones, which stomach acids digest. Scientists\nestimate that the human body completely replaces the stomach lining every seven to ten days.\n2.2 \u2022 Water\n47\nFigure 2.19 The pH scale measures hydrogen ions' (H+) concentration in a solution.

Buffers are the key. Buffers readily absorb excess H+ or OH\u2013, keeping the body's pH carefully\nmaintained in the narrow range required for survival. Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person\u2019s well-being. The\nbuffer maintaining the pH of human blood involves carbonic acid (H2CO3), bicarbonate ion (HCO3\u2013), and carbon dioxide (CO2).\nWhen bicarbonate ions combine with free hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid, it removes hydrogen ions and moderates\npH changes. Similarly, as Figure 2.20 shows, excess carbonic acid can convert to carbon dioxide gas which we exhale through the\nlungs. This prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and dangerously reducing the blood\u2019s pH.\nLikewise, if too much OH\u2013 enters into the system, carbonic acid will combine with it to create bicarbonate, lowering the pH.\nWithout this buffer system, the body\u2019s pH would fluctuate enough to put survival in jeopardy.\nFigure 2.20 This diagram shows the body\u2019s buffering of blood pH levels. The blue arrows show the process of raising pH as more CO2 is\nmade. The purple arrows indicate the reverse process: the lowering of pH as more bicarbonate is created.\nOther examples of buffers are antacids that some people use to combat excess stomach acid. Many of these over-the-counter\nmedications work in the same way as blood buffers, usually with at least one ion capable of absorbing hydrogen and moderating\npH, bringing relief to those who suffer \u201cheartburn\u201d after eating. Water's unique properties that contribute to this capacity to\nbalance pH\u2014as well as water\u2019s other characteristics\u2014are essential to sustaining life on Earth.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo learn more about water, visit the U.S. Geological Survey Water Science for Schools (http://openstax.org/l/all_about_water) All\nAbout Water! website.\n48\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n2.3 Carbon\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain why carbon is important for life\n\u2022\nDescribe the role of functional groups in biological molecules\nMany complex molecules called macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), carbohydrates, and lipids\ncomprise cells. The macromolecules are a subset of organic molecules (any carbon-containing liquid, solid, or gas) that are\nespecially important for life. The fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon. The carbon atom has\nunique properties that allow it to form covalent bonds to as many as four different atoms, making this versatile element ideal to\nserve as the basic structural component, or \u201cbackbone,\u201d of the macromolecules.\nIndividual carbon atoms have an incomplete outermost electron shell. With an atomic number of 6 (six electrons and six\nprotons), the first two electrons fill the inner shell, leaving four in the second shell. Therefore, carbon atoms can form up to four\ncovalent bonds with other atoms to satisfy the octet rule. The methane molecule provides an example: it has the chemical\nformula CH4. Each of its four hydrogen atoms forms a single covalent bond with the carbon atom by sharing a pair of electrons.\nThis results in a filled outermost shell.\nHydrocarbons\nHydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen, such as methane (CH4) described above. We\noften use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuels\u2014like the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter. The many covalent\nbonds between the atoms in hydrocarbons store a great amount of energy, which releases when these molecules burn (oxidize).\nMethane, an excellent fuel, is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule, with a central carbon atom bonded to four different hydrogen\natoms, as Figure 2.21 illustrates. The shape of its electron orbitals determines the shape of the methane molecule's geometry,\nwhere the atoms reside in three dimensions. The carbons and the four hydrogen atoms form a tetrahedron, with four triangular\nfaces. For this reason, we describe methane as having tetrahedral geometry.\nFigure 2.21 Methane has a tetrahedral geometry, with each of the four hydrogen atoms spaced 109.5\u00b0 apart.\nAs the backbone of the large molecules of living things, hydrocarbons may exist as linear carbon chains, carbon rings, or\ncombinations of both. Furthermore, individual carbon-to-carbon bonds may be single, double, or triple covalent bonds, and\neach type of bond affects the molecule's geometry in a specific way. This three-dimensional shape or conformation of the large\nmolecules of life (macromolecules) is critical to how they function.\nHydrocarbon Chains\nSuccessive bonds between carbon atoms form hydrocarbon chains. These may be branched or unbranched. Furthermore, a\nmolecule's different geometries of single, double, and triple covalent bonds alter the overall molecule's geometry as Figure 2.22\nillustrates. The hydrocarbons ethane, ethene, and ethyne serve as examples of how different carbon-to-carbon bonds affect the\nmolecule's geometry. The names of all three molecules start with the prefix \u201ceth-,\u201d which is the prefix for two carbon\nhydrocarbons. The suffixes \u201c-ane,\u201d \u201c-ene,\u201d and \u201c-yne\u201d refer to the presence of single, double, or triple carbon-carbon bonds,\nrespectively. Thus, propane, propene, and propyne follow the same pattern with three carbon molecules, butane, butene, and\nbutyne for four carbon molecules, and so on. Double and triple bonds change the molecule's geometry: single bonds allow\nrotation along the bond's axis; whereas, double bonds lead to a planar configuration and triple bonds to a linear one. These\n2.3 \u2022 Carbon\n49\ngeometries have a significant impact on the shape a particular molecule can assume.\nFigure 2.22 When carbon forms single bonds with other atoms, the shape is tetrahedral. When two carbon atoms form a double bond, the\nshape is planar, or flat. Single bonds, like those in ethane, are able to rotate. Double bonds, like those in ethene, cannot rotate, so the atoms\non either side are locked in place.\nHydrocarbon Rings\nSo far, the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons, which consist of linear chains of carbon atoms.\nAnother type of hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbons, consists of closed rings of carbon atoms with alternating single and\ndouble bonds. We find ring structures in aliphatic hydrocarbons, sometimes with the presence of double bonds, which we can\nsee by comparing cyclohexane's structure to benzene in Figure 2.23. Examples of biological molecules that incorporate the\nbenzene ring include some amino acids and cholesterol and its derivatives, including the hormones estrogen and testosterone.\nWe also find the benzene ring in the herbicide 2,4-D. Benzene is a natural component of crude oil and has been classified as a\ncarcinogen. Some hydrocarbons have both aliphatic and aromatic portions. Beta-carotene is an example of such a hydrocarbon.\nFigure 2.23 Carbon can form five- and six-membered rings. Single or double bonds may connect the carbons in the ring, and nitrogen may\nbe substituted for carbon.\nIsomers\nThe three-dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their\nchemistry. We call molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement (structure) of their atoms and/or\nchemical bonds isomers. Structural isomers (like butane and isobutane in Figure 2.24a) differ in the placement of their covalent\nbonds: both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens (C4H10), but the different atom arrangement within the molecules\nleads to differences in their chemical properties. For example, butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches;\nwhereas, isobutane is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans.\nGeometric isomers, alternatively have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the\nsurrounding atoms, especially in carbon-to-carbon double bonds. In the simple molecule butene (C4H8), the two methyl groups\n(CH3) can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the molecule, as Figure 2.24b illustrates. When the carbons are\nbound on the same side of the double bond, this is the cis configuration. If they are on opposite sides of the double bond, it is a\ntrans configuration. In the trans configuration, the carbons form a more or less linear structure; whereas, the carbons in the cis\nconfiguration make a bend (change in direction) of the carbon backbone.\n50\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 2.24 We call molecules that have the same number and type of atoms arranged differently isomers. (a) Structural isomers have a\ndifferent covalent arrangement of atoms. (b) Geometric isomers have a different arrangement of atoms around a double bond. (c)\nEnantiomers are mirror images of each other.\nWhich of the following statements is false?\na.\nMolecules with the formulas CH3CH2COOH and C3H6O2 could be structural isomers.\nb.\nMolecules must have a double bond to be cis-trans isomers.\nc.\nTo be enantiomers, a molecule must have at least three different atoms or groups connected to a central carbon.\nd.\nTo be enantiomers, a molecule must have at least four different atoms or groups connected to a central carbon.\nIn triglycerides (fats and oils), long carbon chains known as fatty acids may contain double bonds, which can be in either the cis\nor trans configuration, as Figure 2.25 illustrates. Fats with at least one double bond between carbon atoms are unsaturated fats.\nWhen some of these bonds are in the cis configuration, the resulting bend in the chain's carbon backbone means that\ntriglyceride molecules cannot pack tightly, so they remain liquid (oil) at room temperature. Alternatively, triglycerides with trans\ndouble bonds (popularly called trans fats), have relatively linear fatty acids that are able to pack tightly together at room\ntemperature and form solid fats. In the human diet, trans fats are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, so many\nfood manufacturers have reduced or eliminated their use in recent years. In contrast to unsaturated fats, we call triglycerides\n2.3 \u2022 Carbon\n51\nwithout double bonds between carbon atoms saturated fats, meaning that they contain all the hydrogen atoms available.\nSaturated fats are a solid at room temperature and usually of animal origin.\nFigure 2.25 These space-filling models show a cis (oleic acid) and a trans (eliadic acid) fatty acid. Notice the bend in the molecule caused\nby the cis configuration.\nEnantiomers\nEnantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three-dimensional\nplacement of atoms so that they are non-superimposable mirror images. Figure 2.26 shows an amino acid alanine example,\nwhere the two structures are nonsuperimposable. In nature, the L-forms of amino acids are predominant in proteins. Some D\nforms of amino acids are seen in the cell walls of bacteria and polypeptides in other organisms. Similarly, the D-form of glucose\nis the main product of photosynthesis and we rarely see the molecule's L-form in nature.\nFigure 2.26 D-alanine and L-alanine are examples of enantiomers or mirror images. L-forms of amino acids are predominant in proteins.\nFunctional Groups\nFunctional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules.\nWe find them along the \u201ccarbon backbone\u201d of macromolecules. Chains and/or rings of carbon atoms with the occasional\nsubstitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen form this carbon backbone. Molecules with other elements in their carbon\nbackbone are substituted hydrocarbons.\nThe functional groups in a macromolecule are usually attached to the carbon backbone at one or several different places along its\nchain and/or ring structure. Each of the four types of macromolecules\u2014proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids\u2014has\nits own characteristic set of functional groups that contributes greatly to its differing chemical properties and its function in\nliving organisms.\nA functional group can participate in specific chemical reactions. Figure 2.27 shows some of the important functional groups in\n52\nChapter 2 \u2022 The Chemical Foundation of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nbiological molecules. They include: hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl. These groups play an\nimportant role in forming molecules like DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. We usually classify functional groups as\nhydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity characteristics. An example of a hydrophobic group is the\nnonpolar methyl molecule. Among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl group in amino acids, some amino acid side\nchains, and the fatty acids that form triglycerides and phospholipids. This carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions (H+)\nfrom the COOH group resulting in the negatively charged COO- group. This contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever\nmolecule on which it is found. Other functional groups, such as the carbonyl group, have a partially negatively charged oxygen\natom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, again making the molecule more hydrophilic.\nFigure 2.27 These functional groups are in many different biological molecules.

It is\ncomprised of elements. All of the 98 elements that occur\nnaturally have unique qualities that allow them to combine\nin various ways to create molecules, which in turn combine\nto form cells, tissues, organ systems, and organisms. Atoms,\nwhich consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the\nsmallest units of an element that retain all of the properties\nof that element. Electrons can transfer, share, or cause\ncharge disparities between atoms to create bonds, including\nionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds, as well as van der Waals\ninteractions.\n2.2 Water\nWater has many properties that are critical to maintaining\nlife. It is a polar molecule, allowing for forming hydrogen\nbonds. Hydrogen bonds allow ions and other polar molecules\nto dissolve in water. Therefore, water is an excellent solvent.\nThe hydrogen bonds between water molecules cause the\nwater to have a high heat capacity, meaning it takes\nconsiderable added heat to raise its temperature. As the\ntemperature rises, the hydrogen bonds between water\ncontinually break and form anew. This allows for the overall\ntemperature to remain stable, although energy is added to\nthe system. Water also exhibits a high heat of vaporization,\nwhich is key to how organisms cool themselves by\nevaporating sweat. Water\u2019s cohesive forces allow for the\nproperty of surface tension; whereas, we see its adhesive\nproperties as water rises inside capillary tubes. The pH value\nis a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution and\nis one of many chemical characteristics that is highly\nregulated in living organisms through homeostasis. Acids\nand bases can change pH values, but buffers tend to\nmoderate the changes they cause. These properties of water\nare intimately connected to the biochemical and physical\nprocesses performed by living organisms, and life would be\n56\nChapter 2 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nvery different if these properties were altered, if it could exist\nat all.\n2.3 Carbon\nThe unique properties of carbon make it a central part of\nbiological molecules. Carbon binds to oxygen, hydrogen, and\nnitrogen covalently to form the many molecules important\nfor cellular function. Carbon has four electrons in its\noutermost shell and can form four bonds.

There are four major biological macromolecule classes (carbohydrates, lipids,\nproteins, and nucleic acids). Each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions.\nFigure 3.1 Foods such as bread, fruit, and cheese are rich sources of biological macromolecules.\n(credit: modification of work by Bengt Nyman)\nINTRODUCTION Food provides the body with the nutrients it needs to survive. Many of these critical\nnutrients are biological macromolecules, or large molecules, necessary for life. Different smaller organic\nmolecule (monomer) combinations build these macromolecules (polymers). What specific biological\nmacromolecules do living things require? How do these molecules form? What functions do they serve?\nWe explore these questions in this chapter.\nChapter Outline\n3.1 Synthesis of\nBiological\nMacromolecules\n3.2 Carbohydrates\n3.3 Lipids\n3.4 Proteins\n3.5 Nucleic Acids\nCombined, these molecules make up the majority of a cell\u2019s dry mass (recall that water makes up the\nmajority of its complete mass). Biological macromolecules are organic, meaning they contain carbon. In\naddition, they may contain hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and additional minor elements.\nDehydration Synthesis\nMost macromolecules are made from single subunits, or building blocks, called monomers. The monomers\ncombine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. In doing so,\nmonomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is dehydration synthesis, which\nmeans \u201cto put together while losing water.\u201d\nFigure 3.2 In the dehydration synthesis reaction above, two glucose molecules link to form the disaccharide maltose.\nIn the process, it forms a water molecule.\nIn a dehydration synthesis reaction (Figure 3.2), the hydrogen of one monomer combines with the hydroxyl\ngroup of another monomer, releasing a water molecule. At the same time, the monomers share electrons\nand form covalent bonds. As additional monomers join, this chain of repeating monomers forms a polymer.\nDifferent monomer types can combine in many configurations, giving rise to a diverse group of\nmacromolecules. Even one kind of monomer can combine in a variety of ways to form several different\npolymers. For example, glucose monomers are the constituents of starch, glycogen, and cellulose.\nHydrolysis\nPolymers break down into monomers during hydrolysis. A chemical reaction occurs when inserting a water\nmolecule across the bond. Breaking a covalent bond with this water molecule in the compound achieves this\n(Figure 3.3). During these reactions, the polymer breaks into two components: one part gains a hydrogen\natom (H+) and the other gains a hydroxyl molecule (OH\u2013) from a split water molecule.\nFigure 3.3 In the hydrolysis reaction here, the disaccharide maltose breaks down to form two glucose monomers by\nadding a water molecule. Note that this reaction is the reverse of the synthesis reaction in Figure 3.2.\nDehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed, or \u201csped up,\u201d by specific enzymes; dehydration\nreactions involve the formation of new bonds, requiring energy, while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and\nrelease energy. These reactions are similar for most macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer\nreaction is specific for its class. For example, catalytic enzymes in the digestive system hydrolyze or break\ndown the food we ingest into smaller molecules. This allows cells in our body to easily absorb nutrients in the\nintestine. A specific enzyme breaks down each macromolecule. For instance, amylase, sucrase, lactase, or\nmaltase break down carbohydrates. Enzymes called proteases, such as pepsin and peptidase, and\nhydrochloric acid break down proteins. Lipases break down lipids. These broken down macromolecules\nprovide energy for cellular activities.\n60\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/hydrolysis) to see visual representations of dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis.\n3.2 Carbohydrates\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of carbohydrates in cells and in the extracellular materials of animals and plants\n\u2022\nExplain carbohydrate classifications\n\u2022\nList common monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides\nMost people are familiar with carbohydrates, one type of macromolecule, especially when it comes to what we eat. To lose\nweight, some individuals adhere to \u201clow-carb\u201d diets. Athletes, in contrast, often \u201ccarb-load\u201d before important competitions to\nensure that they have enough energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our diet. Grains,\nfruits, and vegetables are all natural carbohydrate sources that provide energy to the body, particularly through glucose, a simple\nsugar that is a component of starch and an ingredient in many staple foods. Carbohydrates also have other important functions\nin humans, animals, and plants.\nMolecular Structures\nThe stoichiometric formula (CH2O)n, where n is the number of carbons in the molecule represents carbohydrates. In other\nwords, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. This formula also explains the origin of the\nterm \u201ccarbohydrate\u201d: the components are carbon (\u201ccarbo\u201d) and the components of water (hence, \u201chydrate\u201d). Scientists classify\ncarbohydrates into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.\nMonosaccharides\nMonosaccharides (mono- = \u201cone\u201d; sacchar- = \u201csweet\u201d) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. In\nmonosaccharides, the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven. Most monosaccharide names end with the suffix\n-ose. If the sugar has an aldehyde group (the functional group with the structure R-CHO), it is an aldose, and if it has a ketone\ngroup (the functional group with the structure RC(=O)R'), it is a ketose. Depending on the number of carbons in the sugar, they\ncan be trioses (three carbons), pentoses (five carbons), and/or hexoses (six carbons). Figure 3.4 illustrates monosaccharides.\n3.2 \u2022 Carbohydrates\n61\nFigure 3.4 Scientists classify monosaccharides based on the position of their carbonyl group and the number of carbons in the backbone.\nAldoses have a carbonyl group (indicated in green) at the end of the carbon chain, and ketoses have a carbonyl group in the middle of the\ncarbon chain. Trioses, pentoses, and hexoses have three-, five-, and six- carbon backbones, respectively.\nThe chemical formula for glucose is C6H12O6. In humans, glucose is an important source of energy. During cellular respiration,\nenergy releases from glucose, and that energy helps make adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Plants synthesize glucose using carbon\ndioxide and water, and glucose in turn provides energy requirements for the plant. Humans and other animals that feed on\nplants often store excess glucose as catabolized (cell breakdown of larger molecules) starch.\nGalactose (part of lactose, or milk sugar) and fructose (found in sucrose, in fruit) are other common monosaccharides. Although\nglucose, galactose, and fructose all have the same chemical formula (C6H12O6), they differ structurally and chemically (and are\nisomers) because of the different arrangement of functional groups around the asymmetric carbon. All these monosaccharides\nhave more than one asymmetric carbon (Figure 3.5).\n62\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 3.5 Glucose, galactose, and fructose are all hexoses. They are structural isomers, meaning they have the same chemical formula\n(C6H12O6) but a different atom arrangement.\nWhat kind of sugars are these, aldose or ketose?\nGlucose, galactose, and fructose are isomeric monosaccharides (hexoses), meaning they have the same chemical formula but\nhave slightly different structures. Glucose and galactose are aldoses, and fructose is a ketose.\nMonosaccharides can exist as a linear chain or as ring-shaped molecules. In aqueous solutions they are usually in ring forms\n(Figure 3.6). Glucose in a ring form can have two different hydroxyl group arrangements (OH) around the anomeric carbon\n(carbon 1 that becomes asymmetric in the ring formation process). If the hydroxyl group is below carbon number 1 in the sugar,\nit is in the alpha (\u03b1) position, and if it is above the plane, it is in the beta (\u03b2) position.\n3.2 \u2022 Carbohydrates\n63\nFigure 3.6 Five and six carbon monosaccharides exist in equilibrium between linear and ring forms. When the ring forms, the side chain it\ncloses on locks into an \u03b1 or \u03b2 position. Fructose and ribose also form rings, although they form five-membered rings as opposed to the six-\nmembered ring of glucose.\nDisaccharides\nDisaccharides (di- = \u201ctwo\u201d) form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction (or a condensation reaction or\ndehydration synthesis). During this process, one monosaccharide's hydroxyl group combines with another monosaccharide's\nhydrogen, releasing a water molecule and forming a covalent bond. A covalent bond forms between a carbohydrate molecule and\nanother molecule (in this case, between two monosaccharides). Scientists call this a glycosidic bond (Figure 3.7). Glycosidic\nbonds (or glycosidic linkages) can be an alpha or beta type. An alpha bond is formed when the OH group on the carbon-1 of the\nfirst glucose is below the ring plane, and a beta bond is formed when the OH group on the carbon-1 is above the ring plane.\n64\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 3.7 Sucrose forms when a glucose monomer and a fructose monomer join in a dehydration reaction to form a glycosidic bond. In the\nprocess, a water molecule is lost. By convention, the carbon atoms in a monosaccharide are numbered from the terminal carbon closest to\nthe carbonyl group. In sucrose, a glycosidic linkage forms between carbon 1 in glucose and carbon 2 in fructose.\nCommon disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose (Figure 3.8). Lactose is a disaccharide consisting of the monomers\nglucose and galactose. It is naturally in milk. Maltose, or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed by a dehydration reaction between\ntwo glucose molecules. The most common disaccharide is sucrose, or table sugar, which is comprised of glucose and fructose\nmonomers.\n3.2 \u2022 Carbohydrates\n65\nFigure 3.8 Common disaccharides include maltose (grain sugar), lactose (milk sugar), and sucrose (table sugar).\nPolysaccharides\nA long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is a polysaccharide (poly- = \u201cmany\u201d). The chain may be branched or\nunbranched, and it may contain different types of monosaccharides. The molecular weight may be 100,000 daltons or more\ndepending on the number of joined monomers. Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are primary examples of polysaccharides.\nPlants store starch in the form of sugars. In plants, an amylose and amylopectic mixture (both glucose polymers) comprise these\nsugars. Plants are able to synthesize glucose, and they store the excess glucose, beyond their immediate energy needs, as starch\nin different plant parts, including roots and seeds. The starch in the seeds provides food for the embryo as it germinates and can\nalso act as a food source for humans and animals. Enzymes break down the starch that humans consume. For example, an\namylase present in saliva catalyzes, or breaks down this starch into smaller molecules, such as maltose and glucose. The cells can\nthen absorb the glucose.\nGlucose starch comprises monomers that are joined by \u03b1 1-4 or \u03b1 1-6 glycosidic bonds. The numbers 1-4 and 1-6 refer to the\ncarbon number of the two residues that have joined to form the bond. As Figure 3.9 illustrates, unbranched glucose monomer\nchains (only \u03b1 1-4 linkages) form the starch; whereas, amylopectin is a branched polysaccharide (\u03b1 1-6 linkages at the branch\npoints).\n66\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 3.9 Amylose and amylopectin are two different starch forms. Unbranched glucose monomer chains comprise amylose by \u03b1 1-4\nglycosidic linkages. Unbranched glucose monomer chains comprise amylopectin by \u03b1 1-4 and \u03b1 1-6 glycosidic linkages. Because of the\nway the subunits are joined, the glucose chains have a helical structure. Glycogen (not shown) is similar in structure to amylopectin but\nmore highly branched.\nGlycogen is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates and is comprised of monomers of glucose. Glycogen is\nthe animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells. Whenever blood\nglucose levels decrease, glycogen breaks down to release glucose in a process scientists call glycogenolysis.\nCellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer. Cellulose mostly comprises a plant's cell wall. This provides the cell\nstructural support. Wood and paper are mostly cellulosic in nature. Glucose monomers comprise cellulose that \u03b2 1-4 glycosidic\nbonds link (Figure 3.10).\n3.2 \u2022 Carbohydrates\n67\nFigure 3.10 In cellulose, glucose monomers are linked in unbranched chains by \u03b2 1-4 glycosidic linkages. Because of the way the glucose\nsubunits are joined, every glucose monomer is flipped relative to the next one resulting in a linear, fibrous structure.\nAs Figure 3.10 shows, every other glucose monomer in cellulose is flipped over, and the monomers are packed tightly as\nextended long chains. This gives cellulose its rigidity and high tensile strength\u2014which is so important to plant cells. While\nhuman digestive enzymes cannot break down the \u03b2 1-4 linkage, herbivores such as cows, koalas, and buffalos are able, with the\nhelp of the specialized flora in their stomach, to digest plant material that is rich in cellulose and use it as a food source. In some\nof these animals, certain species of bacteria and protists reside in the rumen (part of the herbivore's digestive system) and\nsecrete the enzyme cellulase. The appendix of grazing animals also contains bacteria that digest cellulose, giving it an important\nrole in ruminants' digestive systems. Cellulases can break down cellulose into glucose monomers that animals use as an energy\nsource. Termites are also able to break down cellulose because of the presence of other organisms in their bodies that secrete\ncellulases.\nCarbohydrates serve various functions in different animals. Arthropods (insects, crustaceans, and others) have an outer\nskeleton, the exoskeleton, which protects their internal body parts (as we see in the bee in Figure 3.11). This exoskeleton is made\nof the biological macromolecule chitin, which is a polysaccharide-containing nitrogen. It is made of repeating N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-\nglucosamine units, which are a modified sugar. Chitin is also a major component of fungal cell walls. Fungi are neither animals\nnor plants and form a kingdom of their own in the domain Eukarya.\nFigure 3.11 Insects have a hard outer exoskeleton made of chitin, a type of polysaccharide.

This is one of the reasons why people increasingly seek out registered dietitians for advice. Registered\ndietitians help plan nutrition programs for individuals in various settings. They often work with patients in health care facilities,\ndesigning nutrition plans to treat and prevent diseases. For example, dietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to\nmanage blood sugar levels by eating the correct types and amounts of carbohydrates. Dietitians may also work in nursing\nhomes, schools, and private practices.\nTo become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in dietetics, nutrition, food technology, or a\nrelated field. In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship program and pass a national exam. Those\nwho pursue careers in dietetics take courses in nutrition, chemistry, biochemistry, biology, microbiology, and human\nphysiology. Dietitians must become experts in the chemistry and physiology (biological functions) of food (proteins,\ncarbohydrates, and fats).\nBenefits of Carbohydrates\nAre carbohydrates good for you? Some people believe that carbohydrates are bad and they should avoid them. Some diets\ncompletely forbid carbohydrate consumption, claiming that a low-carbohydrate diet helps people to lose weight faster. However,\ncarbohydrates have been an important part of the human diet for thousands of years. Artifacts from ancient civilizations show\nthe presence of wheat, rice, and corn in our ancestors\u2019 storage areas.\nAs part of a well balanced diet, we should supplement carbohydrates with proteins, vitamins, and fats. Calorie-wise, a gram of\ncarbohydrate provides 4.3 Kcal. For comparison, fats provide 9 Kcal/g, a less desirable ratio. Carbohydrates contain soluble and\ninsoluble elements. The insoluble part, fiber, is mostly cellulose. Fiber has many uses. It promotes regular bowel movement by\nadding bulk, and it regulates the blood glucose consumption rate. Fiber also helps to remove excess cholesterol from the body.\nFiber binds to the cholesterol in the small intestine, then attaches to the cholesterol and prevents the cholesterol particles from\nentering the bloodstream. Cholesterol then exits the body via the feces. Fiber-rich diets also have a protective role in reducing\nthe occurrence of colon cancer. In addition, a meal containing whole grains and vegetables gives a feeling of fullness. As an\nimmediate source of energy, glucose breaks down during the cellular respiration process, which produces ATP, the cell's energy\ncurrency. Without consuming carbohydrates, we reduce the availability of \u201cinstant energy\u201d. Eliminating carbohydrates from the\ndiet may be necessary for some people, but such a step may not be healthy for everyone.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor an additional perspective on carbohydrates, explore \u201cBiomolecules: the Carbohydrates\u201d through this interactive animation\n(http://openstax.org/l/carbohydrates) .\n3.3 Lipids\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the four major types of lipids\n\u2022\nExplain the role of fats in storing energy\n\u2022\nDifferentiate between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids\n\u2022\nDescribe phospholipids and their role in cells\n\u2022\nDefine the basic structure of a steroid and some steroid functions\n\u2022\nExplain how cholesterol helps maintain the plasma membrane's fluid nature\nLipids include a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature. This is because they are hydrocarbons that\ninclude mostly nonpolar carbon\u2013carbon or carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds. Non-polar molecules are hydrophobic (\u201cwater fearing\u201d), or\ninsoluble in water. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of fats.\nLipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals (Figure 3.12). For example, they help keep aquatic\nbirds and mammals dry when forming a protective layer over fur or feathers because of their water-repellant hydrophobic\n3.3 \u2022 Lipids\n69\nnature. Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and are an important constituent of all cellular membranes. Lipids\ninclude fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.\nFigure 3.12 Hydrophobic lipids in aquatic mammals' fur, such as this river otter, protect them from the elements. (credit: Ken Bosma)\nFats and Oils\nA fat molecule consists of two main components\u2014glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an organic compound (alcohol) with three\ncarbons, five hydrogens, and three hydroxyl (OH) groups. Fatty acids have a long chain of hydrocarbons to which a carboxyl\ngroup is attached, hence the name \u201cfatty acid.\u201d The number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36. The most\ncommon are those containing 12\u201318 carbons. In a fat molecule, the fatty acids attach to each of the glycerol molecule's three\ncarbons with an ester bond through an oxygen atom (Figure 3.13).\n70\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 3.13 Joining three fatty acids to a glycerol backbone in a dehydration reaction forms triacylglycerol. Three water molecules release\nin the process.\nDuring this ester bond formation, three water molecules are released. The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar\nor dissimilar. We also call fats triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure. Some fatty acids have\ncommon names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree.\nArachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts.\nFatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in\nthe hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen. In other words, the\nnumber of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. Stearic acid is an example of a saturated fatty acid\n(Figure 3.14).\n3.3 \u2022 Lipids\n71\nFigure 3.14 Stearic acid is a common saturated fatty acid.\nWhen the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond, the fatty acid is unsaturated. Oleic acid is an example of an unsaturated\nfatty acid (Figure 3.15).\nFigure 3.15 Oleic acid is a common unsaturated fatty acid.\nMost unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature. We call these oils. If there is one double bond in the molecule, then it is a\nmonounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then it is a polyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil).\nWhen a fatty acid has no double bonds, it is a saturated fatty acid because it is not possible to add more hydrogen to the chain's\ncarbon atoms. A fat may contain similar or different fatty acids attached to glycerol. Long straight fatty acids with single bonds\ngenerally pack tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic acid and palmitic acid (common in meat) and\nthe fat with butyric acid (common in butter) are examples of saturated fats. Mammals store fats in specialized cells, or\nadipocytes, where fat globules occupy most of the cell\u2019s volume. Plants store fat or oil in many seeds and use them as a source of\nenergy during seedling development. Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain cis unsaturated fatty acids.\nCis and trans indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond. If hydrogens are present in the same plane, it\nis a cis fat. If the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes, it is a trans fat. The cis double bond causes a bend or a \u201ckink\u201d that\nprevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature (Figure 3.16). Olive oil, corn oil, canola\noil, and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats help to lower blood cholesterol levels; whereas, saturated\nfats contribute to plaque formation in the arteries.\n72\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 3.16 Saturated fatty acids have hydrocarbon chains connected by single bonds only. Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more\ndouble bonds. Each double bond may be in a cis or trans configuration. In the cis configuration, both hydrogens are on the same side of the\nhydrocarbon chain. In the trans configuration, the hydrogens are on opposite sides. A cis double bond causes a kink in the chain.\nTrans Fats\nThe food industry artificially hydrogenates oils to make them semi-solid and of a consistency desirable for many processed food\nproducts. Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. During this hydrogenation process, double\nbonds of the cis- conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may convert to double bonds in the trans- conformation.\nMargarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenated trans fats. Recent studies have\nshown that an increase in trans fats in the human diet may lead to higher levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or \u201cbad\u201d\ncholesterol, which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in heart disease. Many fast food restaurants\nhave recently banned using trans fats, and food labels are required to display the trans fat content.\nOmega Fatty Acids\nEssential fatty acids are those that the human body requires but does not synthesize. Consequently, they have to be\nsupplemented through ingestion via the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids (like those in Figure 3.17) fall into this category and are one of\nonly two known for humans (the other is omega-6 fatty acid). These are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are omega-3 because a\ndouble bond connects the third carbon from the hydrocarbon chain's end to its neighboring carbon.\n3.3 \u2022 Lipids\n73\nFigure 3.17 Alpha-linolenic acid is an example of an omega-3 fatty acid. It has three cis double bonds and, as a result, a curved shape. For\nclarity, the diagram does not show the carbons. Each singly bonded carbon has two hydrogens associated with it, which the diagram also\ndoes not show.\nThe farthest carbon away from the carboxyl group is numbered as the omega (\u03c9) carbon, and if the double bond is between the\nthird and fourth carbon from that end, it is an omega-3 fatty acid. Nutritionally important because the body does not make\nthem, omega-3 fatty acids include alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), all\nof which are polyunsaturated. Salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Research indicates that omega-3\nfatty acids reduce the risk of sudden death from heart attacks, lower triglycerides in the blood, decrease blood pressure, and\nprevent thrombosis by inhibiting blood clotting. They also reduce inflammation, and may help lower the risk of some cancers in\nanimals.\nLike carbohydrates, fats have received considerable bad publicity. It is true that eating an excess of fried foods and other \u201cfatty\u201d\nfoods leads to weight gain. However, fats do have important functions. Many vitamins are fat soluble, and fats serve as a long-\nterm storage form of fatty acids: a source of energy. They also provide insulation for the body. Therefore, we should consume\n\u201chealthy\u201d fats in moderate amounts on a regular basis.\nWaxes\nWax covers some aquatic birds' feathers and some plants' leaf surfaces. Because of waxes' hydrophobic nature, they prevent\nwater from sticking on the surface (Figure 3.18). Long fatty acid chains esterified to long-chain alcohols comprise waxes.\nFigure 3.18 Lipids comprise waxy coverings on some leaves. (credit: Roger Griffith)\nPhospholipids\nPhospholipids are major plasma membrane constituents that comprise cells' outermost layer. Like fats, they are comprised of\nfatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone. However, instead of three fatty acids attached as in\n74\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ntriglycerides, there are two fatty acids forming diacylglycerol, and a modified phosphate group occupies the glycerol backbone's\nthird carbon (Figure 3.19). A phosphate group alone attached to a diacylglycerol does not qualify as a phospholipid. It is\nphosphatidate (diacylglycerol 3-phosphate), the precursor of phospholipids. An alcohol modifies the phosphate group.\nPhosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine are two important phospholipids that are in plasma membranes.\nFigure 3.19 A phospholipid is a molecule with two fatty acids and a modified phosphate group attached to a glycerol backbone. Adding a\ncharged or polar chemical group may modify the phosphate.\nA phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part. The fatty acid chains are\nhydrophobic and cannot interact with water; whereas, the phosphate-containing group is hydrophilic and interacts with water\n(Figure 3.20).\nFigure 3.20 The phospholipid bilayer is the major component of all cellular membranes. The hydrophilic head groups of the phospholipids\nface the aqueous solution. The hydrophobic tails are sequestered in the middle of the bilayer.\nThe head is the hydrophilic part, and the tail contains the hydrophobic fatty acids. In a membrane, a bilayer of phospholipids\nforms the structure's matrix, phospholipids' fatty acid tails face inside, away from water; whereas, the phosphate group faces\nthe outside, aqueous side (Figure 3.20).\nPhospholipids are responsible for the plasma membrane's dynamic nature. If a drop of phospholipids is placed in water, it\nspontaneously forms a structure that scientists call a micelle, where the hydrophilic phosphate heads face the outside and the\nfatty acids face the structure's interior.\n3.3 \u2022 Lipids\n75\nSteroids\nUnlike the phospholipids and fats that we discussed earlier, steroids have a fused ring structure. Although they do not resemble\nthe other lipids, scientists group them with them because they are also hydrophobic and insoluble in water. All steroids have\nfour linked carbon rings and several of them, like cholesterol, have a short tail (Figure 3.21). Many steroids also have the \u2013OH\nfunctional group, which puts them in the alcohol classification (sterols).\nFigure 3.21 Four fused hydrocarbon rings comprise steroids such as cholesterol and cortisol.\nCholesterol is the most common steroid. The liver synthesizes cholesterol and is the precursor to many steroid hormones such\nas testosterone and estradiol, which gonads and endocrine glands secrete. It is also the precursor to Vitamin D. Cholesterol is\nalso the precursor of bile salts, which help emulsifying fats and their subsequent absorption by cells. Although lay people often\nspeak negatively about cholesterol, it is necessary for the body's proper functioning. Sterols (cholesterol in animal cells,\nphytosterol in plants) are components of the plasma membrane of cells and are found within the phospholipid bilayer.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor an additional perspective on lipids, explore the interactive animation \u201cBiomolecules: The Lipids\u201d (http://openstax.org/l/\nlipids) .\n3.4 Proteins\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the functions proteins perform in the cell and in tissues\n\u2022\nDiscuss the relationship between amino acids and proteins\n\u2022\nExplain the four levels of protein organization\n\u2022\nDescribe the ways in which protein shape and function are linked\nProteins are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of functions of all\nmacromolecules. Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective. They may serve in transport, storage, or\nmembranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes. Each cell in a living system may contain thousands of proteins, each with a\nunique function. Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. They are all, however, amino acid polymers arranged in a\nlinear sequence.\n76\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nTypes and Functions of Proteins\nEnzymes, which living cells produce, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex or\nconjugated proteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) upon which it acts. The\nenzyme may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions. We call enzymes that break down their substrates\ncatabolic enzymes. Those that build more complex molecules from their substrates are anabolic enzymes, and enzymes that\naffect the rate of reaction are catalytic enzymes. Note that all enzymes increase the reaction rate and, therefore, are organic\ncatalysts. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its substrate amylose, a component of starch.\nHormones are chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or\nregulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. For example, insulin\nis a protein hormone that helps regulate the blood glucose level. Table 3.1 lists the primary types and functions of proteins.\nProtein Types and Functions\nType\nExamples\nFunctions\nDigestive\nEnzymes\nAmylase, lipase, pepsin, trypsin\nHelp in food by catabolizing nutrients into monomeric\nunits\nTransport\nHemoglobin, albumin\nCarry substances in the blood or lymph throughout the body\nStructural\nActin, tubulin, keratin\nConstruct different structures, like the cytoskeleton\nHormones\nInsulin, thyroxine\nCoordinate different body systems' activity\nDefense\nImmunoglobulins\nProtect the body from foreign pathogens\nContractile\nActin, myosin\nEffect muscle contraction\nStorage\nLegume storage proteins, egg white\n(albumin)\nProvide nourishment in early embryo development and the\nseedling\nTable 3.1\nProteins have different shapes and molecular weights. Some proteins are globular in shape; whereas, others are fibrous in\nnature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, located in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is\ncritical to its function, and many different types of chemical bonds maintain this shape. Changes in temperature, pH, and\nexposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the protein's shape, leading to loss of function, or denaturation.\nDifferent arrangements of the same 20 types of amino acids comprise all proteins. Two rare new amino acids were discovered\nrecently (selenocystein and pirrolysine), and additional new discoveries may be added to the list.\nAmino Acids\nAmino acids are the monomers that comprise proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which consists of\na central carbon atom, or the alpha (\u03b1) carbon, bonded to an amino group (NH2), a carboxyl group (COOH), and to a hydrogen\natom. Every amino acid also has another atom or group of atoms bonded to the central atom known as the R group (Figure 3.22).\n3.4 \u2022 Proteins\n77\nFigure 3.22 Amino acids have a central asymmetric carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a side chain\n(R group) are attached.\nScientists use the name \"amino acid\" because these acids contain both amino group and carboxyl-acid-group in their basic\nstructure. As we mentioned, there are 20 common amino acids present in proteins. Nine of these are essential amino acids in\nhumans because the human body cannot produce them and we obtain them from our diet. For each amino acid, the R group (or\nside chain) is different (Figure 3.23).\n78\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 3.23 There are 20 common amino acids commonly found in proteins, each with a different R group (variant group) that determines\nits chemical nature.\nWhich categories of amino acid would you expect to find on a soluble protein's surface and which would you expect to find in the\ninterior? What distribution of amino acids would you expect to find in a protein embedded in a lipid bilayer?\nThe chemical nature of the side chain determines the amino acid's nature (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar).\nFor example, the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the R group. Amino acids such as valine, methionine, and alanine\nare nonpolar or hydrophobic in nature, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine are polar and have hydrophilic\nside chains. The side chains of lysine and arginine are positively charged, and therefore these amino acids are also basic amino\nacids. Proline has an R group that is linked to the amino group, forming a ring-like structure. Proline is an exception to the\namino acid's standard structure since its amino group is not separate from the side chain (Figure 3.23).\nA single upper case letter or a three-letter abbreviation represents amino acids. For example, the letter V or the three-letter\nsymbol val represent valine. Just as some fatty acids are essential to a diet, some amino acids also are necessary. These essential\namino acids in humans include isoleucine, leucine, and cysteine. Essential amino acids refer to those necessary to build proteins\nin the body, but not those that the body produces. Which amino acids are essential varies from organism to organism.\nThe sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein's shape, size, and function. A covalent bond, or\npeptide bond, attaches to each amino acid, which a dehydration reaction forms. One amino acid's carboxyl group and the\nincoming amino acid's amino group combine, releasing a water molecule. The resulting bond is the peptide bond (Figure 3.24).\n3.4 \u2022 Proteins\n79\nFigure 3.24 Peptide bond formation is a dehydration synthesis reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid is linked to the incoming\namino acid's amino group. In the process, it releases a water molecule.\nThe products that such linkages form are peptides. As more amino acids join to this growing chain, the resulting chain is a\npolypeptide. Each polypeptide has a free amino group at one end. This end the N terminal, or the amino terminal, and the other\nend has a free carboxyl group, also the C or carboxyl terminal. While the terms polypeptide and protein are sometimes used\ninterchangeably, a polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids, whereas the term protein is used for a polypeptide or\npolypeptides that have combined together, often have bound non-peptide prosthetic groups, have a distinct shape, and have a\nunique function. After protein synthesis (translation), most proteins are modified. These are known as post-translational\nmodifications. They may undergo cleavage, phosphorylation, or may require adding other chemical groups. Only after these\nmodifications is the protein completely functional.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick through the steps of protein synthesis in this interactive tutorial (http://openstax.org/l/protein_synth) .\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThe Evolutionary Significance of Cytochrome c\nCytochrome c is an important component of the electron transport chain, a part of cellular respiration, and it is normally\nlocated in the cellular organelle, the mitochondrion. This protein has a heme prosthetic group, and the heme's central ion\nalternately reduces and oxidizes during electron transfer. Because this essential protein\u2019s role in producing cellular energy is\ncrucial, it has changed very little over millions of years. Protein sequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of\ncytochrome c amino acid sequence homology among different species. In other words, we can assess evolutionary kinship by\nmeasuring the similarities or differences among various species\u2019 DNA or protein sequences.\nScientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino acids. For each cytochrome c molecule from different\norganisms that scientists have sequenced to date, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same position in all cytochrome c\nsamples. This indicates that there may have been a common ancestor. On comparing the human and chimpanzee protein\nsequences, scientists did not find a sequence difference. When researchers compared human and rhesus monkey sequences, the\nsingle difference was in one amino acid. In another comparison, human to yeast sequencing shows a difference in the 44th\nposition.\nProtein Structure\nAs we discussed earlier, a protein's shape is critical to its function. For example, an enzyme can bind to a specific substrate at an\nactive site. If this active site is altered because of local changes or changes in overall protein structure, the enzyme may be\nunable to bind to the substrate. To understand how the protein gets its final shape or conformation, we need to understand the\nfour levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.\n80\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nPrimary Structure\nAmino acids' unique sequence in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. For example, the pancreatic hormone insulin has\ntwo polypeptide chains, A and B, and they are linked together by disulfide bonds. The N terminal amino acid of the A chain is\nglycine; whereas, the C terminal amino acid is asparagine (Figure 3.25). The amino acid sequences in the A and B chains are\nunique to insulin.\nFigure 3.25 Bovine serum insulin is a protein hormone comprised of two peptide chains, A (21 amino acids long) and B (30 amino acids\nlong). In each chain, three-letter abbreviations that represent the amino acids' names in the order they are present indicate primary\nstructure. The amino acid cysteine (cys) has a sulfhydryl (SH) group as a side chain. Two sulfhydryl groups can react in the presence of\noxygen to form a disulfide (S-S) bond. Two disulfide bonds connect the A and B chains together, and a third helps the A chain fold into the\ncorrect shape. Note that all disulfide bonds are the same length, but we have drawn them different sizes for clarity.\nThe gene encoding the protein ultimately determines the unique sequence for every protein. A change in nucleotide sequence of\nthe gene\u2019s coding region may lead to adding a different amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain, causing a change in\nprotein structure and function. In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin \u03b2 chain (a small portion of which we show in Figure 3.26)\nhas a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in protein structure and function. Specifically, valine in the \u03b2 chain\nsubstitutes the amino acid glutamic. What is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is comprised of two\nalpha and two beta chains that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The\nstructural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule\u2014which dramatically decreases life\nexpectancy\u2014is a single amino acid of the 600. What is even more remarkable is that three nucleotides each encode those 600\namino acids, and a single base change (point mutation), 1 in 1800 bases causes the mutation.\nFigure 3.26 The beta chain of hemoglobin is 147 residues in length, yet a single amino acid substitution leads to sickle cell anemia. In\nnormal hemoglobin, the amino acid at position seven is glutamate. In sickle cell hemoglobin, a valine replaces glutamate.\nBecause of this change of one amino acid in the chain, hemoglobin molecules form long fibers that distort the biconcave, or\ndisc-shaped, red blood cells and causes them to assume a crescent or \u201csickle\u201d shape, which clogs blood vessels (Figure 3.27). This\n3.4 \u2022 Proteins\n81\ncan lead to myriad serious health problems such as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for those affected\nby this disease.\nFigure 3.27 In this blood smear, visualized at 535x magnification using bright field microscopy, sickle cells are crescent shaped, while\nnormal cells are disc-shaped. (credit: modification of work by Ed Uthman; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nSecondary Structure\nThe local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein. The most common are\nthe \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-pleated sheet structures (Figure 3.28). Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen\nbonds form between the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group in one amino acid and another amino acid that is four amino acids\nfarther along the chain.\nFigure 3.28 The \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-pleated sheet are secondary structures of proteins that form because of hydrogen bonding between\ncarbonyl and amino groups in the peptide backbone. Certain amino acids have a propensity to form an \u03b1-helix, while others have a\npropensity to form a \u03b2-pleated sheet.\nEvery helical turn in an alpha helix has 3.6 amino acid residues. The polypeptide's R groups (the variant groups) protrude out\nfrom the \u03b1-helix chain. In the \u03b2-pleated sheet, hydrogen bonding between atoms on the polypeptide chain's backbone form the\n\"pleats\". The R groups are attached to the carbons and extend above and below the pleat's folds. The pleated segments align\nparallel or antiparallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the partially positive nitrogen atom in the amino group\nand the partially negative oxygen atom in the peptide backbone's carbonyl group. The \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-pleated sheet structures are\nin most globular and fibrous proteins and they play an important structural role.\n82\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nTertiary Structure\nThe polypeptide's unique three-dimensional structure is its tertiary structure (Figure 3.29). This structure is in part due to\nchemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain. Primarily, the interactions among R groups create the protein's complex\nthree-dimensional tertiary structure. The nature of the R groups in the amino acids involved can counteract forming the\nhydrogen bonds we described for standard secondary structures. For example, R groups with like charges repel each other and\nthose with unlike charges are attracted to each other (ionic bonds). When protein folding takes place, the nonpolar amino acids'\nhydrophobic R groups lie in the protein's interior; whereas, the hydrophilic R groups lie on the outside. Scientists also call the\nformer interaction types hydrophobic interactions. Interaction between cysteine side chains forms disulfide linkages in the\npresence of oxygen, the only covalent bond that forms during protein folding.\nFigure 3.29 A variety of chemical interactions determine the proteins' tertiary structure. These include hydrophobic interactions, ionic\nbonding, hydrogen bonding, and disulfide linkages.\nAll of these interactions, weak and strong, determine the protein's final three-dimensional shape. When a protein loses its\nthree-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional.\nQuaternary Structure\nIn nature, some proteins form from several polypeptides, or subunits, and the interaction of these subunits forms the\nquaternary structure. Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure. For example, insulin (a\nglobular protein) has a combination of hydrogen and disulfide bonds that cause it to mostly clump into a ball shape. Insulin\nstarts out as a single polypeptide and loses some internal sequences in the presence of post-translational modification after\nforming the disulfide linkages that hold the remaining chains together. Silk (a fibrous protein), however, has a \u03b2-pleated sheet\nstructure that is the result of hydrogen bonding between different chains.\nFigure 3.30 illustrates the four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary).\n3.4 \u2022 Proteins\n83\nFigure 3.30 Observe the four levels of protein structure in these illustrations. (credit: modification of work by National Human Genome\nResearch Institute)\nDenaturation and Protein Folding\nEach protein has its own unique sequence and shape that chemical interactions hold together. If the protein is subject to\nchanges in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape without losing its\nprimary sequence in what scientists call denaturation. Denaturation is often reversible because the polypeptide's primary\nstructure is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. Sometimes\ndenaturation is irreversible, leading to loss of function. One example of irreversible protein denaturation is frying an egg. The\nalbumin protein in the liquid egg white denatures when placed in a hot pan. Not all proteins denature at high temperatures. For\ninstance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at temperatures close to boiling. The stomach is also\nvery acidic, has a low pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process; however, the stomach's digestive enzymes\nretain their activity under these conditions.\nProtein folding is critical to its function. Scientists originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the\nfolding process. Only recently researchers discovered that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein\nhelpers, or chaperones (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding process. They act by preventing\n84\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\npolypeptide aggregation that comprise the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein once the target\nprotein is folded.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor an additional perspective on proteins, view this animation (http://openstax.org/l/proteins) called \u201cBiomolecules: The\nProteins.\u201d\n3.5 Nucleic Acids\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe nucleic acids' structure and define the two types of nucleic acids\n\u2022\nExplain DNA's structure and role\n\u2022\nExplain RNA's structure and roles\nNucleic acids are the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life.

It is in the nucleus of eukaryotes and in the\norganelles, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. In prokaryotes, the DNA is not enclosed in a membranous envelope.\nThe cell's entire genetic content is its genome, and the study of genomes is genomics. In eukaryotic cells but not in prokaryotes,\nDNA forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chromosomes. A chromosome may\ncontain tens of thousands of genes. Many genes contain the information to make protein products. Other genes code for RNA\nproducts. DNA controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes \u201con\u201d or \u201coff.\u201d\nThe other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus but\ninstead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. This intermediary is the messenger RNA (mRNA). Other\ntypes of RNA\u2014like rRNA, tRNA, and microRNA\u2014are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.\nDNA and RNA are comprised of monomers that scientists call nucleotides. The nucleotides combine with each other to form a\npolynucleotide, DNA or RNA. Three components comprise each nucleotide: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-carbon) sugar,\nand a phosphate group (Figure 3.31). Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule, which is attached to\none or more phosphate groups.\n3.5 \u2022 Nucleic Acids\n85\nFigure 3.31 Three components comprise a nucleotide: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups. Carbon\nresidues in the pentose are numbered 1\u2032 through 5\u2032 (the prime distinguishes these residues from those in the base, which are numbered\nwithout using a prime notation). The base is attached to the ribose's 1\u2032 position, and the phosphate is attached to the 5\u2032 position. When a\npolynucleotide forms, the incoming nucleotide's 5\u2032 phosphate attaches to the 3\u2032 hydroxyl group at the end of the growing chain. Two types\nof pentose are in nucleotides, deoxyribose (found in DNA) and ribose (found in RNA). Deoxyribose is similar in structure to ribose, but it has\nan H instead of an OH at the 2\u2032 position. We can divide bases into two categories: purines and pyrimidines. Purines have a double ring\nstructure, and pyrimidines have a single ring.\nThe nitrogenous bases, important components of nucleotides, are organic molecules and are so named because they contain\ncarbon and nitrogen. They are bases because they contain an amino group that has the potential of binding an extra hydrogen,\nand thus decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration in its environment, making it more basic. Each nucleotide in DNA contains\none of four possible nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G) cytosine (C), and thymine (T).\nScientists classify adenine and guanine as purines. The purine's primary structure is two carbon-nitrogen rings. Scientists\nclassify cytosine, thymine, and uracil as pyrimidines which have a single carbon-nitrogen ring as their primary structure\n(Figure 3.31). Each of these basic carbon-nitrogen rings has different functional groups attached to it. In molecular biology\nshorthand, we know the nitrogenous bases by their symbols A, T, G, C, and U. DNA contains A, T, G, and C; whereas, RNA\ncontains A, U, G, and C.\n86\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe pentose sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, and in RNA, the sugar is ribose (Figure 3.31). The difference between the sugars is the\npresence of the hydroxyl group on the ribose's second carbon and hydrogen on the deoxyribose's second carbon. The carbon\natoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1\u2032, 2\u2032, 3\u2032, 4\u2032, and 5\u2032 (1\u2032 is read as \u201cone prime\u201d). The phosphate residue attaches to the\nhydroxyl group of the 5\u2032 carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3\u2032 carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, which\nforms a 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 phosphodiester linkage. A simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in\nmacromolecules does not form the phosphodiester linkage. Its formation involves removing two phosphate groups. A\npolynucleotide may have thousands of such phosphodiester linkages.\nDNA Double-Helix Structure\nDNA has a double-helix structure (Figure 3.32). The sugar and phosphate lie on the outside of the helix, forming the DNA's\nbackbone. The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like a pair of staircase steps. Hydrogen bonds bind the pairs to each\nother. Every base pair in the double helix is separated from the next base pair by 0.34 nm. The helix's two strands run in opposite\ndirections, meaning that the 5\u2032 carbon end of one strand will face the 3\u2032 carbon end of its matching strand. (Scientists call this an\nantiparallel orientation and is important to DNA replication and in many nucleic acid interactions.)\nFigure 3.32 Native DNA is an antiparallel double helix. The phosphate backbone (indicated by the curvy lines) is on the outside, and the\nbases are on the inside. Each base from one strand interacts via hydrogen bonding with a base from the opposing strand. (credit: Jerome\nWalker/Dennis Myts)\nOnly certain types of base pairing are allowed. For example, a certain purine can only pair with a certain pyrimidine. This means\nA can pair with T, and G can pair with C, as Figure 3.33 shows. This is the base complementary rule. In other words, the DNA\nstrands are complementary to each other. If the sequence of one strand is AATTGGCC, the complementary strand would have\nthe sequence TTAACCGG. During DNA replication, each strand copies itself, resulting in a daughter DNA double helix\ncontaining one parental DNA strand and a newly synthesized strand.\n3.5 \u2022 Nucleic Acids\n87\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 3.33 In a double stranded DNA molecule, the two strands run antiparallel to one another so that one strand runs 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 and the\nother 3\u2032 to 5\u2032. The phosphate backbone is located on the outside, and the bases are in the middle. Adenine forms hydrogen bonds (or base\npairs) with thymine, and guanine base pairs with cytosine.\nA mutation occurs, and adenine replaces cytosine. What impact do you think this will have on the DNA structure?\nRNA\nRibonucleic acid, or RNA, is mainly involved in the process of protein synthesis under the direction of DNA. RNA is usually\nsingle-stranded and is comprised of ribonucleotides that are linked by phosphodiester bonds. A ribonucleotide in the RNA chain\ncontains ribose (the pentose sugar), one of the four nitrogenous bases (A, U, G, and C), and the phosphate group.\nThere are four major types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and microRNA\n(miRNA). The first, mRNA, carries the message from DNA, which controls all of the cellular activities in a cell. If a cell requires\nsynthesizing a certain protein, the gene for this product turns \u201con\u201d and the messenger RNA synthesizes in the nucleus. The RNA\nbase sequence is complementary to the DNA's coding sequence from which it has been copied. However, in RNA, the base T is\nabsent and U is present instead. If the DNA strand has a sequence AATTGCGC, the sequence of the complementary RNA is\nUUAACGCG. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA interacts with ribosomes and other cellular machinery (Figure 3.34).\nFigure 3.34 A ribosome has two parts: a large subunit and a small subunit. The mRNA sits in between the two subunits. A tRNA molecule\nrecognizes a codon on the mRNA, binds to it by complementary base pairing, and adds the correct amino acid to the growing peptide chain.\nThe mRNA is read in sets of three bases known as codons. Each codon codes for a single amino acid. In this way, the mRNA is\nread and the protein product is made. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mRNA binds.\nThe rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the Ribosomes. The ribosome's rRNA also has an enzymatic activity\n(peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes peptide bond formation between two aligned amino acids. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is one of\nthe smallest of the four types of RNA, usually 70\u201390 nucleotides long. It carries the correct amino acid to the protein synthesis\n88\nChapter 3 \u2022 Biological Macromolecules\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nsite. It is the base pairing between the tRNA and mRNA that allows for the correct amino acid to insert itself in the polypeptide\nchain. MicroRNAs are the smallest RNA molecules and their role involves regulating gene expression by interfering with the\nexpression of certain mRNA messages.

Macromolecules are comprised of single units\nscientists call monomers that are joined by covalent bonds to\nform larger polymers. The polymer is more than the sum of\nits parts: it acquires new characteristics, and leads to an\nosmotic pressure that is much lower than that formed by its\ningredients. This is an important advantage in maintaining\ncellular osmotic conditions. A monomer joins with another\nmonomer with water molecule release, leading to a covalent\nbond forming. Scientists call these dehydration or\ncondensation reactions. When polymers break down into\nsmaller units (monomers), they use a water molecule for\neach bond broken by these reactions. Such reactions are\nhydrolysis reactions. Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions\nare similar for all macromolecules, but each monomer and\npolymer reaction is specific to its class. Dehydration\nreactions typically require an investment of energy for new\nbond formation, while hydrolysis reactions typically release\nenergy by breaking bonds.\n3.2 Carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates are a group of macromolecules that are a vital\nenergy source for the cell and provide structural support to\nplant cells, fungi, and all of the arthropods that include\nlobsters, crabs, shrimp, insects, and spiders. Scientists\nclassify carbohydrates as monosaccharides, disaccharides,\nand polysaccharides depending on the number of monomers\nin the molecule. Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic\nbonds that form as a result of dehydration reactions,\nforming disaccharides and polysaccharides with eliminating\na water molecule for each bond formed. Glucose, galactose,\nand fructose are common monosaccharides; whereas,\ncommon disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and\nsucrose. Starch and glycogen, examples of polysaccharides,\nare the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals,\nrespectively. The long polysaccharide chains may be\nbranched or unbranched. Cellulose is an example of an\nunbranched polysaccharide; whereas, amylopectin, a\nconstituent of starch, is a highly branched molecule. Glucose\nstorage, in the form of polymers like starch of glycogen,\nmakes it slightly less accessible for metabolism; however, this\nprevents it from leaking out of the cell or creating a high\nosmotic pressure that could cause the cell to uptake excessive\nwater.\n3.3 Lipids\nLipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and\nhydrophobic in nature. Major types include fats and oils,\nwaxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats are a stored form of\nenergy and are also known as triacylglycerols or\ntriglycerides. Fats are comprised of fatty acids and either\nglycerol or sphingosine. Fatty acids may be unsaturated or\nsaturated, depending on the presence or absence of double\nbonds in the hydrocarbon chain. If only single bonds are\npresent, they are saturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty\nacids may have one or more double bonds in the hydrocarbon\nchain. Phospholipids comprise the membrane's matrix. They\nhave a glycerol or sphingosine backbone to which two fatty\nacid chains and a phosphate-containing group are attached.\nSteroids are another class of lipids. Their basic structure has\nfour fused carbon rings. Cholesterol is a type of steroid and\nis an important constituent of the plasma membrane, where\nit helps to maintain the membrane's fluid nature. It is also\nthe precursor of steroid hormones such as testosterone.\n3.4 Proteins\nProteins are a class of macromolecules that perform a\ndiverse range of functions for the cell. They help in\nmetabolism by acting as enzymes, carriers, or hormones,\nand provide structural support. The building blocks of\nproteins (monomers) are amino acids. Each amino acid has a\ncentral carbon that bonds to an amino group, a carboxyl\ngroup, a hydrogen atom, and an R group or side chain. There\nare 20 commonly occurring amino acids, each of which\ndiffers in the R group. A peptide bond links each amino acid\nChapter 3 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n91\nto its neighbors. A long amino acid chain is a polypeptide.\nProteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary,\ntertiary, and (optional) quaternary. The primary structure is\nthe amino acids' unique sequence. The polypeptide's local\nfolding to form structures such as the \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-pleated\nsheet constitutes the secondary structure. The overall three-\ndimensional structure is the tertiary structure. When two or\nmore polypeptides combine to form the complete protein\nstructure, the configuration is the protein's quaternary\nstructure. Protein shape and function are intricately linked.\nAny change in shape caused by changes in temperature or\npH may lead to protein denaturation and a loss in function.\n3.5 Nucleic Acids\nNucleic acids are molecules comprised of nucleotides that\ndirect cellular activities such as cell division and protein\nsynthesis. Pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a\nphosphate group comprise each nucleotide. There are two\ntypes of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA. DNA carries the cell's\ngenetic blueprint and passes it on from parents to offspring\n(in the form of chromosomes). It has a double-helical\nstructure with the two strands running in opposite\ndirections, connected by hydrogen bonds, and\ncomplementary to each other. RNA is a single-stranded\npolymer composed of linked nucleotides made up of a\npentose sugar (ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate\ngroup. RNA is involved in protein synthesis and its\nregulation. Messenger RNA (mRNA) copies from the DNA,\nexports itself from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and\ncontains information for constructing proteins. Ribosomal\nRNA (rRNA) is a part of the ribosomes at the site of protein\nsynthesis; whereas, transfer RNA (tRNA) carries the amino\nacid to the site of protein synthesis. The microRNA regulates\nusing mRNA for protein synthesis.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1. Figure 3.5 What kind of sugars are these, aldose or\nketose?\n2.

What is the wall's basic building block? It is a\nsingle brick. Like a brick wall, cells are the building blocks that make up your body.\nYour body has many kinds of cells, each specialized for a specific purpose. Just as we use a variety of\nmaterials to build a home, the human body is constructed from many cell types. For example, epithelial\ncells protect the body's surface and cover the organs and body cavities within. Bone cells help to support\nand protect the body. Immune system cells fight invading bacteria. Additionally, blood and blood cells\ncarry nutrients and oxygen throughout the body while removing carbon dioxide. Each of these cell types\nplays a vital role during the body's growth, development, and day-to-day maintenance. In spite of their\nenormous variety, however, cells from all organisms\u2014even ones as diverse as bacteria, onion, and\nhuman\u2014share certain fundamental characteristics.\nChapter Outline\n4.1 Studying Cells\n4.2 Prokaryotic Cells\n4.3 Eukaryotic Cells\n4.4 The Endomembrane\nSystem and Proteins\n4.5 The Cytoskeleton\n4.6 Connections\nbetween Cells and\nCellular Activities\nhuman), we call it an organism. Thus, cells are the basic building blocks of all organisms.\nSeveral cells of one kind that interconnect with each other and perform a shared function form tissues.\nThese tissues combine to form an organ (your stomach, heart, or brain), and several organs comprise an\norgan system (such as the digestive system, circulatory system, or nervous system). Several systems that\nfunction together form an organism (like a human being). Here, we will examine the structure and function\nof cells.\nThere are many types of cells, which scientists group into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and\neukaryotic. For example, we classify both animal and plant cells as eukaryotic cells; whereas, we classify\nbacterial cells as prokaryotic. Before discussing the criteria for determining whether a cell is prokaryotic or\neukaryotic, we will first examine how biologists study cells.\nMicroscopy\nCells vary in size. With few exceptions, we cannot see individual cells with the naked eye, so scientists use\nmicroscopes (micro- = \u201csmall\u201d; -scope = \u201cto look at\u201d) to study them. A microscope is an instrument that\nmagnifies an object. We photograph most cells with a microscope, so we can call these images micrographs.\nThe optics of a microscope\u2019s lenses change the image orientation that the user sees. A specimen that is right-\nside up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing left when one views\nthrough a microscope, and vice versa. Similarly, if one moves the slide left while looking through the\nmicroscope, it will appear to move right, and if one moves it down, it will seem to move up. This occurs\nbecause microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image. Because of the manner by which light\ntravels through the lenses, this two lens system produces an inverted image (binocular, or dissecting\nmicroscopes, work in a similar manner, but include an additional magnification system that makes the final\nimage appear to be upright).\nLight Microscopes\nTo give you a sense of cell size, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight\nmicrometers (abbreviated as eight \u03bcm) in diameter. A pin head is about two thousandths of a meter (two\nmm) in diameter. That means about 250 red blood cells could fit on a pinhead.\nMost student microscopes are light microscopes (Figure 4.2a). Visible light passes and bends through the\nlens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light microscopes are advantageous for viewing living\norganisms, but since individual cells are generally transparent, their components are not distinguishable\nunless they are colored with special stains. Staining, however, usually kills the cells.\nLight microscopes that undergraduates commonly use in the laboratory magnify up to approximately 400\ntimes. Two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and resolving power.\nMagnification is the process of enlarging an object in appearance. Resolving power is the microscope's\nability to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate: the higher the resolution, the better the image's\nclarity and detail. When one uses oil immersion lenses to study small objects, magnification usually\nincreases to 1,000 times. In order to gain a better understanding of cellular structure and function,\nscientists typically use electron microscopes.\n96\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 4.2 (a) Most light microscopes in a college biology lab can magnify cells up to approximately 400 times and have a resolution of\nabout 200 nanometers. (b) Electron microscopes provide a much higher magnification, 100,000x, and a have a resolution of 50 picometers.\n(credit a: modification of work by \"GcG\"/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by Evan Bench)\nElectron Microscopes\nIn contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes (Figure 4.2b) use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light. Not only\ndoes this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail (Figure 4.3), it also provides higher resolving power. The method\nto prepare the specimen for viewing with an electron microscope kills the specimen. Electrons have short wavelengths (shorter\nthan photons) that move best in a vacuum, so we cannot view living cells with an electron microscope.\nIn a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell\u2019s surface, creating details of cell\nsurface characteristics. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam penetrates the cell and provides details of a\ncell\u2019s internal structures. As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and expensive than light\nmicroscopes.\nFigure 4.3 (a) These Salmonella bacteria appear as tiny purple dots when viewed with a light microscope. (b) This scanning electron\nmicroscope micrograph shows Salmonella bacteria (in red) invading human cells (yellow). Even though subfigure (b) shows a different\nSalmonella specimen than subfigure (a), you can still observe the comparative increase in magnification and detail.

Skilled in crafting lenses, van Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of single-celled organisms, which he collectively\ntermed \u201canimalcules.\u201d\nIn the 1665 publication Micrographia, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term \u201ccell\u201d for the box-like structures he\nobserved when viewing cork tissue through a lens. In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa. Later\nadvances in lenses, microscope construction, and staining techniques enabled other scientists to see some components inside\ncells.\n4.1 \u2022 Studying Cells\n97\nBy the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed the unified\ncell theory, which states that one or more cells comprise all living things, the cell is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from\nexisting cells. Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to this theory.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nCytotechnologist\nHave you ever heard of a medical test called a Pap smear (Figure 4.4)? In this test, a doctor takes a small sample of cells from the\npatient's uterine cervix and sends it to a medical lab where a cytotechnologist stains the cells and examines them for any\nchanges that could indicate cervical cancer or a microbial infection.\nCytotechnologists (cyto- = \u201ccell\u201d) are professionals who study cells via microscopic examinations and other laboratory tests. They\nare trained to determine which cellular changes are within normal limits and which are abnormal. Their focus is not limited to\ncervical cells. They study cellular specimens that come from all organs. When they notice abnormalities, they consult a\npathologist, a medical doctor who interprets and diagnoses changes that disease in body tissue and fluids cause.\nCytotechnologists play a vital role in saving people\u2019s lives. When doctors discover abnormalities early, a patient\u2019s treatment can\nbegin sooner, which usually increases the chances of a successful outcome.\nFigure 4.4 These uterine cervix cells, viewed through a light microscope, are from a Pap smear. Normal cells are on the left. The cells on the\nright are infected with human papillomavirus (HPV). Notice that the infected cells are larger. Also, two of these cells each have two nuclei\ninstead of one, the normal number.

We classify only the predominantly single-celled\norganisms Bacteria and Archaea as prokaryotes (pro- = \u201cbefore\u201d; -kary- = \u201cnucleus\u201d). Animal cells, plants, fungi, and protists are\nall eukaryotes (eu- = \u201ctrue\u201d).\nComponents of Prokaryotic Cells\nAll cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell\u2019s interior from its\nsurrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like cytosol within the cell in which there are other cellular\ncomponents; 3) DNA, the cell's genetic material; and 4) ribosomes, which synthesize proteins. However, prokaryotes differ from\neukaryotic cells in several ways.\nA prokaryote is a simple, mostly single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound\n98\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\norganelle. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic DNA is in the cell's central\npart: the nucleoid (Figure 4.5).\nFigure 4.5 This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell. All prokaryotes have chromosomal DNA localized in a nucleoid,\nribosomes, a cell membrane, and a cell wall. The other structures shown are present in some, but not all, bacteria.\nMost prokaryotes have a peptidoglycan cell wall and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 4.5). The cell wall acts as an\nextra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to\nsurfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion. Pili exchange\ngenetic material during conjugation, the process by which one bacterium transfers genetic material to another through direct\ncontact. Bacteria use fimbriae to attach to a host cell.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nMicrobiologist\nThe most effective action anyone can take to prevent the spread of contagious illnesses is to wash his or her hands. Why?\nBecause microbes (organisms so tiny that they can only be seen with microscopes) are ubiquitous. They live on doorknobs,\nmoney, your hands, and many other surfaces. If someone sneezes into his hand and touches a doorknob, and afterwards you\ntouch that same doorknob, the microbes from the sneezer\u2019s mucus are now on your hands. If you touch your hands to your\nmouth, nose, or eyes, those microbes can enter your body and could make you sick.\nHowever, not all microbes (also called microorganisms) cause disease; most are actually beneficial. You have microbes in your\ngut that make vitamin K. Other microorganisms are used to ferment beer and wine.\nMicrobiologists are scientists who study microbes. Microbiologists can pursue a number of careers. Not only do they work in the\nfood industry, they are also employed in the veterinary and medical fields. They can work in the pharmaceutical sector, serving\nkey roles in research and development by identifying new antibiotic sources that can treat bacterial infections.\nEnvironmental microbiologists may look for new ways to use specially selected or genetically engineered microbes to remove\npollutants from soil or groundwater, as well as hazardous elements from contaminated sites. We call using these microbes\nbioremediation technologies. Microbiologists can also work in the bioinformatics field, providing specialized knowledge and\ninsight for designing, developing, and specificity of computer models of, for example, bacterial epidemics.\nCell Size\nAt 0.1 to 5.0 \u03bcm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters ranging from\n10 to 100 \u03bcm (Figure 4.6). The prokaryotes' small size allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly diffuse to\nother parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly diffuse. This is not the case in\neukaryotic cells, which have developed different structural adaptations to enhance intracellular transport.\n4.2 \u2022 Prokaryotic Cells\n99\nFigure 4.6 This figure shows relative sizes of microbes on a logarithmic scale (recall that each unit of increase in a logarithmic scale\nrepresents a 10-fold increase in the quantity measured).\nSmall size, in general, is necessary for all cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Let\u2019s examine why that is so. First, we\u2019ll\nconsider the area and volume of a typical cell. Not all cells are spherical in shape, but most tend to approximate a sphere. You\nmay remember from your high school geometry course that the formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4\u03c0r2, while the\nformula for its volume is 4\u03c0r3/3. Thus, as the radius of a cell increases, its surface area increases as the square of its radius, but\nits volume increases as the cube of its radius (much more rapidly). Therefore, as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-\nvolume ratio decreases. This same principle would apply if the cell had a cube shape (Figure 4.7). If the cell grows too large, the\nplasma membrane will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased volume. In\nother words, as a cell grows, it becomes less efficient. One way to become more efficient is to divide. Other ways are to increase\nsurface area by foldings of the cell membrane, become flat or thin and elongated, or develop organelles that perform specific\ntasks. These adaptations lead to developing more sophisticated cells, which we call eukaryotic cells.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 4.7 Notice that as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. When there is insufficient surface area to\nsupport a cell\u2019s increasing volume, a cell will either divide or die. The cell on the left has a volume of 1 mm3 and a surface area of 6 mm2,\nwith a surface area-to-volume ratio of 6 to 1; whereas, the cell on the right has a volume of 8 mm3 and a surface area of 24 mm2, with a\nsurface area-to-volume ratio of 3 to 1.\nProkaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells. What advantages might small cell size confer on a cell? What\nadvantages might large cell size have?\n100\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n4.3 Eukaryotic Cells\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the structure of eukaryotic cells\n\u2022\nCompare animal cells with plant cells\n\u2022\nState the role of the plasma membrane\n\u2022\nSummarize the functions of the major cell organelles\nHave you ever heard the phrase \u201cform follows function?\u201d It\u2019s a philosophy that many industries follow. In architecture, this\nmeans that buildings should be constructed to support the activities that will be carried out inside them. For example, a\nskyscraper should include several elevator banks. A hospital should have its emergency room easily accessible.\nOur natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function, especially in cell biology, and this will become clear as\nwe explore eukaryotic cells (Figure 4.8). Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells have: 1) a membrane-bound nucleus; 2)\nnumerous membrane-bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, chloroplasts, mitochondria, and\nothers; and 3) several, rod-shaped chromosomes. Because a membrane surrounds eukaryotic cell\u2019s nucleus, it has a \u201ctrue\nnucleus.\u201d The word \u201corganelle\u201d means \u201clittle organ,\u201d and, as we already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions,\njust as your body's organs have specialized functions.\nAt this point, it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells. Organelles\nallow different functions to be compartmentalized in different areas of the cell. Before turning to organelles, let\u2019s first examine\ntwo important components of the cell: the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\n4.3 \u2022 Eukaryotic Cells\n101\nFigure 4.8 These figures show the major organelles and other cell components of (a) a typical animal cell and (b) a typical eukaryotic plant\ncell. The plant cell has a cell wall, chloroplasts, plastids, and a central vacuole\u2014structures not in animal cells. Most cells do not have\nlysosomes or centrosomes.\nIf the nucleolus were not able to carry out its function, what other cellular organelles would be affected?\nThe Plasma Membrane\nLike prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane (Figure 4.9), a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins that\nseparates the internal contents of the cell from its surrounding environment. A phospholipid is a lipid molecule with two fatty\nacid chains and a phosphate-containing group. The plasma membrane controls the passage of organic molecules, ions, water,\nand oxygen into and out of the cell. Wastes (such as carbon dioxide and ammonia) also leave the cell by passing through the\nplasma membrane.\nFigure 4.9 The eukaryotic plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with proteins and cholesterol embedded in it.\nThe plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption fold into fingerlike projections that we call microvilli (singular =\n102\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nmicrovillus); (Figure 4.10). Such cells typically line the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. This\nis an excellent example of form following function. People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a\nprotein in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune response damages microvilli, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb\nnutrients. This leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free\ndiet.\nFigure 4.10 Microvilli, as they appear on cells lining the small intestine, increase the surface area available for absorption. These microvilli\nare only on the area of the plasma membrane that faces the cavity from which substances will be absorbed. (credit \"micrograph\":\nmodification of work by Louisa Howard)\nThe Cytoplasm\nThe cytoplasm is the cell's entire region between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (a structure we will discuss\nshortly). It is comprised of organelles suspended in the gel-like cytosol, the cytoskeleton, and various chemicals (Figure 4.8).\nEven though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a semi-solid consistency, which comes from the proteins\nwithin it. However, proteins are not the only organic molecules in the cytoplasm. Glucose and other simple sugars,\npolysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, and derivatives of glycerol are also there. Ions of sodium, potassium,\ncalcium, and many other elements also dissolve in the cytoplasm. Many metabolic reactions, including protein synthesis, take\nplace in the cytoplasm.\nThe Nucleus\nTypically, the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell (Figure 4.8). The nucleus (plural = nuclei) houses the cell\u2019s DNA\nand directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins. Let\u2019s look at it in more detail (Figure 4.11).\nFigure 4.11 The nucleus stores chromatin (DNA plus proteins) in a gel-like substance called the nucleoplasm. The nucleolus is a condensed\nchromatin region where ribosome synthesis occurs. We call the nucleus' boundary the nuclear envelope. It consists of two phospholipid\nbilayers: an outer and an inner membrane. The nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. Nuclear pores allow\nsubstances to enter and exit the nucleus.\n4.3 \u2022 Eukaryotic Cells\n103\nThe Nuclear Envelope\nThe nuclear envelope is a double-membrane structure that constitutes the nucleus' outermost portion (Figure 4.11). Both the\nnuclear envelope's inner and outer membranes are phospholipid bilayers.\nThe nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions, molecules, and RNA between the nucleoplasm\nand cytoplasm. The nucleoplasm is the semi-solid fluid inside the nucleus, where we find the chromatin and the nucleolus.\nChromatin and Chromosomes\nTo understand chromatin, it is helpful to first explore chromosomes, structures within the nucleus that are made up of DNA,\nthe hereditary material. You may remember that in prokaryotes, DNA is organized into a single circular chromosome. In\neukaryotes, chromosomes are linear structures. Every eukaryotic species has a specific number of chromosomes in the nucleus\nof each cell. For example, in humans, the chromosome number is 46, while in fruit flies, it is eight. Chromosomes are only\nvisible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to divide. When the cell is in the growth and\nmaintenance phases of its life cycle, proteins attach to chromosomes, and they resemble an unwound, jumbled bunch of\nthreads. We call these unwound protein-chromosome complexes chromatin (Figure 4.12). Chromatin describes the material\nthat makes up the chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed.\nFigure 4.12 (a) This image shows various levels of chromatin's organization (DNA and protein). (b) This image shows paired chromosomes.\n(credit b: modification of work by NIH; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe Nucleolus\nWe already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes, but how does it do this? Some chromosomes have sections\nof DNA that encode ribosomal RNA. A darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus (plural = nucleoli) aggregates\nthe ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported out through the pores\nin the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm.\nRibosomes\nRibosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. When we view them through an electron microscope,\nribosomes appear either as clusters (polyribosomes) or single, tiny dots that float freely in the cytoplasm. They may be attached\nto the plasma membrane's cytoplasmic side or the endoplasmic reticulum's cytoplasmic side and the nuclear envelope's outer\nmembrane (Figure 4.8). Electron microscopy shows us that ribosomes, which are large protein and RNA complexes, consist of\ntwo subunits, large and small (Figure 4.13). Ribosomes receive their \u201corders\u201d for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the\nDNA transcribes into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA travels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the\nsequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids in a protein. Amino acids are the building\nblocks of proteins.\n104\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 4.13 A large subunit (top) and a small subunit (bottom) comprise ribosomes. During protein synthesis, ribosomes assemble amino\nacids into proteins.\nBecause protein synthesis is an essential function of all cells (including enzymes, hormones, antibodies, pigments, structural\ncomponents, and surface receptors), there are ribosomes in practically every cell. Ribosomes are particularly abundant in cells\nthat synthesize large amounts of protein. For example, the pancreas is responsible for creating several digestive enzymes and\nthe cells that produce these enzymes contain many ribosomes. Thus, we see another example of form following function.\nMitochondria\nScientists often call mitochondria (singular = mitochondrion) \u201cpowerhouses\u201d or \u201cenergy factories\u201d of both plant and animal cells\nbecause they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell\u2019s main energy-carrying molecule. ATP\nrepresents the cell's short-term stored energy. Cellular respiration is the process of making ATP using the chemical energy in\nglucose and other nutrients. In mitochondria, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. In fact,\nthe carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes from the cellular reactions that produce carbon dioxide as a\nbyproduct.\nIn keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to point out that muscle cells have a very high\nconcentration of mitochondria that produce ATP. Your muscle cells need considerable energy to keep your body moving. When\nyour cells don\u2019t get enough oxygen, they do not make much ATP. Instead, producing lactic acid accompanies the small amount of\nATP they make in the absence of oxygen.\nMitochondria are oval-shaped, double membrane organelles (Figure 4.14) that have their own ribosomes and DNA. Each\nmembrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The inner layer has folds called cristae. We call the area\nsurrounded by the folds the mitochondrial matrix. The cristae and the matrix have different roles in cellular respiration.\nFigure 4.14 This electron micrograph shows a mitochondrion through an electron microscope. This organelle has an outer membrane and\nan inner membrane. The inner membrane contains folds, called cristae, which increase its surface area. We call the space between the two\nmembranes the intermembrane space, and the space inside the inner membrane the mitochondrial matrix. ATP synthesis takes place on\n4.3 \u2022 Eukaryotic Cells\n105\nthe inner membrane. (credit: modification of work by Matthew Britton; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nPeroxisomes\nPeroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that break down\nfatty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. (Many of these oxidation reactions release\nhydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined to peroxisomes,\nenzymes safely break down the H2O2 into oxygen and water.) For example, peroxisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol.\nGlyoxysomes, which are specialized peroxisomes in plants, are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars. Plant cells\ncontain many different types of peroxisomes that play a role in metabolism, pathogene defense, and stress response, to mention\na few.\nVesicles and Vacuoles\nVesicles and vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport. Other than the fact that vacuoles are\nsomewhat larger than vesicles, there is a very subtle distinction between them. Vesicle membranes can fuse with either the\nplasma membrane or other membrane systems within the cell. Additionally, some agents such as enzymes within plant vacuoles\nbreak down macromolecules. The vacuole's membrane does not fuse with the membranes of other cellular components.\nAnimal Cells versus Plant Cells\nAt this point, you know that each eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, a nucleus, ribosomes, mitochondria,\nperoxisomes, and in some, vacuoles, but there are some striking differences between animal and plant cells. While both animal\nand plant cells have microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), animal cells also have centrioles associated with the MTOC: a\ncomplex we call the centrosome. Animal cells each have a centrosome and lysosomes; whereas, most plant cells do not. Plant\ncells have a cell wall, chloroplasts and other specialized plastids, and a large central vacuole; whereas, animal cells do not.\nThe Centrosome\nThe centrosome is a microtubule-organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells. It contains a pair of centrioles, two\nstructures that lie perpendicular to each other (Figure 4.15). Each centriole is a cylinder of nine triplets of microtubules.\nFigure 4.15 The centrosome consists of two centrioles that lie at right angles to each other. Each centriole is a cylinder comprised of nine\ntriplets of microtubules. Nontubulin proteins (indicated by the green lines) hold the microtubule triplets together.\nThe centrosome (the organelle where all microtubules originate) replicates itself before a cell divides, and the centrioles appear\nto have some role in pulling the duplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of the dividing cell. However, the centriole's exact\nfunction in cell division isn\u2019t clear, because cells that have had the centrosome removed can still divide, and plant cells, which\nlack centrosomes, are capable of cell division.\nLysosomes\nAnimal cells have another set of organelles that most plant cells do not: lysosomes. The lysosomes are the cell\u2019s \u201cgarbage\ndisposal.\u201d In plant cells, the digestive processes take place in vacuoles. Enzymes within the lysosomes aid in breaking down\nproteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and even worn-out organelles. These enzymes are active at a much lower pH\nthan the cytoplasm's. Therefore, the pH within lysosomes is more acidic than the cytoplasm's pH. Many reactions that take place\nin the cytoplasm could not occur at a low pH, so again, the advantage of compartmentalizing the eukaryotic cell into organelles\n106\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nis apparent.\nThe Cell Wall\nIf you examine Figure 4.8, the plant cell diagram, you will see a structure external to the plasma membrane. This is the cell wall,\na rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Fungal and some protistan cells\nalso have cell walls. While the prokaryotic cell walls' chief component is peptidoglycan, the major organic molecule in the plant\n(and some protists') cell wall is cellulose (Figure 4.16), a polysaccharide comprised of glucose units. Have you ever noticed that\nwhen you bite into a raw vegetable, like celery, it crunches? That\u2019s because you are tearing the celery cells' rigid cell walls with\nyour teeth.\nFigure 4.16 Cellulose is a long chain of \u03b2-glucose molecules connected by a 1-4 linkage. The dashed lines at each end of the figure indicate\na series of many more glucose units. The size of the page makes it impossible to portray an entire cellulose molecule.\nChloroplasts\nLike the mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes, but chloroplasts have an entirely different function.\nChloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon\ndioxide, water, and light energy to make glucose and oxygen. This is a major difference between plants and animals. Plants\n(autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like sugars used in cellular respiration to provide ATP energy generated in the\nplant mitochondria. Animals (heterotrophs) must ingest their food.\nLike mitochondria, chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but within the space enclosed by a chloroplast\u2019s inner\nmembrane is a set of interconnected and stacked fluid-filled membrane sacs we call thylakoids (Figure 4.17). Each thylakoid\nstack is a granum (plural = grana). We call the fluid enclosed by the inner membrane that surrounds the grana the stroma.\nFigure 4.17 The chloroplast has an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and membrane structures - thylakoids that are stacked into\ngrana. We call the space inside the thylakoid membranes the thylakoid space. The light harvesting reactions take place in the thylakoid\nmembranes, and sugar synthesis takes place in the fluid inside the inner membrane, which we call the stroma. Chloroplasts also have their\nown genome, which is contained on a single circular chromosome.\nThe chloroplasts contain a green pigment, chlorophyll, which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of\nphotosynthesis. Like plant cells, photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts. Some bacteria perform photosynthesis, but their\nchlorophyll is not relegated to an organelle.\n4.3 \u2022 Eukaryotic Cells\n107\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nEndosymbiosis\nWe have mentioned that both mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA and ribosomes. Have you wondered why? Strong\nevidence points to endosymbiosis as the explanation.\nSymbiosis is a relationship in which organisms from two separate species depend on each other for their survival.\nEndosymbiosis (endo- = \u201cwithin\u201d) is a mutually beneficial relationship in which one organism lives inside the other.\nEndosymbiotic relationships abound in nature. We have already mentioned that microbes that produce vitamin K live inside the\nhuman gut. This relationship is beneficial for us because we are unable to synthesize vitamin K. It is also beneficial for the\nmicrobes because they are protected from other organisms and from drying out, and they receive abundant food from the\nenvironment of the large intestine.\nScientists have long noticed that bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are similar in size. We also know that bacteria have\nDNA and ribosomes, just like mitochondria and chloroplasts. Scientists believe that host cells and bacteria formed an\nendosymbiotic relationship when the host cells ingested both aerobic and autotrophic bacteria (cyanobacteria) but did not\ndestroy them. Through many millions of years of evolution, these ingested bacteria became more specialized in their functions,\nwith the aerobic bacteria becoming mitochondria and the autotrophic bacteria becoming chloroplasts.\nThe Central Vacuole\nPreviously, we mentioned vacuoles as essential components of plant cells. If you look at Figure 4.8b, you will see that plant cells\neach have a large central vacuole that occupies most of the cell's area. The central vacuole plays a key role in regulating the cell\u2019s\nconcentration of water in changing environmental conditions. Have you ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few\ndays, it wilts? That\u2019s because as the water concentration in the soil becomes lower than the water concentration in the plant,\nwater moves out of the central vacuoles and cytoplasm. As the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves the cell wall unsupported. This\nloss of support to the plant's cell walls results in the wilted appearance.\nThe central vacuole also supports the cell's expansion. When the central vacuole holds more water, the cell becomes larger\nwithout having to invest considerable energy in synthesizing new cytoplasm.\n4.4 The Endomembrane System and Proteins\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nList the components of the endomembrane system\n\u2022\nRecognize the relationship between the endomembrane system and its functions\nThe endomembrane system (endo = \u201cwithin\u201d) is a group of membranes and organelles (Figure 4.18) in eukaryotic cells that works\ntogether to modify, package, and transport lipids and proteins. It includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, and vesicles, which\nwe have already mentioned, and the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which we will cover shortly. Although not\ntechnically within the cell, the plasma membrane is included in the endomembrane system because, as you will see, it interacts\nwith the other endomembranous organelles. The endomembrane system does not include either mitochondria or chloroplast\nmembranes.\n108\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 4.18 Membrane and secretory proteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The RER also sometimes\nmodifies proteins. In this illustration, an attachment of a (purple) carbohydrate modifies a (green) integral membrane protein in the ER.\nVesicles with the integral protein bud from the ER and fuse with the Golgi apparatus' cis face. As the protein passes along the Golgi\u2019s\ncisternae, the addition of more carbohydrates further modifies it. After its synthesis is complete, it exits as an integral membrane protein of\nthe vesicle that buds from the Golgi\u2019s trans face. When the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane, the protein becomes an integral portion of\nthat cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by Magnus Manske)\nIf a peripheral membrane protein were synthesized in the lumen (inside) of the ER, would it end up on the inside or outside of\nthe plasma membrane?\nThe Endoplasmic Reticulum\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 4.18) is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that collectively\nmodifies proteins and synthesizes lipids. However, these two functions take place in separate areas of the ER: the rough ER and\nthe smooth ER, respectively.\nWe call the ER tubules' hollow portion the lumen or cisternal space. The ER's membrane, which is a phospholipid bilayer\nembedded with proteins, is continuous with the nuclear envelope.\nRough ER\nScientists have named the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) as such because the ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic\n4.4 \u2022 The Endomembrane System and Proteins\n109\nsurface give it a studded appearance when viewing it through an electron microscope (Figure 4.19).\nFigure 4.19 This transmission electron micrograph shows the rough endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles in a pancreatic cell.\n(credit: modification of work by Louisa Howard)\nRibosomes transfer their newly synthesized proteins into the RER's lumen where they undergo structural modifications, such as\nfolding or acquiring side chains. These modified proteins incorporate into cellular membranes\u2014the ER or the ER's or other\norganelles' membranes. The proteins can also secrete from the cell (such as protein hormones, enzymes). The RER also makes\nphospholipids for cellular membranes.\nIf the phospholipids or modified proteins are not destined to stay in the RER, they will reach their destinations via transport\nvesicles that bud from the RER\u2019s membrane (Figure 4.18).\nSince the RER is engaged in modifying proteins (such as enzymes, for example) that secrete from the cell, you would be correct\nin assuming that the RER is abundant in cells that secrete proteins. This is the case with liver cells, for example.\nSmooth ER\nThe smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface\n(Figure 4.18). SER functions include synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids, and steroid hormones; detoxification of medications and\npoisons; and storing calcium ions.\nIn muscle cells, a specialized SER, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is responsible for storing calcium ions that are needed to trigger\nthe muscle cells' coordinated contractions.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can watch an excellent animation of the endomembrane system here (http://openstax.org/l/insane_in_the_endomembrane)\n. At the end of the animation, there is a short self-assessment.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nCardiologist\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. This is primarily due to our sedentary lifestyle and our high\ntrans-fat diets.\nHeart failure is just one of many disabling heart conditions. Heart failure does not mean that the heart has stopped working.\nRather, it means that the heart can\u2019t pump with sufficient force to transport oxygenated blood to all the vital organs. Left\nuntreated, heart failure can lead to kidney failure and other organ failure.\nCardiac muscle tissue comprises the heart's wall. Heart failure occurs when cardiac muscle cells' endoplasmic reticula do not\nfunction properly. As a result, an insufficient number of calcium ions are available to trigger a sufficient contractile force.\nCardiologists (cardi- = \u201cheart\u201d; -ologist = \u201cone who studies\u201d) are doctors who specialize in treating heart diseases, including\nheart failure. Cardiologists can diagnose heart failure via a physical examination, results from an electrocardiogram (ECG, a test\nthat measures the heart's electrical activity), a chest X-ray to see whether the heart is enlarged, and other tests. If the\ncardiologist diagnoses heart failure, he or she will typically prescribe appropriate medications and recommend a reduced table\n110\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nsalt intake and a supervised exercise program.\nThe Golgi Apparatus\nWe have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER and transport their contents elsewhere, but where do the vesicles\ngo? Before reaching their final destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need sorting, packaging, and\ntagging so that they end up in the right place. Sorting, tagging, packaging, and distributing lipids and proteins takes place in\nthe Golgi apparatus (also called the Golgi body), a series of flattened membranes (Figure 4.20).\nFigure 4.20 The Golgi apparatus in this white blood cell is visible as a stack of semicircular, flattened rings in the lower portion of the image.\nYou can see several vesicles near the Golgi apparatus. (credit: modification of work by Louisa Howard)\nWe call the Golgi apparatus' the cis face. The opposite side is the trans face. The transport vesicles that formed from the ER travel\nto the cis face, fuse with it, and empty their contents into the Golgi apparatus' lumen. As the proteins and lipids travel through\nthe Golgi, they undergo further modifications that allow them to be sorted. The most frequent modification is adding short\nsugar molecule chains. These newly modified proteins and lipids then tag with phosphate groups or other small molecules in\norder to travel to their proper destinations.\nFinally, the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into secretory vesicles that bud from the Golgi's trans face. While some\nof these vesicles deposit their contents into other cell parts where they will be used, other secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma\nmembrane and release their contents outside the cell.\nIn another example of form following function, cells that engage in a great deal of secretory activity (such as salivary gland cells\nthat secrete digestive enzymes or immune system cells that secrete antibodies) have an abundance of Golgi.\nIn plant cells, the Golgi apparatus has the additional role of synthesizing polysaccharides, some of which are incorporated into\nthe cell wall and some of which other cell parts use.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nGeneticist\nMany diseases arise from genetic mutations that prevent synthesizing critical proteins. One such disease is Lowe disease (or\noculocerebrorenal syndrome, because it affects the eyes, brain, and kidneys). In Lowe disease, there is a deficiency in an enzyme\nlocalized to the Golgi apparatus. Children with Lowe disease are born with cataracts, typically develop kidney disease after the\nfirst year of life, and may have impaired mental abilities.\nA mutation on the X chromosome causes Lowe disease. The X chromosome is one of the two human sex chromosomes, as these\nchromosomes determine a person's sex. Females possess two X chromosomes while males possess one X and one Y\nchromosome. In females, the genes on only one of the two X chromosomes are expressed. Females who carry the Lowe disease\ngene on one of their X chromosomes are carriers and do not show symptoms of the disease. However, males only have one X\nchromosome and the genes on this chromosome are always expressed. Therefore, males will always have Lowe disease if their X\nchromosome carries the Lowe disease gene. Geneticists have identified the mutated gene's location, as well as many other\nmutation locations that cause genetic diseases. Through prenatal testing, a woman can find out if the fetus she is carrying may\nbe afflicted with one of several genetic diseases.\n4.4 \u2022 The Endomembrane System and Proteins\n111\nGeneticists analyze prenatal genetic test results and may counsel pregnant women on available options. They may also conduct\ngenetic research that leads to new drugs or foods, or perform DNA analyses for forensic investigations.\nLysosomes\nIn addition to their role as the digestive component and organelle-recycling facility of animal cells, lysosomes are part of the\nendomembrane system. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to destroy pathogens (disease-causing organisms) that\nmight enter the cell. A good example of this occurs in macrophages, a group of white blood cells which are part of your body\u2019s\nimmune system. In a process that scientists call phagocytosis or endocytosis, a section of the macrophage's plasma membrane\ninvaginates (folds in) and engulfs a pathogen. The invaginated section, with the pathogen inside, then pinches itself off from the\nplasma membrane and becomes a vesicle. The vesicle fuses with a lysosome. The lysosome\u2019s hydrolytic enzymes then destroy the\npathogen (Figure 4.21).\nFigure 4.21 A macrophage has engulfed (phagocytized) a potentially pathogenic bacterium and then fuses with lysosomes within the cell to\ndestroy the pathogen. Other organelles are present in the cell but for simplicity we do not show them.\n4.5 The Cytoskeleton\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the cytoskeleton\n\u2022\nCompare the roles of microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules\n\u2022\nCompare and contrast cilia and flagella\n\u2022\nSummarize the differences among the components of prokaryotic cells, animal cells, and plant cells\nIf you were to remove all the organelles from a cell, would the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm be the only components left?\nNo. Within the cytoplasm, there would still be ions and organic molecules, plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain\nthe cell's shape, secure some organelles in specific positions, allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell, and enable\ncells within multicellular organisms to move. Collectively, scientists call this network of protein fibers the cytoskeleton. There\nare three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (Figure 4.22). Here,\nwe will examine each.\n112\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 4.22 Microfilaments thicken the cortex around the cell's inner edge. Like rubber bands, they resist tension. There are microtubules in\nthe cell's interior where they maintain their shape by resisting compressive forces. There are intermediate filaments throughout the cell\nthat hold organelles in place.\nMicrofilaments\nOf the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton, microfilaments are the narrowest. They function in cellular movement,\nhave a diameter of about 7 nm, and are comprised of two globular protein intertwined strands, which we call actin (Figure 4.23).\nFor this reason, we also call microfilaments actin filaments.\n4.5 \u2022 The Cytoskeleton\n113\nFigure 4.23 Two intertwined actin strands comprise microfilaments.\nATP powers actin to assemble its filamentous form, which serves as a track for the movement of a motor protein we call myosin.\nThis enables actin to engage in cellular events requiring motion, such as cell division in eukaryotic cells and cytoplasmic\nstreaming, which is the cell cytoplasm's circular movement in plant cells. Actin and myosin are plentiful in muscle cells. When\nyour actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, your muscles contract.\nMicrofilaments also provide some rigidity and shape to the cell. They can depolymerize (disassemble) and reform quickly, thus\nenabling a cell to change its shape and move. White blood cells (your body\u2019s infection-fighting cells) make good use of this\nability. They can move to an infection site and phagocytize the pathogen.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo see an example of a white blood cell in action, watch a short time-lapse video of the cell capturing two bacteria. It engulfs one\nand then moves on to the other.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/chasing_bcteria)\nIntermediate Filaments\nSeveral strands of fibrous proteins that are wound together comprise intermediate filaments (Figure 4.24). Cytoskeleton\nelements get their name from the fact that their diameter, 8 to 10 nm, is between those of microfilaments and microtubules.\nFigure 4.24 Intermediate filaments consist of several intertwined strands of fibrous proteins.\nIntermediate filaments have no role in cell movement. Their function is purely structural. They bear tension, thus maintaining\nthe cell's shape, and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place. Figure 4.22 shows how intermediate filaments create a\nsupportive scaffolding inside the cell.\n114\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe intermediate filaments are the most diverse group of cytoskeletal elements. Several fibrous protein types are in the\nintermediate filaments. You are probably most familiar with keratin, the fibrous protein that strengthens your hair, nails, and\nthe skin's epidermis.\nMicrotubules\nAs their name implies, microtubules are small hollow tubes. Polymerized dimers of \u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-tubulin, two globular\nproteins, comprise the microtubule's walls (Figure 4.25). With a diameter of about 25 nm, microtubules are cytoskeletons'\nwidest components. They help the cell resist compression, provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell, and pull\nreplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. Like microfilaments, microtubules can disassemble and reform\nquickly.\nFigure 4.25 Microtubules are hollow. Their walls consist of 13 polymerized dimers of \u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-tubulin (right image). The left image\nshows the tube's molecular structure.\nMicrotubules are also the structural elements of flagella, cilia, and centrioles (the latter are the centrosome's two perpendicular\nbodies). In animal cells, the centrosome is the microtubule-organizing center. In eukaryotic cells, flagella and cilia are quite\ndifferent structurally from their counterparts in prokaryotes, as we discuss below.\nFlagella and Cilia\nThe flagella (singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and enable an entire cell\nto move (for example, sperm, Euglena, and some prokaryotes). When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella.\nHowever, when cilia (singular = cilium) are present, many of them extend along the plasma membrane's entire surface. They are\nshort, hair-like structures that move entire cells (such as paramecia) or substances along the cell's outer surface (for example, the\ncilia of cells lining the Fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus, or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that\ntrap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils.)\nDespite their differences in length and number, flagella and cilia share a common structural arrangement of microtubules called\na \u201c9 + 2 array.\u201d This is an appropriate name because a single flagellum or cilium is made of a ring of nine microtubule doublets,\nsurrounding a single microtubule doublet in the center (Figure 4.26).\n4.5 \u2022 The Cytoskeleton\n115\nFigure 4.26 This transmission electron micrograph of two flagella shows the microtubules' 9 + 2 array: nine microtubule doublets surround\na single microtubule doublet.

As you might expect, if cells are to work together, they\nmust communicate with each other, just as you need to communicate with others if you work on a group project. Let\u2019s take a\nlook at how cells communicate with each other.\nExtracellular Matrix of Animal Cells\nWhile cells in most multicellular organisms release materials into the extracellular space, animal cells will be discussed as an\nexample. The primary components of these materials are proteins, and the most abundant protein is collagen. Collagen fibers\nare interwoven with proteoglycans, which are carbohydrate-containing protein molecules. Collectively, we call these materials\nthe extracellular matrix (Figure 4.27). Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue, but it also\n4.6 \u2022 Connections between Cells and Cellular Activities\n117\nallows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other. How can this happen?\nFigure 4.27 The extracellular matrix consists of a network of proteins and carbohydrates.\nCells have protein receptors on their plasma membranes' extracellular surfaces. When a molecule within the matrix binds to the\nreceptor, it changes the receptor's molecular structure. The receptor, in turn, changes the microfilaments' conformation\npositioned just inside the plasma membrane. These conformational changes induce chemical signals inside the cell that reach\nthe nucleus and turn \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d the transcription of specific DNA sections, which affects the associated protein production,\nthus changing the activities within the cell.\nBlood clotting provides an example of the extracellular matrix's role in cell communication. When the cells lining a blood vessel\nare damaged, they display a protein receptor, which we call tissue factor. When tissue factor binds with another factor in the\nextracellular matrix, it causes platelets to adhere to the damaged blood vessel's wall, stimulates the adjacent smooth muscle cells\nin the blood vessel to contract (thus constricting the blood vessel), and initiates a series of steps that stimulate the platelets to\nproduce clotting factors.\nIntercellular Junctions\nCells can also communicate with each other via direct contact, or intercellular junctions. There are differences in the ways that\nplant and animal and fungal cells communicate. Plasmodesmata are junctions between plant cells; whereas, animal cell contacts\ninclude tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.\nPlasmodesmata\nIn general, long stretches of the plasma membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another because the cell wall\nthat surrounds each cell separates them (Figure 4.8). How then, can a plant transfer water and other soil nutrients from its\nroots, through its stems, and to its leaves? Such transport uses the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) primarily. There also\nexist structural modifications, which we call plasmodesmata (singular = plasmodesma). Numerous channels that pass between\nadjacent plant cells' cell walls connect their cytoplasm, and enable transport of materials from cell to cell, and thus throughout\nthe plant (Figure 4.28).\n118\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 4.28 A plasmodesma is a channel between two adjacent plant cells' cell walls. Plasmodesmata allow materials to pass from one\nplant cell's cytoplasm to an adjacent cell's cytoplasm.\nTight Junctions\nA tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells (Figure 4.29). Proteins (predominantly two proteins called\nclaudins and occludins) tightly hold the cells against each other.\nFigure 4.29 Tight junctions form watertight connections between adjacent animal cells. Proteins create tight junction adherence. (credit:\nmodification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThis tight adherence prevents materials from leaking between the cells; tight junctions are typically found in epithelial tissues\nthat line internal organs and cavities, and comprise most of the skin. For example, the tight junctions of the epithelial cells\nlining your urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking out into the extracellular space.\nDesmosomes\nAlso only in animal cells are desmosomes, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells (Figure 4.30). Cadherins,\nshort proteins in the plasma membrane connect to intermediate filaments to create desmosomes. The cadherins connect two\n4.6 \u2022 Connections between Cells and Cellular Activities\n119\nadjacent cells and maintain the cells in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch, like the skin, heart, and\nmuscles.\nFigure 4.30 A desmosome forms a very strong spot weld between cells. Linking cadherins and intermediate filaments create it. (credit:\nmodification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nGap Junctions\nGap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for\ntransporting ions, nutrients, and other substances that enable cells to communicate (Figure 4.31). Structurally, however, gap\njunctions and plasmodesmata differ.\n120\nChapter 4 \u2022 Cell Structure\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 4.31 A gap junction is a protein-lined pore that allows water and small molecules to pass between adjacent animal cells. (credit:\nmodification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nGap junctions develop when a set of six proteins (connexins) in the plasma membrane arrange themselves in an elongated\ndonut-like configuration - a connexon. When the connexon's pores (\u201cdoughnut holes\u201d) in adjacent animal cells align, a channel\nbetween the two cells forms. Gap junctions are particularly important in cardiac muscle. The electrical signal for the muscle to\ncontract passes efficiently through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in tandem.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo conduct a virtual microscopy lab and review the parts of a cell, work through the steps of this interactive assignment\n(http://openstax.org/l/microscopy_lab) .\n4.6 \u2022 Connections between Cells and Cellular Activities\n121\n", "key_terms": "\ncell theory\nsee unified cell theory\ncell wall\nrigid cell covering comprised of various molecules\nthat protects the cell, provides structural support, and\ngives shape to the cell\ncentral vacuole\nlarge plant cell organelle that regulates the\ncell\u2019s storage compartment, holds water, and plays a\nsignificant role in cell growth as the site of\nmacromolecule degradation\ncentrosome\nregion in animal cells made of two centrioles\nthat serves as an organizing center for microtubules\nchlorophyll\ngreen pigment that captures the light energy\nthat drives the light reactions of photosynthesis\nchloroplast\nplant cell organelle that carries out\nphotosynthesis\nchromatin\nprotein-DNA complex that serves as the\nchromosomes' building material\nchromosome\nstructure within the nucleus that comprises\nchromatin that contains DNA, the hereditary material\ncilium\n(plural = cilia) short, hair-like structure that extends\nfrom the plasma membrane in large numbers and\nfunctions to move an entire cell or move substances along\nthe cell's outer surface\ncytoplasm\nentire region between the plasma membrane\nand the nuclear envelope, consisting of organelles\nsuspended in the gel-like cytosol, the cytoskeleton, and\nvarious chemicals\ncytoskeleton\nprotein fiber network that collectively\nmaintains the cell's shape, secures some organelles in\nspecific positions, allows cytoplasm and vesicles to move\nwithin the cell, and enables unicellular organisms to\nmove independently\ncytosol\nthe cytoplasm's gel-like material in which cell\nstructures are suspended\ndesmosome\nlinkages between adjacent epithelial cells that\nform when cadherins in the plasma membrane attach to\nintermediate filaments\nelectron microscope\nan instrument that magnifies an\nobject using an electron beam that passes and bends\nthrough a lens system to visualize a specimen\nendomembrane system\ngroup of organelles and\nmembranes in eukaryotic cells that work together\nmodifying, packaging, and transporting lipids and\nproteins\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER)\nseries of interconnected\nmembranous structures within eukaryotic cells that\ncollectively modify proteins and synthesize lipids\neukaryotic cell\ncell that has a membrane-bound nucleus\nand several other membrane-bound compartments or\nsacs\nextracellular matrix\nmaterial secreted from animal or\nfungal cells that provides mechanical protection and\nanchoring for the cells in the tissue\nflagellum\n(plural = flagella) long, hair-like structure that\nextends from the plasma membrane and moves the cell\ngap junction\nchannel between two adjacent animal cells\nthat allows ions, nutrients, and low molecular weight\nsubstances to pass between cells, enabling the cells to\ncommunicate\nGolgi apparatus\neukaryotic organelle comprised of a series\nof stacked membranes that sorts, tags, and packages\nlipids and proteins for distribution\nintermediate filament\ncytoskeletal component, comprised\nof several fibrous protein intertwined strands, that bears\ntension, supports cell-cell junctions, and anchors cells to\nextracellular structures\nlight microscope\nan instrument that magnifies an object\nusing a beam of visible light that passes and bends\nthrough a lens system to visualize a specimen\nlysosome\norganelle in an animal cell that functions as the\ncell\u2019s digestive component;

Prokaryotic cells range\nin diameter from 0.1 to 5.0 \u03bcm.\nAs a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio\ndecreases. If the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane\nwill not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of\ndiffusion required for the increased volume.\n4.3 Eukaryotic Cells\nLike a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma\nmembrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a eukaryotic cell\nis typically larger than a prokaryotic cell, has a true nucleus\n(meaning a membrane surrounds its DNA), and has other\nmembrane-bound organelles that allow for\ncompartmentalizing functions. The plasma membrane is a\nphospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The nucleus\u2019s\nnucleolus is the site of ribosome assembly. We find\nribosomes either in the cytoplasm or attached to the\ncytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or endoplasmic\nreticulum. They perform protein synthesis. Mitochondria\nparticipate in cellular respiration. They are responsible for\nthe majority of ATP produced in the cell. Peroxisomes\nhydrolyze fatty acids, amino acids, and some toxins. Vesicles\nand vacuoles are storage and transport compartments. In\nplant cells, vacuoles also help break down macromolecules.\nAnimal cells also have a centrosome and lysosomes. The\ncentrosome has two bodies perpendicular to each other, the\ncentrioles, and has an unknown purpose in cell division.\nLysosomes are the digestive organelles of animal cells.\nPlant cells and plant-like cells each have a cell wall,\nchloroplasts, and a central vacuole. The plant cell wall, whose\nprimary component is cellulose, protects the cell, provides\nstructural support, and gives the cell shape. Photosynthesis\ntakes place in chloroplasts. The central vacuole can expand\nwithout having to produce more cytoplasm.\n4.4 The Endomembrane System and\nProteins\nThe endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope,\nlysosomes, vesicles, the ER, and Golgi apparatus, as well as\nthe plasma membrane. These cellular components work\ntogether to modify, package, tag, and transport proteins and\nlipids that form the membranes.\nThe RER modifies proteins and synthesizes phospholipids in\ncell membranes. The SER synthesizes carbohydrates, lipids,\nand steroid hormones; engages in the detoxification of\nmedications and poisons; and stores calcium ions. Sorting,\ntagging, packaging, and distributing lipids and proteins take\nplace in the Golgi apparatus. Budding RER and Golgi\nmembranes create lysosomes. Lysosomes digest\nmacromolecules, recycle worn-out organelles, and destroy\npathogens.\n4.5 The Cytoskeleton\nThe cytoskeleton has three different protein element types.\nFrom narrowest to widest, they are the microfilaments (actin\nfilaments), intermediate filaments, and microtubules.\nChapter 4 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n123\nBiologists often associate microfilaments with myosin. They\nprovide rigidity and shape to the cell and facilitate cellular\nmovements. Intermediate filaments bear tension and anchor\nthe nucleus and other organelles in place. Microtubules help\nthe cell resist compression, serve as tracks for motor\nproteins that move vesicles through the cell, and pull\nreplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell.\nThey are also the structural element of centrioles, flagella,\nand cilia.\n4.6 Connections between Cells and\nCellular Activities\nAnimal cells communicate via their extracellular matrices\nand are connected to each other via tight junctions,\ndesmosomes, and gap junctions. Plant cells are connected\nand communicate with each other via plasmodesmata.\nWhen protein receptors on the plasma membrane's surface\nof an animal cell bind to a substance in the extracellular\nmatrix, a chain of reactions begins that changes activities\ntaking place within the cell. Plasmodesmata are channels\nbetween adjacent plant cells, while gap junctions are\nchannels between adjacent animal cells. However, their\nstructures are quite different. A tight junction is a watertight\nseal between two adjacent cells, while a desmosome acts like\na spot weld.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

(credit: modification of work by Randy Le\u2019Moine)\nINTRODUCTION The plasma membrane, the cell membrane, has many functions, but the most basic\none is to define the cell's borders and keep the cell functional. The plasma membrane is selectively\npermeable. This means that the membrane allows some materials to freely enter or leave the cell, while\nother materials cannot move freely, but require a specialized structure, and occasionally, even energy\ninvestment for crossing.\nChapter Outline\n5.1 Components and\nStructure\n5.2 Passive Transport\n5.3 Active Transport\n5.4 Bulk Transport\n5.1 Components and Structure\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nUnderstand the cell membrane fluid mosaic model\n\u2022\nDescribe phospholipid, protein, and carbohydrate functions in membranes\n\u2022\nDiscuss membrane fluidity\nA cell\u2019s plasma membrane defines the cell, outlines its borders, and determines the nature of its interaction\nwith its environment (see Table 5.1 for a summary). Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and\nexcrete still others, all in controlled quantities. The plasma membrane must be very flexible to allow certain\ncells, such as red and white blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are\nthe more obvious plasma membrane functions. In addition, the plasma membrane's surface carries markers\nthat allow cells to recognize one another, which is vital for tissue and organ formation during early\ndevelopment, and which later plays a role in the immune response's \u201cself\u201d versus \u201cnon-self\u201d distinction.\nAmong the most sophisticated plasma membrane functions is the ability for complex, integral proteins,\nreceptors to transmit signals. These proteins act both as extracellular input receivers and as intracellular\nprocessing activators. These membrane receptors provide extracellular attachment sites for effectors like\nhormones and growth factors, and they activate intracellular response cascades when their effectors are\nbound. Occasionally, viruses hijack receptors (HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, is one example) that\nuse them to gain entry into cells, and at times, the genes encoding receptors become mutated, causing the\nsignal transduction process to malfunction with disastrous consequences.\nFluid Mosaic Model\nScientists identified the plasma membrane in the 1890s, and its chemical components in 1915. The principal\ncomponents they identified were lipids and proteins. In 1935, Hugh Davson and James Danielli proposed the\nplasma membrane's structure. This was the first model that others in the scientific community widely\naccepted. It was based on the plasma membrane's \u201crailroad track\u201d appearance in early electron micrographs.\nDavson and Danielli theorized that the plasma membrane's structure resembles a sandwich. They made the\nanalogy of proteins to bread, and lipids to the filling. In the 1950s, advances in microscopy, notably\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM), allowed researchers to see that the plasma membrane's core\nconsisted of a double, rather than a single, layer. In 1972, S.J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson proposed a new\nmodel that provides microscopic observations and better explains plasma membrane function.\nThe explanation, the fluid mosaic model, has evolved somewhat over time, but it still best accounts for\nplasma membrane structure and function as we now understand them. The fluid mosaic model describes\nthe plasma membrane structure as a mosaic of components\u2014including phospholipids, cholesterol,\nproteins, and carbohydrates\u2014that gives the membrane a fluid character. Plasma membranes range from 5\nto 10 nm in thickness. For comparison, human red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are\napproximately 8 \u00b5m wide, or approximately 1,000 times wider than a plasma membrane. The membrane\ndoes look a bit like a sandwich (Figure 5.2).\n128\nChapter 5 \u2022 Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 5.2 The plasma membrane fluid mosaic model describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination of phospholipids,\ncholesterol, and proteins. Carbohydrates attached to lipids (glycolipids) and to proteins (glycoproteins) extend from the membrane's\noutward-facing surface.\nA plasma membrane's principal components are lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), proteins, and carbohydrates attached to\nsome of the lipids and proteins. A phospholipid is a molecule consisting of glycerol, two fatty acids, and a phosphate-linked\nhead group. Cholesterol, another lipid comprised of four fused carbon rings, is situated alongside the phospholipids in the\nmembrane's core. The protein, lipid, and carbohydrate proportions in the plasma membrane vary with cell type, but for a typical\nhuman cell, protein accounts for about 50 percent of the composition by mass, lipids (of all types) account for about 40 percent,\nand carbohydrates comprise the remaining 10 percent. However, protein and lipid concentration varies with different cell\nmembranes. For example, myelin, an outgrowth of specialized cells' membrane that insulates the peripheral nerves' axons,\ncontains only 18 percent protein and 76 percent lipid. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains 76 percent protein and only\n24 percent lipid. The plasma membrane of human red blood cells is 30 percent lipid. Carbohydrates are present only on the\nplasma membrane's exterior surface and are attached to proteins, forming glycoproteins, or attached to lipids, forming\nglycolipids.\nPhospholipids\nThe membrane's main fabric comprises amphiphilic, phospholipid molecules. The hydrophilic or \u201cwater-loving\u201d areas of these\nmolecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist\u2019s rendition of the model) (Figure 5.2) are in contact with the aqueous\nfluid both inside and outside the cell. Hydrophobic, or water-hating molecules, tend to be non-polar. They interact with other\nnon-polar molecules in chemical reactions, but generally do not interact with polar molecules. When placed in water,\nhydrophobic molecules tend to form a ball or cluster. The phospholipids' hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with water\nand other polar molecules on both the cell's exterior and interior. Thus, the membrane surfaces that face the cell's interior and\nexterior are hydrophilic. In contrast, the cell membrane's interior is hydrophobic and will not interact with water. Therefore,\nphospholipids form an excellent two-layer cell membrane that separates fluid within the cell from the fluid outside the cell.\nA phospholipid molecule (Figure 5.3) consists of a three-carbon glycerol backbone with two fatty acid molecules attached to\ncarbons 1 and 2, and a phosphate-containing group attached to the third carbon. This arrangement gives the overall molecule a\nhead area (the phosphate-containing group), which has a polar character or negative charge, and a tail area (the fatty acids),\nwhich has no charge. The head can form hydrogen bonds, but the tail cannot. Scientists call a molecule with a positively or\nnegatively charged area and an uncharged, or non-polar, area amphiphilic or \u201cdual-loving.\u201d\n5.1 \u2022 Components and Structure\n129\nFigure 5.3 A hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails comprise this phospholipid molecule. The hydrophilic head group consists of a\nphosphate-containing group attached to a glycerol molecule. The hydrophobic tails, each containing either a saturated or an unsaturated\nfatty acid, are long hydrocarbon chains.\nThis characteristic is vital to the plasma membrane's structure because, in water, phospholipids arrange themselves with their\nhydrophobic tails facing each other and their hydrophilic heads facing out. In this way, they form a lipid bilayer\u2014a double\nlayered phospholipid barrier that separates the water and other materials on one side from the water and other materials on the\nother side. Phosopholipids heated in an aqueous solution usually spontaneously form small spheres or droplets (micelles or\nliposomes), with their hydrophilic heads forming the exterior and their hydrophobic tails on the inside (Figure 5.4).\n130\nChapter 5 \u2022 Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 5.4 In an aqueous solution, phospholipids usually arrange themselves with their polar heads facing outward and their hydrophobic\ntails facing inward. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nProteins\nProteins comprise the plasma membranes' second major component. Integral proteins, or integrins, as their name suggests,\nintegrate completely into the membrane structure, and their hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions interact with the\nphospholipid bilayer's hydrophobic region (Figure 5.2). Single-pass integral membrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic\ntransmembrane segment that consists of 20\u201325 amino acids. Some span only part of the membrane\u2014associating with a single\nlayer\u2014while others stretch from one side to the other, and are exposed on either side. Up to 12 single protein segments comprise\nsome complex proteins, which are extensively folded and embedded in the membrane (Figure 5.5). This protein type has a\nhydrophilic region or regions, and one or several mildly hydrophobic regions. This arrangement of protein regions orients the\nprotein alongside the phospholipids, with the protein's hydrophobic region adjacent to the phosopholipids' tails and the\nprotein's hydrophilic region or regions protruding from the membrane and in contact with the cytosol or extracellular fluid.\nFigure 5.5 Integral membrane proteins may have one or more alpha-helices that span the membrane (examples 1 and 2), or they may have\nbeta-sheets that span the membrane (example 3). (credit: \u201cFoobar\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\n5.1 \u2022 Components and Structure\n131\nPeripheral proteins are on the membranes' exterior and interior surfaces, attached either to integral proteins or to\nphospholipids. Peripheral proteins, along with integral proteins, may serve as enzymes, as structural attachments for the\ncytoskeleton's fibers, or as part of the cell\u2019s recognition sites. Scientists sometimes refer to these as \u201ccell-specific\u201d proteins. The\nbody recognizes its own proteins and attacks foreign proteins associated with invasive pathogens.\nCarbohydrates\nCarbohydrates are the third major plasma membrane component. They are always on the cells' exterior surface and are bound\neither to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids) (Figure 5.2). These carbohydrate chains may consist\nof 2\u201360 monosaccharide units and can be either straight or branched. Along with peripheral proteins, carbohydrates form\nspecialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each other. These sites have unique patterns that allow for cell\nrecognition, much the way that the facial features unique to each person allow individuals to recognize him or her. This\nrecognition function is very important to cells, as it allows the immune system to differentiate between body cells (\u201cself\u201d) and\nforeign cells or tissues (\u201cnon-self\u201d). Similar glycoprotein and glycolipid types are on the surfaces of viruses and may change\nfrequently, preventing immune cells from recognizing and attacking them.\nWe collectively refer to these carbohydrates on the cell's exterior surface\u2014the carbohydrate components of both glycoproteins\nand glycolipids\u2014as the glycocalyx (meaning \u201csugar coating\u201d). The glycocalyx is highly hydrophilic and attracts large amounts of\nwater to the cell's surface. This aids in the cell's interaction with its watery environment and in the cell\u2019s ability to obtain\nsubstances dissolved in the water. As we discussed above, the glycocalyx is also important for cell identification, self/non-self\ndetermination, and embryonic development, and is used in cell to cell attachments to form tissues.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nHow Viruses Infect Specific Organs\nGlycoprotein and glycolipid patterns on the cells' surfaces give many viruses an opportunity for infection. HIV and hepatitis\nviruses infect only specific organs or cells in the human body. HIV is able to penetrate the plasma membranes of a subtype of\nlymphocytes called T-helper cells, as well as some monocytes and central nervous system cells. The hepatitis virus attacks liver\ncells.\nThese viruses are able to invade these cells, because the cells have binding sites on their surfaces that are specific to and\ncompatible with certain viruses (Figure 5.6). Other recognition sites on the virus\u2019s surface interact with the human immune\nsystem, prompting the body to produce antibodies. Antibodies are made in response to the antigens or proteins associated with\ninvasive pathogens, or in response to foreign cells, such as might occur with an organ transplant. These same sites serve as\nplaces for antibodies to attach and either destroy or inhibit the virus' activity. Unfortunately, these recognition sites on HIV\nchange at a rapid rate because of mutations, making an effective vaccine against the virus very difficult, as the virus evolves and\nadapts. A person infected with HIV will quickly develop different populations, or variants, of the virus that differences in these\nrecognition sites distinguish. This rapid change of surface markers decreases the effectiveness of the person\u2019s immune system in\nattacking the virus, because the antibodies will not recognize the surface patterns' new variations. In the case of HIV, the\nproblem is compounded because the virus specifically infects and destroys cells involved in the immune response, further\nincapacitating the host.\n132\nChapter 5 \u2022 Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 5.6 HIV binds to the CD4 receptor, a glycoprotein on T cell surfaces. (credit: modification of work by NIH, NIAID)\nMembrane Fluidity\nThe membrane's mosaic characteristic helps to illustrate its nature. The integral proteins and lipids exist in the membrane as\nseparate but loosely attached molecules. These resemble the separate, multicolored tiles of a mosaic picture, and they float,\nmoving somewhat with respect to one another. The membrane is not like a balloon, however, that can expand and contract;\nrather, it is fairly rigid and can burst if penetrated or if a cell takes in too much water. However, because of its mosaic nature, a\nvery fine needle can easily penetrate a plasma membrane without causing it to burst, and the membrane will flow and self-seal\nwhen one extracts the needle.\nThe membrane's mosaic characteristics explain some but not all of its fluidity. There are two other factors that help maintain this\nfluid characteristic. One factor is the nature of the phospholipids themselves. In their saturated form, the fatty acids in\nphospholipid tails are saturated with bound hydrogen atoms. There are no double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. This\nresults in tails that are relatively straight. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids do not contain a maximal number of hydrogen\natoms, but they do contain some double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. A double bond results in a bend in the carbon\nstring of approximately 30 degrees (Figure 5.3).\nThus, if decreasing temperatures compress saturated fatty acids with their straight tails, they press in on each other, making a\ndense and fairly rigid membrane. If unsaturated fatty acids are compressed, the \u201ckinks\u201d in their tails elbow adjacent\nphospholipid molecules away, maintaining some space between the phospholipid molecules. This \u201celbow room\u201d helps to\nmaintain fluidity in the membrane at temperatures at which membranes with saturated fatty acid tails in their phospholipids\nwould \u201cfreeze\u201d or solidify. The membrane's relative fluidity is particularly important in a cold environment. A cold environment\nusually compresses membranes comprised largely of saturated fatty acids, making them less fluid and more susceptible to\nrupturing. Many organisms (fish are one example) are capable of adapting to cold environments by changing the proportion of\nunsaturated fatty acids in their membranes in response to lower temperature.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/biological_memb) to see animations of the membranes' fluidity and mosaic quality.\n5.1 \u2022 Components and Structure\n133\nAnimals have an additional membrane constituent that assists in maintaining fluidity. Cholesterol, which lies alongside the\nphospholipids in the membrane, tends to dampen temperature effects on the membrane. Thus, this lipid functions as a buffer,\npreventing lower temperatures from inhibiting fluidity and preventing increased temperatures from increasing fluidity too\nmuch. Thus, cholesterol extends, in both directions, the temperature range in which the membrane is appropriately fluid and\nconsequently functional. Cholesterol also serves other functions, such as organizing clusters of transmembrane proteins into\nlipid rafts.\nPlasma Membrane Components and Functions\nComponent\nLocation\nPhospholipid\nMain membrane fabric\nCholesterol\nAttached between phospholipids and between the two phospholipid\nlayers\nIntegral proteins (for example, integrins)\nEmbedded within the phospholipid layer(s); may or may not penetrate\nthrough both layers\nPeripheral proteins\nOn the phospholipid bilayer's inner or outer surface; not embedded\nwithin the phospholipids\nCarbohydrates (components of glycoproteins\nand glycolipids)\nGenerally attached to proteins on the outside membrane layer\nTable 5.1\nCAREER CONNECTION\nImmunologist\nThe variations in peripheral proteins and carbohydrates that affect a cell\u2019s recognition sites are of prime interest in immunology.\nIn developing vaccines, researchers have been able to conquer many infectious diseases, such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and\ntetanus.\nImmunologists are the physicians and scientists who research and develop vaccines, as well as treat and study allergies or other\nimmune problems. Some immunologists study and treat autoimmune problems (diseases in which a person\u2019s immune system\nattacks his or her own cells or tissues, such as lupus) and immunodeficiencies, whether acquired (such as acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS) or hereditary (such as severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID). Immunologists\nalso help treat organ transplantation patients, who must have their immune systems suppressed so that their bodies will not\nreject a transplanted organ. Some immunologists work to understand natural immunity and the effects of a person\u2019s\nenvironment on it. Others work on questions about how the immune system affects diseases such as cancer. In the past,\nresearchers did not understand the importance of having a healthy immune system in preventing cancer.\nTo work as an immunologist, one must have a PhD or MD. In addition, immunologists undertake at least two to three years of\ntraining in an accredited program and must pass the American Board of Allergy and Immunology exam. Immunologists must\npossess knowledge of the human body's function as they relate to issues beyond immunization, and knowledge of\npharmacology and medical technology, such as medications, therapies, test materials, and surgical procedures.\n134\nChapter 5 \u2022 Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n5.2 Passive Transport\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain why and how passive transport occurs\n\u2022\nUnderstand the osmosis and diffusion processes\n\u2022\nDefine tonicity and its relevance to passive transport\nPlasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell, and prevent some harmful materials from entering\nand some essential materials from leaving. In other words, plasma membranes are selectively permeable\u2014they allow some\nsubstances to pass through, but not others. If they were to lose this selectivity, the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself,\nand it would be destroyed. Some cells require larger amounts of specific substances. They must have a way of obtaining these\nmaterials from extracellular fluids. This may happen passively, as certain materials move back and forth, or the cell may have\nspecial mechanisms that facilitate transport. Some materials are so important to a cell that it spends some of its energy,\nhydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to obtain these materials. Red blood cells use some of their energy doing just that.\nMost cells spend the majority of their energy to maintain an imbalance of sodium and potassium ions between the cell's interior\nand exterior, as well as on protein synthesis.\nThe most direct forms of membrane transport are passive. Passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not\nrequire the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement. In passive transport, substances move from an area of\nhigher concentration to an area of lower concentration. A physical space in which there is a single substance concentration\nrange has a concentration gradient.\nSelective Permeability\nPlasma membranes are asymmetric: the membrane's interior is not identical to its exterior. There is a considerable difference\nbetween the array of phospholipids and proteins between the two leaflets that form a membrane. On the membrane's interior,\nsome proteins serve to anchor the membrane to cytoskeleton's fibers. There are peripheral proteins on the membrane's exterior\nthat bind extracellular matrix elements. Carbohydrates, attached to lipids or proteins, are also on the plasma membrane's\nexterior surface. These carbohydrate complexes help the cell bind required substances in the extracellular fluid. This adds\nconsiderably to plasma membrane's selective nature (Figure 5.7).\nFigure 5.7 The plasma membrane's exterior surface is not identical to its interior surface.\nRecall that plasma membranes are amphiphilic: They have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. This characteristic helps move\nsome materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. Non-polar and lipid-soluble material with a low\nmolecular weight can easily slip through the membrane's hydrophobic lipid core. Substances such as the fat-soluble vitamins A,\nD, E, and K readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues. Fat-soluble drugs and\nhormones also gain easy entry into cells and readily transport themselves into the body\u2019s tissues and organs. Oxygen and carbon\n5.2 \u2022 Passive Transport\n135\ndioxide molecules have no charge and pass through membranes by simple diffusion.\nPolar substances present problems for the membrane. While some polar molecules connect easily with the cell's outside, they\ncannot readily pass through the plasma membrane's lipid core. Additionally, while small ions could easily slip through the spaces\nin the membrane's mosaic, their charge prevents them from doing so. Ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride\nmust have special means of penetrating plasma membranes. Simple sugars and amino acids also need the help of various\ntransmembrane proteins (channels) to transport themselves across plasma membranes.\nDiffusion\nDiffusion is a passive process of transport. A single substance moves from a high concentration to a low concentration area until\nthe concentration is equal across a space. You are familiar with diffusion of substances through the air. For example, think about\nsomeone opening a bottle of ammonia in a room filled with people. The ammonia gas is at its highest concentration in the\nbottle. Its lowest concentration is at the room's edges. The ammonia vapor will diffuse, or spread away, from the bottle, and\ngradually, increasingly more people will smell the ammonia as it spreads. Materials move within the cell\u2019s cytosol by diffusion,\nand certain materials move through the plasma membrane by diffusion (Figure 5.8). Diffusion expends no energy. On the\ncontrary, concentration gradients are a form of potential energy, which dissipates as the gradient is eliminated.\nFigure 5.8 Diffusion through a permeable membrane moves a substance from a high concentration area (extracellular fluid, in this case)\ndown its concentration gradient (into the cytoplasm). (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nEach separate substance in a medium, such as the extracellular fluid, has its own concentration gradient, independent of other\nmaterials' concentration gradients. In addition, each substance will diffuse according to that gradient. Within a system, there\nwill be different diffusion rates of various substances in the medium.\nFactors That Affect Diffusion\nMolecules move constantly in a random manner, at a rate that depends on their mass, their environment, and the amount of\nthermal energy they possess, which in turn is a function of temperature. This movement accounts for molecule diffusion\nthrough whatever medium in which they are localized. A substance moves into any space available to it until it evenly distributes\nitself throughout. After a substance has diffused completely through a space, removing its concentration gradient, molecules\nwill still move around in the space, but there will be no net movement of the number of molecules from one area to another. We\ncall this lack of a concentration gradient in which the substance has no net movement dynamic equilibrium. While diffusion will\ngo forward in the presence of a substance's concentration gradient, several factors affect the diffusion rate.\n\u2022\nExtent of the concentration gradient: The greater the difference in concentration, the more rapid the diffusion. The closer\nthe distribution of the material gets to equilibrium, the slower the diffusion rate.\n\u2022\nMass of the molecules diffusing: Heavier molecules move more slowly; therefore, they diffuse more slowly. The reverse is\ntrue for lighter molecules.\n\u2022\nTemperature: Higher temperatures increase the energy and therefore the molecules' movement, increasing the diffusion\nrate. Lower temperatures decrease the molecules' energy, thus decreasing the diffusion rate.\n\u2022\nSolvent density: As the density of a solvent increases, the diffusion rate decreases. The molecules slow down because they\n136\nChapter 5 \u2022 Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nhave a more difficult time passing through the denser medium. If the medium is less dense, diffusion increases. Because\ncells primarily use diffusion to move materials within the cytoplasm, any increase in the cytoplasm\u2019s density will inhibit the\nmovement of the materials. An example of this is a person experiencing dehydration. As the body\u2019s cells lose water, the\ndiffusion rate decreases in the cytoplasm, and the cells\u2019 functions deteriorate. Neurons tend to be very sensitive to this\neffect. Dehydration frequently leads to unconsciousness and possibly coma because of the decrease in diffusion rate within\nthe cells.\n\u2022\nSolubility: As we discussed earlier, nonpolar or lipid-soluble materials pass through plasma membranes more easily than\npolar materials, allowing a faster diffusion rate.\n\u2022\nSurface area and plasma membrane thickness: Increased surface area increases the diffusion rate; whereas, a thicker\nmembrane reduces it.\n\u2022\nDistance travelled: The greater the distance that a substance must travel, the slower the diffusion rate. This places an upper\nlimitation on cell size. A large, spherical cell will die because nutrients or waste cannot reach or leave the cell's center,\nrespectively. Therefore, cells must either be small in size, as in the case of many prokaryotes, or be flattened, as with many\nsingle-celled eukaryotes.\nA variation of diffusion is the process of filtration. In filtration, material moves according to its concentration gradient through\na membrane. Sometimes pressure enhances the diffusion rate, causing the substances to filter more rapidly. This occurs in the\nkidney, where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances, or solutes, out of the blood\nand into the renal tubules. The diffusion rate in this instance is almost totally dependent on pressure. One of the effects of high\nblood pressure is the appearance of protein in the urine, which abnormally high pressure \"squeezes through\".\nFacilitated transport\nIn facilitated transport, or facilitated diffusion, materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help of membrane\nproteins. A concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell without expending cellular\nenergy. However, these materials are polar molecule ions that the cell membrane's hydrophobic parts repel. Facilitated transport\nproteins shield these materials from the membrane's repulsive force, allowing them to diffuse into the cell.\nThe transported material first attaches to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the plasma membrane's exterior surface. This\nallows removal of material from the extracellular fluid that the cell needs. The substances then pass to specific integral proteins\nthat facilitate their passage. Some of these integral proteins are collections of beta-pleated sheets that form a pore or channel\nthrough the phospholipid bilayer. Others are carrier proteins which bind with the substance and aid its diffusion through the\nmembrane.\nChannels\nThe integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are transport proteins, and they function as either channels for the\nmaterial or carriers. In both cases, they are transmembrane proteins. Channels are specific for the transported substance.\nChannel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids. In addition, they have a\nhydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening through the membrane layers (Figure 5.9). Passage\nthrough the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the plasma membrane's nonpolar central layer that would otherwise slow\nor prevent their entry into the cell. Aquaporins are channel proteins that allow water to pass through the membrane at a very\nhigh rate.\n5.2 \u2022 Passive Transport\n137\nFigure 5.9 Facilitated transport moves substances down their concentration gradients. They may cross the plasma membrane with the aid\nof channel proteins. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nChannel proteins are either open at all times or they are \u201cgated,\u201d which controls the channel's opening. When a particular ion\nattaches to the channel protein it may control the opening, or other mechanisms or substances may be involved. In some\ntissues, sodium and chloride ions pass freely through open channels; whereas, in other tissues a gate must open to allow\npassage. An example of this occurs in the kidney, where there are both channel forms in different parts of the renal tubules. Cells\ninvolved in transmitting electrical impulses, such as nerve and muscle cells, have gated channels for sodium, potassium, and\ncalcium in their membranes. Opening and closing these channels changes the relative concentrations on opposing sides of the\nmembrane of these ions, resulting in facilitating electrical transmission along membranes (in the case of nerve cells) or in\nmuscle contraction (in the case of muscle cells).\nCarrier Proteins\nAnother type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein. This aptly named protein binds a substance\nand, thus triggers a change of its own shape, moving the bound molecule from the cell's outside to its interior (Figure 5.10).\nDepending on the gradient, the material may move in the opposite direction. Carrier proteins are typically specific for a single\nsubstance. This selectivity adds to the plasma membrane's overall selectivity. Scientists poorly understand the exact mechanism\nfor the change of shape. Proteins can change shape when their hydrogen bonds are affected, but this may not fully explain this\nmechanism. Each carrier protein is specific to one substance, and there are a finite number of these proteins in any membrane.\nThis can cause problems in transporting enough material for the cell to function properly. When all of the proteins are bound to\ntheir ligands, they are saturated and the rate of transport is at its maximum. Increasing the concentration gradient at this point\nwill not result in an increased transport rate.\n138\nChapter 5 \u2022 Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 5.10 Some substances are able to move down their concentration gradient across the plasma membrane with the aid of carrier\nproteins. Carrier proteins change shape as they move molecules across the membrane. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz\nVillareal)\nAn example of this process occurs in the kidney. In one part, the kidney filters glucose, water, salts, ions, and amino acids that\nthe body requires. This filtrate, which includes glucose, then reabsorbs in another part of the kidney. Because there are only a\nfinite number of carrier proteins for glucose, if more glucose is present than the proteins can handle, the excess is not\ntransported and the body excretes this through urine. In a diabetic individual, the term is \u201cspilling glucose into the urine.\u201d A\ndifferent group of carrier proteins, glucose transport proteins, or GLUTs, are involved in transporting glucose and other hexose\nsugars through plasma membranes within the body.\nChannel and carrier proteins transport material at different rates. Channel proteins transport much more quickly than carrier\nproteins. Channel proteins facilitate diffusion at a rate of tens of millions of molecules per second; whereas, carrier proteins\nwork at a rate of a thousand to a million molecules per second.\nOsmosis\nOsmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the water's concentration gradient across\nthe membrane, which is inversely proportional to the solutes' concentration. While diffusion transports material across\nmembranes and within cells, osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the solutes' diffusion\nin the water. Not surprisingly, the aquaporins that facilitate water movement play a large role in osmosis, most prominently in\nred blood cells and the membranes of kidney tubules.\nMechanism\nOsmosis is a special case of diffusion. Water, like other substances, moves from an area of high concentration to one of low\nconcentration. An obvious question is what makes water move at all? Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane\nseparating the two sides or halves (Figure 5.11). On both sides of the membrane the water level is the same, but there are\ndifferent dissolved substance concentrations, or solute, that cannot cross the membrane (otherwise the solute crossing the\nmembrane would balance concentrations on each side). If the solution's volume on both sides of the membrane is the same, but\nthe solute's concentrations are different, then there are different amounts of water, the solvent, on either side of the membrane.\n5.2 \u2022 Passive Transport\n139\nFigure 5.11 In osmosis, water always moves from an area of higher water concentration to one of lower concentration. In the diagram, the\nsolute cannot pass through the selectively permeable membrane, but the water can.\nTo illustrate this, imagine two full water glasses. One has a single teaspoon of sugar in it; whereas, the second one contains one-\nquarter cup of sugar. If the total volume of the solutions in both cups is the same, which cup contains more water? Because the\nlarge sugar amount in the second cup takes up much more space than the teaspoon of sugar in the first cup, the first cup has\nmore water in it.\nReturning to the beaker example, recall that it has a solute mixture on either side of the membrane. A principle of diffusion is\nthat the molecules move around and will spread evenly throughout the medium if they can. However, only the material capable\nof getting through the membrane will diffuse through it. In this example, the solute cannot diffuse through the membrane, but\nthe water can. Water has a concentration gradient in this system. Thus, water will diffuse down its concentration gradient,\ncrossing the membrane to the side where it is less concentrated. This diffusion of water through the membrane\u2014osmosis\u2014will\ncontinue until the water's concentration gradient goes to zero or until the water's hydrostatic pressure balances the osmotic\npressure. Osmosis proceeds constantly in living systems.\nTonicity\nTonicity describes how an extracellular solution can change a cell's volume by affecting osmosis. A solution's tonicity often\ndirectly correlates with the solution's osmolarity. Osmolarity describes the solution's total solute concentration. A solution with\nlow osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of solute particles. A solution with high\nosmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles. In a situation in which a membrane permeable to water,\nthough not to the solute separates two different osmolarities, water will move from the membrane's side with lower osmolarity\n(and more water) to the side with higher osmolarity (and less water). This effect makes sense if you remember that the solute\ncannot move across the membrane, and thus the only component in the system that can move\u2014the water\u2014moves along its own\nconcentration gradient. An important distinction that concerns living systems is that osmolarity measures the number of\nparticles (which may be molecules) in a solution. Therefore, a solution that is cloudy with cells may have a lower osmolarity than\na solution that is clear, if the second solution contains more dissolved molecules than there are cells.\nHypotonic Solutions\nScientists use three terms\u2014hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic\u2014to relate the cell's osmolarity to the extracellular fluid's\nosmolarity that contains the cells. In a hypotonic situation, the extracellular fluid has lower osmolarity than the fluid inside the\ncell, and water enters the cell. (In living systems, the point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so the prefix hypo- means that\nthe extracellular fluid has a lower solute concentration, or a lower osmolarity, than the cell cytoplasm.) It also means that the\nextracellular fluid has a higher water concentration in the solution than does the cell. In this situation, water will follow its\nconcentration gradient and enter the cell.\nHypertonic Solutions\nAs for a hypertonic solution, the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cell\u2019s\ncytoplasm; therefore, the fluid contains less water than the cell does. Because the cell has a relatively higher water concentration,\nwater will leave the cell.\nIsotonic Solutions\nIn an isotonic solution, the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell. If the cell's osmolarity matches that of the\nextracellular fluid, there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell, although water will still move in and out. Blood\n140\nChapter 5 \u2022 Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncells and plant cells in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions take on characteristic appearances (Figure 5.12).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 5.12 Osmotic pressure changes red blood cells' shape in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions. (credit: Mariana Ruiz\nVillareal)\nA doctor injects a patient with what the doctor thinks is an isotonic saline solution. The patient dies, and an autopsy reveals that\nmany red blood cells have been destroyed. Do you think the solution the doctor injected was really isotonic?\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor a video illustrating the diffusion process in solutions, visit this site (http://openstax.org/l/dispersion) .\nTonicity in Living Systems\nIn a hypotonic environment, water enters a cell, and the cell swells. In an isotonic condition, the relative solute and solvent\nconcentrations are equal on both membrane sides. There is no net water movement; therefore, there is no change in the cell's\nsize. In a hypertonic solution, water leaves a cell and the cell shrinks. If either the hypo- or hyper- condition goes to excess, the\ncell\u2019s functions become compromised, and the cell may be destroyed.\nA red blood cell will burst, or lyse, when it swells beyond the plasma membrane\u2019s capability to expand. Remember, the\nmembrane resembles a mosaic, with discrete spaces between the molecules comprising it. If the cell swells, and the spaces\nbetween the lipids and proteins become too large, the cell will break apart.\nIn contrast, when excessive water amounts leave a red blood cell, the cell shrinks, or crenates. This has the effect of\nconcentrating the solutes left in the cell, making the cytosol denser and interfering with diffusion within the cell. The cell\u2019s\nability to function will be compromised and may also result in the cell's death.\nVarious living things have ways of controlling the effects of osmosis\u2014a mechanism we call osmoregulation. Some organisms,\nsuch as plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists, have cell walls that surround the plasma membrane and prevent cell lysis in a\nhypotonic solution. The plasma membrane can only expand to the cell wall's limit, so the cell will not lyse. The cytoplasm in\nplants is always slightly hypertonic to the cellular environment, and water will always enter a cell if water is available. This water\ninflow produces turgor pressure, which stiffens the plant's cell walls (Figure 5.13). In nonwoody plants, turgor pressure supports\nthe plant. Conversly, if you do not water the plant, the extracellular fluid will become hypertonic, causing water to leave the cell.\nIn this condition, the cell does not shrink because the cell wall is not flexible. However, the cell membrane detaches from the wall\nand constricts the cytoplasm. We call this plasmolysis. Plants lose turgor pressure in this condition and wilt (Figure 5.14).\n5.2 \u2022 Passive Transport\n141\nFigure 5.13 The turgor pressure within a plant cell depends on the solution's tonicity in which it is bathed. (credit: modification of work by\nMariana Ruiz Villareal)\nFigure 5.14 Without adequate water, the plant on the left has lost turgor pressure, visible in its wilting. Watering the plant (right) will restore\nthe turgor pressure. (credit: Victor M. Vicente Selvas)\nTonicity is a concern for all living things. For example, paramecia and amoebas, which are protists that lack cell walls, have\ncontractile vacuoles. This vesicle collects excess water from the cell and pumps it out, keeping the cell from lysing as it takes on\nwater from its environment (Figure 5.15).\nFigure 5.15 A paramecium\u2019s contractile vacuole, here visualized using bright field light microscopy at 480x magnification, continuously\npumps water out of the organism\u2019s body to keep it from bursting in a hypotonic medium. (credit: modification of work by NIH; scale-bar\ndata from Matt Russell)\nMany marine invertebrates have internal salt levels matched to their environments, making them isotonic with the water in\nwhich they live. Fish, however, must spend approximately five percent of their metabolic energy maintaining osmotic\nhomeostasis. Freshwater fish live in an environment that is hypotonic to their cells. These fish actively take in salt through their\ngills and excrete diluted urine to rid themselves of excess water. Saltwater fish live in the reverse environment, which is\nhypertonic to their cells, and they secrete salt through their gills and excrete highly concentrated urine.\nIn vertebrates, the kidneys regulate the water amount in the body. Osmoreceptors are specialized cells in the brain that monitor\nsolute concentration in the blood. If the solute levels increase beyond a certain range, a hormone releases that slows water loss\nthrough the kidney and dilutes the blood to safer levels. Animals also have high albumin concentrations, which the liver\nproduces, in their blood. This protein is too large to pass easily through plasma membranes and is a major factor in controlling\n142\nChapter 5 \u2022 Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthe osmotic pressures applied to tissues.\n5.3 Active Transport\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nUnderstand how electrochemical gradients affect ions\n\u2022\nDistinguish between primary active transport and secondary active transport\nActive transport mechanisms require the cell\u2019s energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). If a substance must\nmove into the cell against its concentration gradient\u2014that is, if the substance's concentration inside the cell is greater than its\nconcentration in the extracellular fluid (and vice versa)\u2014the cell must use energy to move the substance. Some active transport\nmechanisms move small-molecular weight materials, such as ions, through the membrane. Other mechanisms transport much\nlarger molecules.\nElectrochemical Gradient\nWe have discussed simple concentration gradients\u2014a substance's differential concentrations across a space or a\nmembrane\u2014but in living systems, gradients are more complex. Because ions move into and out of cells and because cells\ncontain proteins that do not move across the membrane and are mostly negatively charged, there is also an electrical gradient, a\ndifference of charge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the\nextracellular fluid in which they are bathed, and at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K+) and lower\nconcentrations of sodium (Na+) than the extracellular fluid. Thus in a living cell, the concentration gradient of Na+ tends to drive\nit into the cell, and its electrical gradient (a positive ion) also drives it inward to the negatively charged interior. However, the\nsituation is more complex for other elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of K+, a positive ion, also drives it into\nthe cell, but the concentration gradient of K+ drives K+ out of the cell (Figure 5.16). We call the combined concentration gradient\nand electrical charge that affects an ion its electrochemical gradient.\n5.3 \u2022 Active Transport\n143\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 5.16 Electrochemical gradients arise from the combined effects of concentration gradients and electrical gradients. Structures\nlabeled A represent proteins. (credit: \u201cSynaptitude\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nInjecting a potassium solution into a person\u2019s blood is lethal. This is how capital punishment and euthanasia subjects die. Why\ndo you think a potassium solution injection is lethal?\nMoving Against a Gradient\nTo move substances against a concentration or electrochemical gradient, the cell must use energy. This energy comes from ATP\ngenerated through the cell\u2019s metabolism. Active transport mechanisms, or pumps, work against electrochemical gradients.\nSmall substances constantly pass through plasma membranes. Active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other\nsubstances that living cells require in the face of these passive movements. A cell may spend much of its metabolic energy supply\nmaintaining these processes. (A red blood cell uses most of its metabolic energy to maintain the imbalance between exterior and\ninterior sodium and potassium levels that the cell requires.) Because active transport mechanisms depend on a cell\u2019s metabolism\nfor energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the ATP supply.\nTwo mechanisms exist for transporting small-molecular weight material and small molecules. Primary active transport moves\nions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane, which is directly dependent on ATP.\nSecondary active transport does not directly require ATP: instead, it is the movement of material due to the electrochemical\ngradient established by primary active transport.\nCarrier Proteins for Active Transport\nAn important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate\nmovement: there are three protein types or transporters (Figure 5.17). A uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule. A\nsymporter carries two different ions or molecules, both in the same direction. An antiporter also carries two different ions or\nmolecules, but in different directions. All of these transporters can also transport small, uncharged organic molecules like\nglucose. These three types of carrier proteins are also in facilitated diffusion, but they do not require ATP to work in that\n144\nChapter 5 \u2022 Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nprocess. Some examples of pumps for active transport are Na+-K+ ATPase, which carries sodium and potassium ions, and H+-K+\nATPase, which carries hydrogen and potassium ions. Both of these are antiporter carrier proteins. Two other carrier proteins are\nCa2+ ATPase and H+ ATPase, which carry only calcium and only hydrogen ions, respectively. Both are pumps.\nFigure 5.17 A uniporter carries one molecule or ion. A symporter carries two different molecules or ions, both in the same direction. An\nantiporter also carries two different molecules or ions, but in different directions. (credit: modification of work by \u201cLupask\u201d/Wikimedia\nCommons)\nPrimary Active Transport\nThe primary active transport that functions with the active transport of sodium and potassium allows secondary active\ntransport to occur. The second transport method is still active because it depends on using energy as does primary transport\n(Figure 5.18).\nFigure 5.18 Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient (electrogenic transport). (credit:\nmodification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nOne of the most important pumps in animal cells is the sodium-potassium pump (Na+-K+ ATPase), which maintains the\nelectrochemical gradient (and the correct concentrations of Na+ and K+) in living cells. The sodium-potassium pump moves K+\ninto the cell while moving Na+ out at the same time, at a ratio of three Na+ for every two K+ ions moved in. The Na+-K+ ATPase\nexists in two forms, depending on its orientation to the cell's interior or exterior and its affinity for either sodium or potassium\nions. The process consists of the following six steps.\n1.\nWith the enzyme oriented towards the cell's interior, the carrier has a high affinity for sodium ions. Three ions bind to the\nprotein.\n2.\nThe protein carrier hydrolyzes ATP and a low-energy phosphate group attaches to it.\n3.\nAs a result, the carrier changes shape and reorients itself towards the membrane's exterior. The protein\u2019s affinity for sodium\ndecreases and the three sodium ions leave the carrier.\n4.\nThe shape change increases the carrier\u2019s affinity for potassium ions, and two such ions attach to the protein. Subsequently,\nthe low-energy phosphate group detaches from the carrier.\n5.\nWith the phosphate group removed and potassium ions attached, the carrier protein repositions itself towards the cell's\n5.3 \u2022 Active Transport\n145\ninterior.\n6.\nThe carrier protein, in its new configuration, has a decreased affinity for potassium, and the two ions moves into the\ncytoplasm. The protein now has a higher affinity for sodium ions, and the process starts again.\nSeveral things have happened as a result of this process. At this point, there are more sodium ions outside the cell than inside\nand more potassium ions inside than out. For every three sodium ions that move out, two potassium ions move in. This results\nin the interior being slightly more negative relative to the exterior. This difference in charge is important in creating the\nconditions necessary for the secondary process. The sodium-potassium pump is, therefore, an electrogenic pump (a pump that\ncreates a charge imbalance), creating an electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video (https://openstax.org/l/Na_K_ATPase) to see an active transport simulation in a sodium-potassium ATPase.\nSecondary Active Transport (Co-transport)\nSecondary active transport brings sodium ions, and possibly other compounds, into the cell. As sodium ion concentrations build\noutside of the plasma membrane because of the primary active transport process, this creates an electrochemical gradient. If a\nchannel protein exists and is open, the sodium ions will pull through the membrane. This movement transports other\nsubstances that can attach themselves to the transport protein through the membrane (Figure 5.19). Many amino acids, as well\nas glucose, enter a cell this way. This secondary process also stores high-energy hydrogen ions in the mitochondria of plant and\nanimal cells in order to produce ATP. The potential energy that accumulates in the stored hydrogen ions translates into kinetic\nenergy as the ions surge through the channel protein ATP synthase, and that energy then converts ADP into ATP.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 5.19 An electrochemical gradient, which primary active transport creates, can move other substances against their concentration\ngradients, a process scientists call co-transport or secondary active transport.

Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular microorganisms. You might\nhave correctly hypothesized that when a cell uptakes and releases large particles, it requires energy. A large particle, however,\ncannot pass through the membrane, even with energy that the cell supplies.\nEndocytosis\nEndocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even whole cells, into a\ncell. There are different endocytosis variations, but all share a common characteristic: the cell's plasma membrane invaginates,\nforming a pocket around the target particle. The pocket pinches off, resulting in the particle containing itself in a newly created\nintracellular vesicle formed from the plasma membrane.\nPhagocytosis\nPhagocytosis (the condition of \u201ccell eating\u201d) is the process by which a cell takes in large particles, such as other cells or relatively\nlarge particles. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell, a neutrophil, will remove\nthe invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which the neutrophil then destroys (Figure\n5.20).\nFigure 5.20 In phagocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds the particle and engulfs it. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz\nVillareal)\nIn preparation for phagocytosis, a portion of the plasma membrane's inward-facing surface becomes coated with the protein\nclathrin, which stabilizes this membrane's section. The membrane's coated portion then extends from the cell's body and\nsurrounds the particle, eventually enclosing it. Once the vesicle containing the particle is enclosed within the cell, the clathrin\ndisengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome for breaking down the material in the newly formed\ncompartment (endosome). When accessible nutrients from the vesicular contents' degradation have been extracted, the newly\nformed endosome merges with the plasma membrane and releases its contents into the extracellular fluid. The endosomal\nmembrane again becomes part of the plasma membrane.\n5.4 \u2022 Bulk Transport\n147\nPinocytosis\nA variation of endocytosis is pinocytosis. This literally means \u201ccell drinking\u201d. Discovered by Warren Lewis in 1929, this American\nembryologist and cell biologist described a process whereby he assumed that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular\nfluid. In reality, this is a process that takes in molecules, including water, which the cell needs from the extracellular fluid.\nPinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than does phagocytosis, and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome\n(Figure 5.21).\nFigure 5.21 In pinocytosis, the cell membrane invaginates, surrounds a small volume of fluid, and pinches off. (credit: modification of work\nby Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nA variation of pinocytosis is potocytosis. This process uses a coating protein, caveolin, on the plasma membrane's cytoplasmic\nside, which performs a similar function to clathrin. The cavities in the plasma membrane that form the vacuoles have membrane\nreceptors and lipid rafts in addition to caveolin. The vacuoles or vesicles formed in caveolae (singular caveola) are smaller than\nthose in pinocytosis. Potocytosis brings small molecules into the cell and transports them through the cell for their release on\nthe other side, a process we call transcytosis.\nReceptor-mediated Endocytosis\nA targeted variation of endocytosis employs receptor proteins in the plasma membrane that have a specific binding affinity for\ncertain substances (Figure 5.22).\n148\nChapter 5 \u2022 Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 5.22 In receptor-mediated endocytosis, the cell's uptake of substances targets a single type of substance that binds to the receptor\non the cell membrane's external surface. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nIn receptor-mediated endocytosis, as in phagocytosis, clathrin attaches to the plasma membrane's cytoplasmic side. If a\ncompound's uptake is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will not be\nremoved from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. The failure of\nreceptor-mediated endocytosis causes some human diseases. For example, receptor mediated endocytosis removes low density\nlipoprotein or LDL (or \"bad\" cholesterol) from the blood. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL\nreceptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood,\nbecause their cells cannot clear LDL particles.\nAlthough receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally in the extracellular fluid into\nthe cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site. Flu viruses, diphtheria, and cholera toxin all have sites\nthat cross-react with normal receptor-binding sites and gain entry into cells.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSee receptor-mediated endocytosis in action, and click on different parts (http://openstax.org/l/endocytosis) for a focused\nanimation.\nExocytosis\nThe reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis. Exocytosis is the opposite of the processes we\ndiscussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid. Waste material is enveloped in a\nmembrane and fuses with the plasma membrane's interior. This fusion opens the membranous envelope on the cell's exterior,\nand the waste material expels into the extracellular space (Figure 5.23). Other examples of cells releasing molecules via\nexocytosis include extracellular matrix protein secretion and neurotransmitter secretion into the synaptic cleft by synaptic\n5.4 \u2022 Bulk Transport\n149\nvesicles.\nFigure 5.23 In exocytosis, vesicles containing substances fuse with the plasma membrane.

A phospholipid bilayer comprises the plasma\nmembrane, with hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with\neach other. The membrane's landscape is studded with\nproteins, some which span the membrane. Some of these\nproteins serve to transport materials into or out of the cell.\nCarbohydrates are attached to some of the proteins and\nlipids on the membrane's outward-facing surface, forming\ncomplexes that function to identify the cell to other cells. The\nmembrane's fluid nature is due to temperature, fatty acid tail\nconfiguration (some kinked by double bonds), cholesterol\npresence embedded in the membrane, and the mosaic\nnature of the proteins and protein-carbohydrate\ncombinations, which are not firmly fixed in place. Plasma\nmembranes enclose and define the cells' borders. Not static,\nthey are dynamic and constantly in flux.\n5.2 Passive Transport\nThe passive transport forms, diffusion and osmosis, move\nmaterials of small molecular weight across membranes.\nSubstances diffuse from high to lower concentration areas,\nand this process continues until the substance evenly\ndistributes itself in a system. In solutions containing more\nthan one substance, each molecule type diffuses according to\nits own concentration gradient, independent of other\nsubstances diffusing. Many factors can affect the diffusion\nrate, such as concentration gradient, diffusing, particle\nsizes, and the system's temperature.\nIn living systems, the plasma membrane mediates\nsubstances diffusing in and out of cells. Some materials\ndiffuse readily through the membrane, but others are\nhindered and only can pass through due to specialized\nproteins such as channels and transporters. The chemistry of\nliving things occurs in aqueous solutions, and balancing the\nconcentrations of those solutions is an ongoing problem. In\nliving systems, diffusing some substances would be slow or\ndifficult without membrane proteins that facilitate\ntransport.\n5.3 Active Transport\nThe combined gradient that affects an ion includes its\nconcentration gradient and its electrical gradient. A positive\nion, for example, might diffuse into a new area, down its\nconcentration gradient, but if it is diffusing into an area of\nnet positive charge, its electrical gradient hampers its\ndiffusion. When dealing with ions in aqueous solutions, one\nmust consider electrochemical and concentration gradient\ncombinations, rather than just the concentration gradient\nalone. Living cells need certain substances that exist inside\nthe cell in concentrations greater than they exist in the\nextracellular space. Moving substances up their\nelectrochemical gradients requires energy from the cell.\nActive transport uses energy stored in ATP to fuel this\ntransport. Active transport of small molecular-sized\nmaterials uses integral proteins in the cell membrane to\nmove the materials. These proteins are analogous to pumps.\nSome pumps, which carry out primary active transport,\ncouple directly with ATP to drive their action. In co-\ntransport (or secondary active transport), energy from\nprimary transport can move another substance into the cell\nand up its concentration gradient.\n5.4 Bulk Transport\nActive transport methods require directly using ATP to fuel\nthe transport. In a process scientists call phagocytosis, other\ncells can engulf large particles, such as macromolecules, cell\nparts, or whole cells. In phagocytosis, a portion of the\nmembrane invaginates and flows around the particle,\neventually pinching off and leaving the particle entirely\nenclosed by a plasma membrane's envelope. The cell breaks\ndown vesicle contents, with the particles either used as food\nor dispatched. Pinocytosis is a similar process on a smaller\nscale. The plasma membrane invaginates and pinches off,\nproducing a small envelope of fluid from outside the cell.\nPinocytosis imports substances that the cell needs from the\nextracellular fluid. The cell expels waste in a similar but\nreverse manner. It pushes a membranous vacuole to the\nplasma membrane, allowing the vacuole to fuse with the\nmembrane and incorporate itself into the membrane\nstructure, releasing its contents to the exterior.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

The flight muscles in birds are extremely efficient in energy production.\n(credit: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\nINTRODUCTION Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires energy. Organisms\nrequire energy to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use considerable energy while\nthinking, and even during sleep. Every organism's living cells constantly use energy. Organisms import\nnutrients and other molecules. They metabolize (break down) and possibly synthesize into new\nmolecules. If necessary, molecules modify, move around the cell and may distribute themselves to the\nentire organism. For example, the large proteins that make up muscles are actively built from smaller\nmolecules. Complex carbohydrates break down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as\nenergy is required to both build and demolish a building, energy is required to synthesize and break\ndown molecules. Additionally, signaling molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters transport\nbetween cells. Cells ingest and break down bacteria and viruses. Cells must also export waste and toxins\nto stay healthy, and many cells must swim or move surrounding materials via the beating motion of\ncellular appendages like cilia and flagella.\nThe cellular processes that we listed above require a steady supply of energy. From where, and in what\nform, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain energy, and how do they use it? This chapter will\ndiscuss different forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer. This chapter will also\ndescribe how cells use energy and replenish it, and how chemical reactions in the cell perform with great\nefficiency.\nChapter Outline\n6.1 Energy and\nMetabolism\n6.2 Potential, Kinetic,\nFree, and Activation\nEnergy\n6.3 The Laws of\nThermodynamics\n6.4 ATP: Adenosine\nTriphosphate\n6.5 Enzymes\nScientists use the term bioenergetics to discuss the concept of energy flow (Figure 6.2) through living\nsystems, such as cells. Cellular processes such as building and breaking down complex molecules occur\nthrough stepwise chemical reactions. Some of these chemical reactions are spontaneous and release energy;\nwhereas, others require energy to proceed. Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish\nwhat they have used, cells must continually obtain more energy to replenish that which the many energy-\nrequiring chemical reactions that constantly take place use. All of the chemical reactions that transpire\ninside cells, including those that use and release energy, are the cell\u2019s metabolism.\nFigure 6.2 Most life forms on earth obtain their energy from the sun. Plants use photosynthesis to capture sunlight,\nand herbivores eat those plants to obtain energy. Carnivores eat the herbivores, and decomposers digest plant and\nanimal matter.\nCarbohydrate Metabolism\nSugar (a simple carbohydrate) metabolism (chemical reactions) is a classic example of the many cellular\nprocesses that use and produce energy. Living things consume sugar as a major energy source, because\nsugar molecules have considerable energy stored within their bonds. The following equation describes the\nbreakdown of glucose, a simple sugar:\nConsumed carbohydrates have their origins in photosynthesizing organisms like plants (Figure 6.3). During\nphotosynthesis, plants use the energy of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide gas (CO2) into sugar molecules,\nlike glucose (C6H12O6). Because this process involves synthesizing a larger, energy-storing molecule, it\nrequires an energy input to proceed. The following equation (notice that it is the reverse of the previous\nequation) describes the synthesis of glucose:\nDuring photosynthesis chemical reactions, energy is in the form of a very high-energy molecule scientists\ncall ATP, or adenosine triphosphate. This is the primary energy currency of all cells. Just as the dollar is the\n156\nChapter 6 \u2022 Metabolism\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncurrency we use to buy goods, cells use ATP molecules as energy currency to perform immediate work. The sugar (glucose) is\nstored as starch or glycogen. Energy-storing polymers like these break down into glucose to supply ATP molecules.\nSolar energy is required to synthesize a glucose molecule during the photosynthesis reactions. In photosynthesis, light energy\nfrom the sun initially transforms into chemical energy that temporally stores itself in the energy carrier molecules ATP and\nNADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Photosynthesis later uses the stored energy in ATP and NADPH to\nbuild one glucose molecule from six molecules of CO2. This process is analogous to eating breakfast in the morning to acquire\nenergy for your body that you can use later in the day. Under ideal conditions, energy from 18 molecules of ATP is required to\nsynthesize one glucose molecule during photosynthesis reactions. Glucose molecules can also combine with and convert into\nother sugar types. When an organism consumes sugars, glucose molecules eventually make their way into each organism's living\ncell. Inside the cell, each sugar molecule breaks down through a complex series of chemical reactions. The goal of these reactions\nis to harvest the energy stored inside the sugar molecules. The harvested energy makes high-energy ATP molecules, which\nperform work, powering many chemical reactions in the cell. The amount of energy needed to make one glucose molecule from\nsix carbon dioxide molecules is 18 ATP molecules and 12 NADPH molecules (each one of which is energetically equivalent to\nthree ATP molecules), or a total of 54 molecule equivalents required for synthesizing one glucose molecule. This process is a\nfundamental and efficient way for cells to generate the molecular energy that they require.\nFigure 6.3 Plants, like this oak tree and acorn, use energy from sunlight to make sugar and other organic molecules. Both plants and\nanimals (like this squirrel) use cellular respiration to derive energy from the organic molecules that plants originally produced. (credit\n\u201cacorn\u201d: modification of work by Noel Reynolds; credit \u201csquirrel\u201d: modification of work by Dawn Huczek)\nMetabolic Pathways\nThe processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two types of metabolic pathways. A metabolic pathway is\na series of interconnected biochemical reactions that convert a substrate molecule or molecules, step-by-step, through a series\nof metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product or products. In the case of sugar metabolism, the first metabolic\npathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pathway broke sugar down into smaller molecules. Scientists\ncall these two opposite processes\u2014the first requiring energy and the second producing energy\u2014anabolic (building) and\ncatabolic (breaking down) pathways, respectively. Consequently, building (anabolism) and degradation (catabolism) comprise\nmetabolism.\n6.1 \u2022 Energy and Metabolism\n157\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nEvolution of Metabolic Pathways\nFigure 6.4 This tree shows the evolution of the various branches of life. The vertical dimension is time. Early life forms, in blue, used\nanaerobic metabolism to obtain energy from their surroundings.\nThere is more to the complexity of metabolism than understanding the metabolic pathways alone. Metabolic complexity varies\nfrom organism to organism. Photosynthesis is the primary pathway in which photosynthetic organisms like plants (planktonic\nalgae perform the majority of global photosynthesis) harvest the sun\u2019s energy and convert it into carbohydrates. The by-product\nof photosynthesis is oxygen, which some cells require to carry out cellular respiration. During cellular respiration, oxygen aids\nin the catabolic breakdown of carbon compounds, like carbohydrates. Among the products are CO2 and ATP. In addition, some\neukaryotes perform catabolic processes without oxygen (fermentation); that is, they perform or use anaerobic metabolism.\nOrganisms probably evolved anaerobic metabolism to survive (living organisms came into existence about 3.8 billion years ago,\nwhen the atmosphere lacked oxygen). Despite the differences between organisms and the complexity of metabolism,\nresearchers have found that all branches of life share some of the same metabolic pathways, suggesting that all organisms\nevolved from the same ancient common ancestor (Figure 6.4). Evidence indicates that over time, the pathways diverged, adding\nspecialized enzymes to allow organisms to better adapt to their environment, thus increasing their chance to survive. However,\nthe underlying principle remains that all organisms must harvest energy from their environment and convert it to ATP to carry\nout cellular functions.\nAnabolic and Catabolic Pathways\nAnabolic pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones. Synthesizing sugar from CO2\nis one example. Other examples are synthesizing large proteins from amino acid building blocks, and synthesizing new DNA\nstrands from nucleic acid building blocks. These biosynthetic processes are critical to the cell's life, take place constantly, and\ndemand energy that ATP and other high-energy molecules like NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADPH provide\n(Figure 6.5).\nATP is an important molecule for cells to have in sufficient supply at all times. The breakdown of sugars illustrates how a single\nglucose molecule can store enough energy to make a great deal of ATP, 36 to 38 molecules. This is a catabolic pathway. Catabolic\npathways involve degrading (or breaking down) complex molecules into simpler ones. Molecular energy stored in complex\nmolecule bonds release in catabolic pathways and harvest in such a way that it can produce ATP. Other energy-storing\nmolecules, such as fats, also break down through similar catabolic reactions to release energy and make ATP (Figure 6.5).\nIt is important to know that metabolic pathway chemical reactions do not take place spontaneously. A protein called an enzyme\nfacilitates or catalyzes each reaction step. Enzymes are important for catalyzing all types of biological reactions\u2014those that\nrequire energy as well as those that release energy.\n158\nChapter 6 \u2022 Metabolism\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 6.5 Anabolic pathways are those that require energy to synthesize larger molecules. Catabolic pathways are those that generate\nenergy by breaking down larger molecules. Both types of pathways are required for maintaining the cell\u2019s energy balance.\n6.2 Potential, Kinetic, Free, and Activation Energy\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDefine \u201cenergy\u201d\n\u2022\nExplain the difference between kinetic and potential energy\n\u2022\nDiscuss the concepts of free energy and activation energy\n\u2022\nDescribe endergonic and exergonic reactions\nWe define energy as the ability to do work. As you\u2019ve learned, energy exists in different forms. For example, electrical energy,\nlight energy, and heat energy are all different energy types. While these are all familiar energy types that one can see or feel,\nthere is another energy type that is much less tangible. Scientists associate this energy with something as simple as an object\nabove the ground. In order to appreciate the way energy flows into and out of biological systems, it is important to understand\nmore about the different energy types that exist in the physical world.\nEnergy Types\nWhen an object is in motion, there is energy. For example, an airplane in flight produces considerable energy. This is because\nmoving objects are capable of enacting a change, or doing work. Think of a wrecking ball. Even a slow-moving wrecking ball can\ndo considerable damage to other objects. However, a wrecking ball that is not in motion is incapable of performing work.\nEnergy with objects in motion is kinetic energy. A speeding bullet, a walking person, rapid molecule movement in the air\n(which produces heat), and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy.\nWhat if we lift that same motionless wrecking ball two stories above a car with a crane? If the suspended wrecking ball is\nunmoving, can we associate energy with it? The answer is yes. The suspended wrecking ball has associated energy that is\nfundamentally different from the kinetic energy of objects in motion. This energy form results from the potential for the\nwrecking ball to do work. If we release the ball it would do work. Because this energy type refers to the potential to do work, we\ncall it potential energy. Objects transfer their energy between kinetic and potential in the following way: As the wrecking ball\nhangs motionless, it has 0 kinetic and 100 percent potential energy. Once it releases, its kinetic energy begins to increase\nbecause it builds speed due to gravity. Simultaneously, as it nears the ground, it loses potential energy. Somewhere mid-fall it\nhas 50 percent kinetic and 50 percent potential energy. Just before it hits the ground, the ball has nearly lost its potential energy\nand has near-maximal kinetic energy. Other examples of potential energy include water's energy held behind a dam (Figure 6.6),\nor a person about to skydive from an airplane.\n6.2 \u2022 Potential, Kinetic, Free, and Activation Energy\n159\nFigure 6.6 Water behind a dam has potential energy. Moving water, such as in a waterfall or a rapidly flowing river, has kinetic energy.\n(credit \u201cdam\u201d: modification of work by \"Pascal\"/Flickr; credit \u201cwaterfall\u201d: modification of work by Frank Gualtieri)\nWe associate potential energy not only with the matter's location (such as a child sitting on a tree branch), but also with the\nmatter's structure. A spring on the ground has potential energy if it is compressed; so does a tautly pulled rubber band. The very\nexistence of living cells relies heavily on structural potential energy. On a chemical level, the bonds that hold the molecules'\natoms together have potential energy. Remember that anabolic cellular pathways require energy to synthesize complex\nmolecules from simpler ones, and catabolic pathways release energy when complex molecules break down. That certain\nchemical bonds' breakdown can release energy implies that those bonds have potential energy. In fact, there is potential energy\nstored within the bonds of all the food molecules we eat, which we eventually harness for use. This is because these bonds can\nrelease energy when broken. Scientists call the potential energy type that exists within chemical bonds that releases when those\nbonds break chemical energy (Figure 6.7). Chemical energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from food.\nBreaking the molecular bonds within fuel molecules brings about the energy's release.\nFigure 6.7 The molecules in gasoline contain chemical energy within the chemical bonds. This energy transforms into kinetic energy that\nallows a car to race on a racetrack.

How can we compare the energy that releases from\none reaction to that of another reaction? We use a measurement of free energy to quantitate these energy transfers. Scientists\ncall this free energy Gibbs free energy (abbreviated with the letter G) after Josiah Willard Gibbs, the scientist who developed the\nmeasurement. Recall that according to the second law of thermodynamics, all energy transfers involve losing some energy in an\nunusable form such as heat, resulting in entropy. Gibbs free energy specifically refers to the energy that takes place with a\nchemical reaction that is available after we account for entropy. In other words, Gibbs free energy is usable energy, or energy\nthat is available to do work.\nEvery chemical reaction involves a change in free energy, called delta G (\u2206G). We can calculate the change in free energy for any\nsystem that undergoes such a change, such as a chemical reaction. To calculate \u2206G, subtract the amount of energy lost to\nentropy (denoted as \u2206S) from the system's total energy change. Scientists call this total energy change in the system enthalpy\nand we denote it as \u2206H. The formula for calculating \u2206G is as follows, where the symbol T refers to absolute temperature in\nKelvin (degrees Celsius + 273):\nWe express a chemical reaction's standard free energy change as an amount of energy per mole of the reaction product (either in\nkilojoules or kilocalories, kJ/mol or kcal/mol; 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal) under standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions. We\ngenerally calculate standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions at pH 7.0 in biological systems, 25 degrees Celsius, and\n100 kilopascals (1 atm pressure), respectively. Note that cellular conditions vary considerably from these standard conditions,\nand so standard calculated \u2206G values for biological reactions will be different inside the cell.\nEndergonic Reactions and Exergonic Reactions\nIf energy releases during a chemical reaction, then the resulting value from the above equation will be a negative number. In\nother words, reactions that release energy have a \u2206G < 0. A negative \u2206G also means that the reaction's products have less free\nenergy than the reactants, because they gave off some free energy during the reaction. Scientists call reactions that have a\nnegative \u2206G and consequently release free energy exergonic reactions. Think: exergonic means energy is exiting the system. We\nalso refer to these reactions as spontaneous reactions, because they can occur without adding energy into the system.\nUnderstanding which chemical reactions are spontaneous and release free energy is extremely useful for biologists, because\nthese reactions can be harnessed to perform work inside the cell. We must draw an important distinction between the term\nspontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction that occurs immediately. Contrary to the everyday use of the term, a\nspontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs. Rusting iron is an example of a spontaneous reaction that\noccurs slowly, little by little, over time.\nIf a chemical reaction requires an energy input rather than releasing energy, then the \u2206G for that reaction will be a positive\nvalue. In this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants. Thus, we can think of the reactions' products as\nenergy-storing molecules. We call these chemical reactions endergonic reactions, and they are non-spontaneous. An\nendergonic reaction will not take place on its own without adding free energy.\nLet\u2019s revisit the example of the synthesis and breakdown of the food molecule, glucose. Remember that building complex\nmolecules, such as sugars, from simpler ones is an anabolic process and requires energy. Therefore, the chemical reactions\ninvolved in anabolic processes are endergonic reactions. Alternatively the catabolic process of breaking sugar down into simpler\nmolecules releases energy in a series of exergonic reactions. Like the rust example above, the sugar breakdown involves\nspontaneous reactions, but these reactions do not occur instantaneously. Figure 6.8 shows some other examples of endergonic\nand exergonic reactions. Later sections will provide more information about what else is required to make even spontaneous\nreactions happen more efficiently.\n6.2 \u2022 Potential, Kinetic, Free, and Activation Energy\n161\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 6.8 This figure shows some examples of endergonic processes (ones that require energy) and exergonic processes (ones that\nrelease energy). These include (a) a compost pile decomposing, (b) a chick developing from a fertilized egg, (c) sand art destruction, and (d)\na ball rolling down a hill. (credit a: modification of work by Natalie Maynor; credit b: modification of work by USDA; credit c: modification of\nwork by \u201cAthlex\u201d/Flickr; credit d: modification of work by Harry Malsch)\nLook at each of the processes, and decide if it is endergonic or exergonic. In each case, does enthalpy increase or decrease, and\ndoes entropy increase or decrease?\nAn important concept in studying metabolism and energy is that of chemical equilibrium. Most chemical reactions are\nreversible. They can proceed in both directions, releasing energy into their environment in one direction, and absorbing it from\nthe environment in the other direction (Figure 6.9). The same is true for the chemical reactions involved in cell metabolism, such\nas the breaking down and building up of proteins into and from individual amino acids, respectively. Reactants within a closed\nsystem will undergo chemical reactions in both directions until they reach a state of equilibrium, which is one of the lowest\npossible free energy and a state of maximal entropy. To push the reactants and products away from a state of equilibrium\nrequires energy. Either reactants or products must be added, removed, or changed. If a cell were a closed system, its chemical\nreactions would reach equilibrium, and it would die because there would be insufficient free energy left to perform the\nnecessary work to maintain life. In a living cell, chemical reactions are constantly moving towards equilibrium, but never reach\nit. This is because a living cell is an open system. Materials pass in and out, the cell recycles the products of certain chemical\nreactions into other reactions, and there is never chemical equilibrium. In this way, living organisms are in a constant energy-\nrequiring, uphill battle against equilibrium and entropy. This constant energy supply ultimately comes from sunlight, which\nproduces nutrients in the photosynthesis process.\n162\nChapter 6 \u2022 Metabolism\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 6.9 Exergonic and endergonic reactions result in changes in Gibbs free energy. Exergonic reactions release energy. Endergonic\nreactions require energy to proceed.\nActivation Energy\nThere is another important concept that we must consider regarding endergonic and exergonic reactions. Even exergonic\nreactions require a small amount of energy input before they can proceed with their energy-releasing steps. These reactions\nhave a net release of energy, but still require some initial energy. Scientists call this small amount of energy input necessary for\nall chemical reactions to occur the activation energy (or free energy of activation) abbreviated as EA (Figure 6.10).\nWhy would an energy-releasing, negative \u2206G reaction actually require some energy to proceed? The reason lies in the steps that\ntake place during a chemical reaction. During chemical reactions, certain chemical bonds break and new ones form. For\nexample, when a glucose molecule breaks down, bonds between the molecule's carbon atoms break. Since these are energy-\nstoring bonds, they release energy when broken. However, to get them into a state that allows the bonds to break, the molecule\nmust be somewhat contorted. A small energy input is required to achieve this contorted state. This contorted state is the\ntransition state, and it is a high-energy, unstable state. For this reason, reactant molecules do not last long in their transition\nstate, but very quickly proceed to the chemical reaction's next steps. Free energy diagrams illustrate the energy profiles for a\ngiven reaction. Whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic determines whether the products in the diagram will exist at a\nlower or higher energy state than both the reactants and the products. However, regardless of this measure, the transition state\nof the reaction exists at a higher energy state than the reactants, and thus, EA is always positive.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch an animation of the move from free energy to transition state at this (http://openstax.org/l/energy_reaction) site.\nFrom where does the activation energy that chemical reactants require come? The activation energy's required source to push\nreactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings. Heat energy (the total bond energy of reactants or products in\na chemical reaction) speeds up the molecule's motion, increasing the frequency and force with which they collide. It also moves\natoms and bonds within the molecule slightly, helping them reach their transition state. For this reason, heating a system will\ncause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently. Increasing the pressure on a system has the same effect.\nOnce reactants have absorbed enough heat energy from their surroundings to reach the transition state, the reaction will\nproceed.\nThe activation energy of a particular reaction determines the rate at which it will proceed. The higher the activation energy, the\nslower the chemical reaction. The example of iron rusting illustrates an inherently slow reaction. This reaction occurs slowly over\ntime because of its high EA. Additionally, burning many fuels, which is strongly exergonic, will take place at a negligible rate\nunless sufficient heat from a spark overcomes their activation energy. However, once they begin to burn, the chemical reactions\nrelease enough heat to continue the burning process, supplying the activation energy for surrounding fuel molecules. Like these\nreactions outside of cells, the activation energy for most cellular reactions is too high for heat energy to overcome at efficient\nrates. In other words, in order for important cellular reactions to occur at appreciable rates (number of reactions per unit time),\ntheir activation energies must be lowered (Figure 6.10). Scientist refer to this as catalysis. This is a very good thing as far as living\ncells are concerned. Important macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA, store considerable energy, and their\nbreakdown is exergonic. If cellular temperatures alone provided enough heat energy for these exergonic reactions to overcome\n6.2 \u2022 Potential, Kinetic, Free, and Activation Energy\n163\ntheir activation barriers, the cell's essential components would disintegrate.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 6.10 Activation energy is the energy required for a reaction to proceed, and it is lower if the reaction is catalyzed. This diagram's\nhorizontal axis describes the sequence of events in time.\nIf no activation energy were required to break down sucrose (table sugar), would you be able to store it in a sugar bowl?\n6.3 The Laws of Thermodynamics\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the concept of entropy\n\u2022\nExplain the first and second laws of thermodynamics\nThermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. The matter and its environment\nrelevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside that system is the\nsurroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water.\nEnergy transfers within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. An\nopen system is one in which energy can transfer between the system and its surroundings. The stovetop system is open because\nit can lose heat into the air. A closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings.\nBiological organisms are open systems. Energy exchanges between them and their surroundings, as they consume energy-\nstoring molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to\nthe laws of physics. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe.\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics\nThe first law of thermodynamics deals with the total amount of energy in the universe. It states that this total amount of energy\nis constant. In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy in the universe.\nEnergy exists in many different forms. According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may transfer from place to place or\ntransform into different forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The transfers and transformations of energy take place\naround us all the time. Light bulbs transform electrical energy into light energy. Gas stoves transform chemical energy from\nnatural gas into heat energy. Plants perform one of the most biologically useful energy transformations on earth: that of\nconverting sunlight energy into the chemical energy stored within organic molecules (Figure 6.2). Figure 6.11 examples of energy\ntransformations.\nThe challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or transform\ninto usable energy to do work. Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge very well. Chemical energy stored within organic\nmolecules such as sugars and fats transforms through a series of cellular chemical reactions into energy within ATP molecules.\nEnergy in ATP molecules is easily accessible to do work. Examples of the types of work that cells need to do include building\n164\nChapter 6 \u2022 Metabolism\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncomplex molecules, transporting materials, powering the beating motion of cilia or flagella, contracting muscle fibers to create\nmovement, and reproduction.\nFigure 6.11 Here are two examples of energy transferring from one system to another and transformed from one form to another. Humans\ncan convert the chemical energy in food, like this ice cream cone, into kinetic energy (the energy of movement to ride a bicycle). Plants can\nconvert electromagnetic radiation (light energy) from the sun into chemical energy. (credit \u201cice cream\u201d: modification of work by D. Sharon\nPruitt; credit \u201ckids on bikes\u201d: modification of work by Michelle Riggen-Ransom; credit \u201cleaf\u201d: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics\nA living cell\u2019s primary tasks of obtaining, transforming, and using energy to do work may seem simple. However, the second law\nof thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. None of the energy transfers that we have discussed,\nalong with all energy transfers and transformations in the universe, is completely efficient. In every energy transfer, some\namount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy. Thermodynamically, scientists define\nheat energy as energy that transfers from one system to another that is not doing work. For example, when an airplane flies\nthrough the air, it loses some of its energy as heat energy due to friction with the surrounding air. This friction actually heats the\nair by temporarily increasing air molecule speed. Likewise, some energy is lost as heat energy during cellular metabolic\nreactions. This is good for warm-blooded creatures like us, because heat energy helps to maintain our body temperature. Strictly\nspeaking, no energy transfer is completely efficient, because some energy is lost in an unusable form.\nAn important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder (or randomness). The more energy that a system loses to\nits surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system. Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or disorder\nwithin a system as entropy. High entropy means high disorder and low energy (Figure 6.12). To better understand entropy, think\nof a student\u2019s bedroom. If no energy or work were put into it, the room would quickly become messy. It would exist in a very\ndisordered state, one of high entropy. Energy must be put into the system, in the form of the student doing work and putting\neverything away, in order to bring the room back to a state of cleanliness and order. This state is one of low entropy. Similarly, a\ncar or house must be constantly maintained with work in order to keep it in an ordered state. Left alone, a house's or car's\nentropy gradually increases through rust and degradation. Molecules and chemical reactions have varying amounts of entropy\nas well. For example, as chemical reactions reach a state of equilibrium, entropy increases, and as molecules at a high\nconcentration in one place diffuse and spread out, entropy also increases.\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION\nTransfer of Energy and the Resulting Entropy\nSet up a simple experiment to understand how energy transfers and how a change in entropy results.\n1.\nTake a block of ice. This is water in solid form, so it has a high structural order. This means that the molecules cannot move\nvery much and are in a fixed position. The ice's temperature is 0\u00b0C. As a result, the system's entropy is low.\n2.\nAllow the ice to melt at room temperature. What is the state of molecules in the liquid water now? How did the energy\ntransfer take place? Is the system's entropy higher or lower? Why?\n3.\nHeat the water to its boiling point. What happens to the system's entropy when the water is heated?\nThink of all physical systems of in this way: Living things are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to maintain\nthemselves in a state of low entropy. As living systems take in energy-storing molecules and transform them through chemical\nreactions, they lose some amount of usable energy in the process, because no reaction is completely efficient. They also produce\nwaste and by-products that are not useful energy sources. This process increases the entropy of the system\u2019s surroundings. Since\n6.3 \u2022 The Laws of Thermodynamics\n165\nall energy transfers result in losing some usable energy, the second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer or\ntransformation increases the universe's entropy. Even though living things are highly ordered and maintain a state of low\nentropy, the universe's entropy in total is constantly increasing due to losing usable energy with each energy transfer that\noccurs. Essentially, living things are in a continuous uphill battle against this constant increase in universal entropy.\nFigure 6.12 Entropy is a measure of randomness or disorder in a system. Gases have higher entropy than liquids, and liquids have higher\nentropy than solids.\n6.4 ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain ATP's role as the cellular energy currency\n\u2022\nDescribe how energy releases through ATP hydrolysis\nEven exergonic, energy-releasing reactions require a small amount of activation energy in order to proceed. However, consider\nendergonic reactions, which require much more energy input, because their products have more free energy than their\nreactants. Within the cell, from where does energy to power such reactions come? The answer lies with an energy-supplying\nmolecule scientists call adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. This is a small, relatively simple molecule (Figure 6.13), but within\nsome of its bonds, it contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work. Think of\nthis molecule as the cells' primary energy currency in much the same way that money is the currency that people exchange for\nthings they need. ATP powers the majority of energy-requiring cellular reactions.\nFigure 6.13 ATP is the cell's primary energy currency. It has an adenosine backbone with three phosphate groups attached.\nAs its name suggests, adenosine triphosphate is comprised of adenosine bound to three phosphate groups (Figure 6.13).\nAdenosine is a nucleoside consisting of the nitrogenous base adenine and a five-carbon sugar, ribose. The three phosphate\ngroups, in order of closest to furthest from the ribose sugar, are alpha, beta, and gamma. Together, these chemical groups\nconstitute an energy powerhouse. However, not all bonds within this molecule exist in a particularly high-energy state. Both\n166\nChapter 6 \u2022 Metabolism\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nbonds that link the phosphates are equally high-energy bonds (phosphoanhydride bonds) that, when broken, release sufficient\nenergy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes. These high-energy bonds are the bonds between the second and\nthird (or beta and gamma) phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups. These bonds are \u201chigh-\nenergy\u201d because the products of such bond breaking\u2014adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and one inorganic phosphate group\n(Pi)\u2014have considerably lower free energy than the reactants: ATP and a water molecule. Because this reaction takes place using a\nwater molecule, it is a hydrolysis reaction. In other words, ATP hydrolyzes into ADP in the following reaction:\nLike most chemical reactions, ATP to ADP hydrolysis is reversible. The reverse reaction regenerates ATP from ADP + Pi. Cells rely\non ATP regeneration just as people rely on regenerating spent money through some sort of income. Since ATP hydrolysis\nreleases energy, ATP regeneration must require an input of free energy. This equation expresses ATP formation:\nTwo prominent questions remain with regard to using ATP as an energy source. Exactly how much free energy releases with ATP\nhydrolysis, and how does that free energy do cellular work? The calculated \u2206G for the hydrolysis of one ATP mole into ADP and Pi\nis \u22127.3 kcal/mole (\u221230.5 kJ/mol). Since this calculation is true under standard conditions, one would expect a different value\nexists under cellular conditions. In fact, the \u2206G for one ATP mole's hydrolysis in a living cell is almost double the value at\nstandard conditions: \u201314 kcal/mol (\u221257 kJ/mol).\nATP is a highly unstable molecule. Unless quickly used to perform work, ATP spontaneously dissociates into ADP + Pi, and the\nfree energy released during this process is lost as heat. The second question we posed above discusses how ATP hydrolysis\nenergy release performs work inside the cell. This depends on a strategy scientists call energy coupling. Cells couple the ATP\nhydrolysis' exergonic reaction allowing them to proceed. One example of energy coupling using ATP involves a transmembrane\nion pump that is extremely important for cellular function. This sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+ pump) drives sodium out of\nthe cell and potassium into the cell (Figure 6.14). A large percentage of a cell\u2019s ATP powers this pump, because cellular processes\nbring considerable sodium into the cell and potassium out of it. The pump works constantly to stabilize cellular concentrations\nof sodium and potassium. In order for the pump to turn one cycle (exporting three Na+ ions and importing two K+ ions), one\nATP molecule must hydrolyze. When ATP hydrolyzes, its gamma phosphate does not simply float away, but it actually transfers\nonto the pump protein. Scientists call this process of a phosphate group binding to a molecule phosphorylation. As with most\nATP hydrolysis cases, a phosphate from ATP transfers onto another molecule. In a phosphorylated state, the Na+/K+ pump has\nmore free energy and is triggered to undergo a conformational change. This change allows it to release Na+ to the cell's outside.\nIt then binds extracellular K+, which, through another conformational change, causes the phosphate to detach from the pump.\nThis phosphate release triggers the K+ to release to the cell's inside. Essentially, the energy released from the ATP hydrolysis\ncouples with the energy required to power the pump and transport Na+ and K+ ions. ATP performs cellular work using this basic\nform of energy coupling through phosphorylation.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 6.14 The sodium-potassium pump is an example of energy coupling. The energy derived from exergonic ATP hydrolysis pumps\n6.4 \u2022 ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate\n167\nsodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane.\nOne ATP molecule's hydrolysis releases 7.3 kcal/mol of energy (\u2206G = \u22127.3 kcal/mol of energy). If it takes 2.1 kcal/mol of energy to\nmove one Na+ across the membrane (\u2206G = +2.1 kcal/mol of energy), how many sodium ions could one ATP molecule's hydrolysis\nmove?\nOften during cellular metabolic reactions, such as nutrient synthesis and breakdown, certain molecules must alter slightly in\ntheir conformation to become substrates for the next step in the reaction series. One example is during the very first steps of\ncellular respiration, when a sugar glucose molecule breaks down in the process of glycolysis. In the first step, ATP is required to\nphosphorylze glucose, creating a high-energy but unstable intermediate. This phosphorylation reaction powers a\nconformational change that allows the phosphorylated glucose molecule to convert to the phosphorylated sugar fructose.\nFructose is a necessary intermediate for glycolysis to move forward. Here, ATP hydrolysis' exergonic reaction couples with the\nendergonic reaction of converting glucose into a phosphorylated intermediate in the pathway. Once again, the energy released\nby breaking a phosphate bond within ATP was used for phosphorylyzing another molecule, creating an unstable intermediate\nand powering an important conformational change.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSee an animation of the ATP-producing glycolysis process at this site (http://openstax.org/l/glycolysis_stgs) .\n6.5 Enzymes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the role of enzymes in metabolic pathways\n\u2022\nExplain how enzymes function as molecular catalysts\n\u2022\nDiscuss enzyme regulation by various factors\nA substance that helps a chemical reaction to occur is a catalyst, and the special molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions\nare enzymes. Almost all enzymes are proteins, comprised of amino acid chains, and they perform the critical task of lowering\nthe activation energies of chemical reactions inside the cell. Enzymes do this by binding to the reactant molecules, and holding\nthem in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes take place more readily. It is important\nto remember that enzymes do not change the reaction's \u2206G. In other words, they do not change whether a reaction is exergonic\n(spontaneous) or endergonic. This is because they do not change the reactants' or products' free energy. They only reduce the\nactivation energy required to reach the transition state (Figure 6.15).\nFigure 6.15 Enzymes lower the reaction's activation energy but do not change the reaction's free energy.\nEnzyme Active Site and Substrate Specificity\nThe chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzyme\u2019s substrates. There may be one or more substrates, depending\n168\nChapter 6 \u2022 Metabolism\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\non the particular chemical reaction. In some reactions, a single-reactant substrate breaks down into multiple products. In\nothers, two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule. Two reactants might also enter a reaction, both become\nmodified, and leave the reaction as two products. The location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is the enzyme\u2019s\nactive site. This is where the \u201caction\u201d happens. Since enzymes are proteins, there is a unique combination of amino acid residues\n(also side chains, or R groups) within the active site. Different properties characterize each residue. These can be large or small,\nweakly acidic or basic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, positively or negatively charged, or neutral. The unique combination of\namino acid residues, their positions, sequences, structures, and properties, creates a very specific chemical environment within\nthe active site. This specific environment is suited to bind, albeit briefly, to a specific chemical substrate (or substrates). Due to\nthis jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates (which adapts to find the best fit between the transition\nstate and the active site), enzymes are known for their specificity. The \u201cbest fit\u201d results from the shape and the amino acid\nfunctional group\u2019s attraction to the substrate. There is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate and, thus, for each\nchemical reaction; however, there is flexibility as well.\nThe fact that active sites are so perfectly suited to provide specific environmental conditions also means that they are subject to\nlocal enviromental influences. It is true that increasing the environmental temperature generally increases reaction rates,\nenzyme-catalyzed or otherwise. However, increasing or decreasing the temperature outside of an optimal range can affect\nchemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are less well suited to bind substrates. High temperatures will\neventually cause enzymes, like other biological molecules, to denature, a process that changes the substance's natural\nproperties. Likewise, the local environment's pH can also affect enzyme function. Active site amino acid residues have their own\nacidic or basic properties that are optimal for catalysis. These residues are sensitive to changes in pH that can impair the way\nsubstrate molecules bind. Enzymes are suited to function best within a certain pH range, and, as with temperature, extreme\nenvironmental pH values (acidic or basic) can cause enzymes to denature.\nInduced Fit and Enzyme Function\nFor many years, scientists thought that enzyme-substrate binding took place in a simple \u201clock-and-key\u201d fashion. This model\nasserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step. However, current research supports a\nmore refined view scientists call induced fit (Figure 6.16). This model expands upon the lock-and-key model by describing a\nmore dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate. As the enzyme and substrate come together, their interaction causes\na mild shift in the enzyme\u2019s structure that confirms an ideal binding arrangement between the enzyme and the substrate's\ntransition state. This ideal binding maximizes the enzyme\u2019s ability to catalyze its reaction.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView an induced fit animation at this website (http://openstax.org/l/hexokinase) .\nWhen an enzyme binds its substrate, it forms an enzyme-substrate complex. This complex lowers the reaction's activation\nenergy and promotes its rapid progression in one of many ways. On a basic level, enzymes promote chemical reactions that\ninvolve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an optimal orientation. The appropriate region (atoms\nand bonds) of one molecule is juxtaposed to the other molecule's appropriate region with which it must react. Another way in\nwhich enzymes promote substrate reaction is by creating an optimal environment within the active site for the reaction to occur.\nCertain chemical reactions might proceed best in a slightly acidic or non-polar environment. The chemical properties that\nemerge from the particular arrangement of amino acid residues within an active site create the perfect environment for an\nenzyme\u2019s specific substrates to react.\nYou have learned that the activation energy required for many reactions includes the energy involved in manipulating or slightly\ncontorting chemical bonds so that they can easily break and allow others to reform. Enzymatic action can aid this process. The\nenzyme-substrate complex can lower the activation energy by contorting substrate molecules in such a way as to facilitate bond-\nbreaking, helping to reach the transition state. Finally, enzymes can also lower activation energies by taking part in the chemical\nreaction itself. The amino acid residues can provide certain ions or chemical groups that actually form covalent bonds with\nsubstrate molecules as a necessary step of the reaction process. In these cases, it is important to remember that the enzyme will\nalways return to its original state at the reaction's completion. One of enzymes' hallmark properties is that they remain\nultimately unchanged by the reactions they catalyze. After an enzyme catalyzes a reaction, it releases its product(s).\n6.5 \u2022 Enzymes\n169\nFigure 6.16 According to the induced-fit model, both enzyme and substrate undergo dynamic conformational changes upon binding. The\nenzyme contorts the substrate into its transition state, thereby increasing the reaction's rate.\nMetabolism Control Through Enzyme Regulation\nIt would seem ideal to have a scenario in which all the encoded enzymes in an organism\u2019s genome existed in abundant supply\nand functioned optimally under all cellular conditions, in all cells, at all times. In reality, this is far from the case. A variety of\nmechanisms ensure that this does not happen. Cellular needs and conditions vary from cell to cell, and change within individual\ncells over time. The required enzymes and energetic demands of stomach cells are different from those of fat storage cells, skin\ncells, blood cells, and nerve cells. Furthermore, a digestive cell works much harder to process and break down nutrients during\nthe time that closely follows a meal compared with many hours after a meal. As these cellular demands and conditions vary, so\ndo the amounts and functionality of different enzymes.\nSince the rates of biochemical reactions are controlled by activation energy, and enzymes lower and determine activation\nenergies for chemical reactions, the relative amounts and functioning of the variety of enzymes within a cell ultimately\ndetermine which reactions will proceed and at which rates. This determination is tightly controlled. In certain cellular\nenvironments, environmental factors like pH and temperature partly control enzyme activity. There are other mechanisms\nthrough which cells control enzyme activity and determine the rates at which various biochemical reactions will occur.\nMolecular Regulation of Enzymes\nEnzymes can be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce their activity. There are many different kinds of molecules that\ninhibit or promote enzyme function, and various mechanisms exist for doing so. For example, in some cases of enzyme\ninhibition, an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the substrate\nfrom binding. When this happens, the enzyme is inhibited through competitive inhibition, because an inhibitor molecule\ncompetes with the substrate for active site binding (Figure 6.17). Alternatively, in noncompetitive inhibition, an inhibitor\nmolecule binds to the enzyme at an allosteric site, a binding site away from the active site, and still manages to block substrate\nbinding to the active site.\nFigure 6.17 Competitive and noncompetitive inhibition affect the reaction's rate differently. Competitive inhibitors affect the initial rate but\ndo not affect the maximal rate; whereas, noncompetitive inhibitors affect the maximal rate.\n170\nChapter 6 \u2022 Metabolism\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nSome inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces the\nenzyme's affinity for its substrate. This type of inhibition is an allosteric inhibition (Figure 6.18). More than one polypeptide\ncomprise most allosterically regulated enzymes, meaning that they have more than one protein subunit. When an allosteric\ninhibitor binds to an enzyme, all active sites on the protein subunits change slightly such that they bind their substrates with\nless efficiency. There are allosteric activators as well as inhibitors. Allosteric activators bind to locations on an enzyme away from\nthe active site, inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme\u2019s active site(s) for its substrate(s).\nFigure 6.18 Allosteric inhibitors modify the enzyme's active site so that substrate binding is reduced or prevented. In contrast, allosteric\nactivators modify the enzyme's active site so that the affinity for the substrate increases.\nEveryday Connection\nDrug Discovery by Looking for Inhibitors of Key Enzymes in Specific Pathways\nFigure 6.19 Have you ever wondered how pharmaceutical drugs are developed? (credit: Deborah Austin)\nEnzymes are key components of metabolic pathways. Understanding how enzymes work and how they can be regulated is a\nkey principle behind developing many pharmaceutical drugs (Figure 6.19) on the market today. Biologists working in this\nfield collaborate with other scientists, usually chemists, to design drugs.\nConsider statins for example\u2014which is a class of drugs that reduces cholesterol levels. These compounds are essentially\ninhibitors of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. HMG-CoA reductase is the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol from lipids\nin the body. By inhibiting this enzyme, the drug reduces cholesterol levels synthesized in the body. Similarly,\nacetaminophen, popularly marketed under the brand name Tylenol, is an inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase. While it\n6.5 \u2022 Enzymes\n171\nMany enzymes don\u2019t work optimally, or even at all, unless bound to other specific non-protein helper molecules, either\ntemporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds. Two types of helper molecules\nare cofactors and coenzymes. Binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their respective\nenzymes. Cofactors are inorganic ions such as iron (Fe++) and magnesium (Mg++). One example of an enzyme that requires a\nmetal ion as a cofactor is the enzyme that builds DNA molecules, DNA polymerase, which requires a bound zinc ion (Zn++) to\nfunction. Coenzymes are organic helper molecules, with a basic atomic structure comprised of carbon and hydrogen, which are\nrequired for enzyme action. The most common sources of coenzymes are dietary vitamins (Figure 6.20). Some vitamins are\nprecursors to coenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes. Vitamin C is a coenzyme for multiple enzymes that take part in\nbuilding the important connective tissue component, collagen. An important step in breaking down glucose to yield energy is\ncatalysis by a multi-enzyme complex scientists call pyruvate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is a complex of several\nenzymes that actually requires one cofactor (a magnesium ion) and five different organic coenzymes to catalyze its specific\nchemical reaction. Therefore, enzyme function is, in part, regulated by an abundance of various cofactors and coenzymes, which\nthe diets of most organisms supply.\nFigure 6.20 Vitamins are important coenzymes or precursors of coenzymes, and are required for enzymes to function properly. Multivitamin\nis effective in providing relief from fever and inflammation (pain), scientists still do not completely understand its\nmechanism of action.\nHow are drugs developed? One of the first challenges in drug development is identifying the specific molecule that the drug\nis intended to target. In the case of statins, HMG-CoA reductase is the drug target. Researchers identify targets through\npainstaking research in the laboratory. Identifying the target alone is not sufficient. Scientists also need to know how the\ntarget acts inside the cell and which reactions go awry in the case of disease. Once researchers identify the target and the\npathway, then the actual drug design process begins. During this stage, chemists and biologists work together to design and\nsynthesize molecules that can either block or activate a particular reaction. However, this is only the beginning: both if and\nwhen a drug prototype is successful in performing its function, then it must undergo many tests from in vitro experiments\nto clinical trials before it can obtain FDA approval to be on the market.\n172\nChapter 6 \u2022 Metabolism\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncapsules usually contain mixtures of all the vitamins at different percentages.\nEnzyme Compartmentalization\nIn eukaryotic cells, molecules such as enzymes are usually compartmentalized into different organelles. This allows for yet\nanother level of regulation of enzyme activity. Enzymes required only for certain cellular processes are sometimes housed\nseparately along with their substrates, allowing for more efficient chemical reactions. Examples of this sort of enzyme\nregulation based on location and proximity include the enzymes involved in the latter stages of cellular respiration, which take\nplace exclusively in the mitochondria, and the enzymes involved in digesting cellular debris and foreign materials, located\nwithin lysosomes.\nFeedback Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways\nMolecules can regulate enzyme function in many ways. However, a major question remains: What are these molecules and from\nwhere do they come? Some are cofactors and coenzymes, ions, and organic molecules, as you have learned. What other\nmolecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation, such as allosteric modulation, and competitive and noncompetitive\ninhibition? The answer is that a wide variety of molecules can perform these roles. Some include pharmaceutical and non-\npharmaceutical drugs, toxins, and poisons from the environment. Perhaps the most relevant sources of enzyme regulatory\nmolecules, with respect to cellular metabolism, are cellular metabolic reaction products themselves. In a most efficient and\nelegant way, cells have evolved to use their own reactions' products for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity. Feedback\ninhibition involves using a reaction product to regulate its own further production (Figure 6.21). The cell responds to the\nabundance of specific products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic reactions. Such reaction products may\ninhibit the enzymes that catalyzed their production through the mechanisms that we described above.\nFigure 6.21 Metabolic pathways are a series of reactions that multiple enzymes catalyze. Feedback inhibition, where the pathway's end\nproduct inhibits an upstream step, is an important regulatory mechanism in cells.\nProducing both amino acids and nucleotides is controlled through feedback inhibition. Additionally, ATP is an allosteric\nregulator of some of the enzymes involved in sugar's catabolic breakdown, the process that produces ATP. In this way, when ATP\nis abundant, the cell can prevent its further production. Remember that ATP is an unstable molecule that can spontaneously\ndissociate into ADP. If too much ATP were present in a cell, much of it would go to waste. Alternatively, ADP serves as a positive\nallosteric regulator (an allosteric activator) for some of the same enzymes that ATP inhibits. Thus, when relative ADP levels are\nhigh compared to ATP, the cell is triggered to produce more ATP through sugar catabolism.\n6.5 \u2022 Enzymes\n173\n", "key_terms": "\nactivation energy\nenergy necessary for reactions to occur\nactive site\nenzyme's specific region to which the substrate\nbinds\nallosteric inhibition\ninhibition by a binding event at a site\ndifferent from the active site, which induces a\nconformational change and reduces the enzyme's affinity\nfor its substrate\nanabolic\n(also, anabolism) pathways that require an energy\ninput to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones\nATP\nadenosine triphosphate, the cell\u2019s energy currency\nbioenergetics\nstudy of energy flowing through living\nsystems\ncatabolic\n(also, catabolism) pathways in which complex\nmolecules break down into simpler ones\nchemical energy\npotential energy in chemical bonds that\nreleases when those bonds are broken\ncoenzyme\nsmall organic molecule, such as a vitamin or its\nderivative, which is required to enhance an enzyme's\nactivity\ncofactor\ninorganic ion, such as iron and magnesium ions,\nrequired for optimal enzyme activity regulation\ncompetitive inhibition\ntype of inhibition in which the\ninhibitor competes with the substrate molecule by\nbinding to the enzyme's active site\ndenature\nprocess that changes a subtance's natural\nproperties\nendergonic\ndescribes chemical reactions that require\nenergy input\nenthalpy\na system's total energy\nentropy (S)\nmeasure of randomness or disorder within a\nsystem\nexergonic\ndescribes chemical reactions that release free\nenergy\nfeedback inhibition\na product's effect of a reaction\nsequence to decrease its further production by inhibiting\nthe first enzyme's activity in the pathway that produces it\nfree energy\nGibbs free energy is the usable energy, or\nenergy that is available to do work\nheat\nenergy transferred from one system to another that is\nnot work (energy of the molecules' motion or particles)\nheat energy\ntotal bond energy of reactants or products in a\nchemical reaction\ninduced fit\ndynamic fit between the enzyme and its\nsubstrate, in which both components modify their\nstructures to allow for ideal binding\nkinetic energy\nenergy type that takes place with objects or\nparticles in motion\nmetabolism\nall the chemical reactions that take place\ninside cells, including anabolism and catabolism\nphosphoanhydride bond\nbond that connects phosphates in\nan ATP molecule\npotential energy\nenergy type that has the potential to do\nwork; stored energy\nsubstrate\nmolecule on which the enzyme acts\nthermodynamics\nstudy of energy and energy transfer\ninvolving physical matter\ntransition state\nhigh-energy, unstable state (an\nintermediate form between the substrate and the\nproduct) occurring during a chemical reaction\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n6.1 Energy and Metabolism\nCells perform the functions of life through various chemical\nreactions. A cell\u2019s metabolism refers to the chemical\nreactions that take place within it. There are metabolic\nreactions that involve breaking down complex chemicals into\nsimpler ones, such as breaking down large macromolecules.\nScientists refer to this process as catabolism, and we\nassociate such reactions an energy release. On the other end\nof the spectrum, anabolism refers to metabolic processes\nthat build complex molecules out of simpler ones, such as\nmacromolecule synthesis. Anabolic processes require energy.\nGlucose synthesis and glucose breakdown are examples of\nanabolic and catabolic pathways, respectively.\n6.2 Potential, Kinetic, Free, and\nActivation Energy\nEnergy comes in many different forms. Objects in motion do\nphysical work, and kinetic energy is the energy of objects in\nmotion. Objects that are not in motion may have the\npotential to do work, and thus, have potential energy.\nMolecules also have potential energy because breaking\nmolecular bonds has the potential to release energy. Living\ncells depend on harvesting potential energy from molecular\nbonds to perform work. Free energy is a measure of energy\nthat is available to do work. A system's free energy changes\nduring energy transfers such as chemical reactions, and\nscientists refer to this change as \u2206G.\nA reaction's \u2206G can be negative or positive, meaning that the\nreaction releases energy or consumes energy, respectively. A\nreaction with a negative \u2206G that gives off energy is an\nexergonic reaction. One with a positive \u2206G that requires\nenergy input is an endergonic reaction. Exergonic reactions\nare spontaneous because their products have less energy\nthan their reactants. Endergonic reactions' products have a\nhigher energy state than the reactants, and so these are\nnonspontaneous reactions. However, all reactions (including\nspontaneous -\u2206G reactions) require an initial energy input\n174\nChapter 6 \u2022 Key Terms\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nin order to reach the transition state, at which they will\nproceed. This initial input of energy is the activation energy.\n6.3 The Laws of Thermodynamics\nIn studying energy, scientists use the term \u201csystem\u201d to refer\nto the matter and its environment involved in energy\ntransfers. Everything outside of the system is the\nsurroundings. Single cells are biological systems. We can\nthink of systems as having a certain amount of order. It takes\nenergy to make a system more ordered. The more ordered a\nsystem, the lower its entropy. Entropy is a measure of a\nsystem's disorder. As a system becomes more disordered, the\nlower its energy and the higher its entropy.\nThe laws of thermodynamics are a series of laws that\ndescribe the properties and processes of energy transfer. The\nfirst law states that the total amount of energy in the\nuniverse is constant. This means that energy cannot be\ncreated or destroyed, only transferred or transformed. The\nsecond law of thermodynamics states that every energy\ntransfer involves some loss of energy in an unusable form,\nsuch as heat energy, resulting in a more disordered system.\nIn other words, no energy transfer is completely efficient,\nand all transfers trend toward disorder.\n6.4 ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate\nATP is the primary energy-supplying molecule for living\ncells. ATP is comprised of a nucleotide, a five-carbon sugar,\nand three phosphate groups. The bonds that connect the\nphosphates (phosphoanhydride bonds) have high-energy\ncontent. The energy released from ATP hydrolysis into ADP +\nPi performs cellular work. Cells use ATP to perform work by\ncoupling ATP hydrolysis' exergonic reaction with endergonic\nreactions. ATP donates its phosphate group to another\nmolecule via phosphorylation. The phosphorylated molecule\nis at a higher-energy state and is less stable than its\nunphosphorylated form, and this added energy from\nphosphate allows the molecule to undergo its endergonic\nreaction.\n6.5 Enzymes\nEnzymes are chemical catalysts that accelerate chemical\nreactions at physiological temperatures by lowering their\nactivation energy. Enzymes are usually proteins consisting of\none or more polypeptide chains. Enzymes have an active site\nthat provides a unique chemical environment, comprised of\ncertain amino acid R groups (residues). This unique\nenvironment is perfectly suited to convert particular\nchemical reactants for that enzyme, scientists call\nsubstrates, into unstable intermediates that they call\ntransition states. Enzymes and substrates bind with an\ninduced fit, which means that enzymes undergo slight\nconformational adjustments upon substrate contact, leading\nto full, optimal binding. Enzymes bind to substrates and\ncatalyze reactions in four different ways: bringing substrates\ntogether in an optimal orientation, compromising the bond\nstructures of substrates so that bonds can break down more\neasily, providing optimal environmental conditions for a\nreaction to occur, or participating directly in their chemical\nreaction by forming transient covalent bonds with the\nsubstrates.\nEnzyme action must be regulated so that in a given cell at a\ngiven time, the desired reactions catalyze and the undesired\nreactions are not. Enzymes are regulated by cellular\nconditions, such as temperature and pH. They are also\nregulated through their location within a cell, sometimes\ncompartmentalized so that they can only catalyze reactions\nunder certain circumstances. Enzyme inhibition and\nactivation via other molecules are other important ways that\nenzymes are regulated. Inhibitors can act competitively,\nnoncompetitively, or allosterically. Noncompetitive\ninhibitors are usually allosteric. Activators can also enhance\nenzyme function allosterically. The most common method by\nwhich cells regulate the enzymes in metabolic pathways is\nthrough feedback inhibition. During feedback inhibition,\nmetabolic pathway products serve as inhibitors (usually\nallosteric) of one or more of the enzymes (usually the first\ncommitted enzyme of the pathway) involved in the pathway\nthat produces them.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

This type of generating plant starts with underground thermal energy\n(heat) and transforms it into electrical energy that will be transported to homes and factories. Like a\ngenerating plant, plants and animals also must take in energy from the environment and convert it into\na form that their cells can use. Mass and its stored energy enter an organism\u2019s body in one form and are\nconverted into another form that can fuel the organism\u2019s life functions. In the process of photosynthesis,\nplants and other photosynthetic producers take in energy in the form of light (solar energy) and convert\nit into chemical energy in the form of glucose, which stores this energy in its chemical bonds. Then, a\nseries of metabolic pathways, collectively called cellular respiration, extracts the energy from the bonds\nin glucose and converts it into a form that all living things can use.\nChapter Outline\n7.1 Energy in Living\nSystems\n7.2 Glycolysis\n7.3 Oxidation of\nPyruvate and the\nCitric Acid Cycle\n7.4 Oxidative\nPhosphorylation\n7.5 Metabolism without\nOxygen\n7.6 Connections of\nCarbohydrate,\nProtein, and Lipid\nMetabolic Pathways\n7.7 Regulation of\nCellular Respiration\n7.1 Energy in Living Systems\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the importance of electrons in the transfer of energy in living systems\n\u2022\nExplain how ATP is used by cells as an energy source\nEnergy production within a cell involves many coordinated chemical pathways. Most of these pathways are\ncombinations of oxidation and reduction reactions, which occur at the same time. An oxidation reaction\nstrips an electron from an atom in a compound, and the addition of this electron to another compound is a\nreduction reaction. Because oxidation and reduction usually occur together, these pairs of reactions are\ncalled oxidation reduction reactions, or redox reactions.\nElectrons and Energy\nThe removal of an electron from a molecule (oxidizing it), results in a decrease in potential energy in the\noxidized compound. The electron (sometimes as part of a hydrogen atom) does not remain unbonded,\nhowever, in the cytoplasm of a cell. Rather, the electron is shifted to a second compound, reducing the\nsecond compound. The shift of an electron from one compound to another removes some potential energy\nfrom the first compound (the oxidized compound) and increases the potential energy of the second\ncompound (the reduced compound). The transfer of electrons between molecules is important because most\nof the energy stored in atoms and used to fuel cell functions is in the form of high-energy electrons. The\ntransfer of energy in the form of high-energy electrons allows the cell to transfer and use energy in an\nincremental fashion\u2014in small packages rather than in a single, destructive burst. This chapter focuses on\nthe extraction of energy from food; you will see that as you track the path of the transfers, you are tracking\nthe path of electrons moving through metabolic pathways.\nElectron Carriers\nIn living systems, a small class of compounds functions as electron shuttles: they bind and carry high-energy\nelectrons between compounds in biochemical pathways. The principal electron carriers we will consider are\nderived from the B vitamin group and are derivatives of nucleotides. These compounds can be easily reduced\n(that is, they accept electrons) or oxidized (they lose electrons). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)\n(Figure 7.2) is derived from vitamin B3, niacin. NAD+ is the oxidized form of the molecule; NADH is the\nreduced form of the molecule after it has accepted two electrons and a proton (which together are the\nequivalent of a hydrogen atom with an extra electron). Note that if a compound has an \u201cH\u201d on it, it is\ngenerally reduced (e.g., NADH is the reduced form of NAD).\nNAD+ can accept electrons from an organic molecule according to the general equation:\nWhen electrons are added to a compound, it is reduced. A compound that reduces another is called a\nreducing agent. In the above equation, RH is a reducing agent, and NAD+ is reduced to NADH. When\nelectrons are removed from a compound, it is oxidized. A compound that oxidizes another is called an\noxidizing agent. In the above equation, NAD+ is an oxidizing agent, and RH is oxidized to R.\nSimilarly, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD+) is derived from vitamin B2, also called riboflavin. Its reduced\nform is FADH2. A second variation of NAD, NADP, contains an extra phosphate group. Both NAD+ and FAD+\nare extensively used in energy extraction from sugars, and NADP plays an important role in anabolic\nreactions and photosynthesis in plants.\n180\nChapter 7 \u2022 Cellular Respiration\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 7.2 The oxidized form of the electron carrier (NAD+) is shown on the left, and the reduced form (NADH) is shown on the right. The\nnitrogenous base in NADH has one more hydrogen ion and two more electrons than in NAD+.\nATP in Living Systems\nA living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy. Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell,\nwhich would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell. Rather, a cell must be able to\nhandle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells\naccomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is often called the \u201cenergy currency\u201d of the cell, and,\nlike currency, this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. How? It functions similarly to a\nrechargeable battery.\nWhen ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released. The energy is used to do\nwork by the cell, usually when the released phosphate binds to another molecule, thereby activating it. For example, in the\nmechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies the energy to move the contractile muscle proteins. Recall the active\ntransport work of the sodium-potassium pump in cell membranes. ATP alters the structure of the integral protein that\nfunctions as the pump, changing its affinity for sodium and potassium. In this way, the cell performs work, pumping ions\nagainst their electrochemical gradients.\nATP Structure and Function\nAt the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded to a\nribose molecule and to a single phosphate group (Figure 7.3). Ribose is a five-carbon sugar found in RNA, and AMP is one of the\nnucleotides in RNA. The addition of a second phosphate group to this core molecule results in the formation of adenosine\ndiphosphate (ADP); the addition of a third phosphate group forms adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n7.1 \u2022 Energy in Living Systems\n181\nFigure 7.3 ATP (adenosine triphosphate) has three phosphate groups that can be removed by hydrolysis (addition of H2O) to form ADP\n(adenosine diphosphate) or AMP (adenosine monophosphate). The negative charges on the phosphate group naturally repel each other,\nrequiring energy to bond them together and releasing energy when these bonds are broken.\nThe addition of a phosphate group to a molecule requires energy. Phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel one\nanother when they are arranged in series, as they are in ADP and ATP. This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules\ninherently unstable. The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP, a process called dephosphorylation, releases energy.\nEnergy from ATP\nHydrolysis is the process of breaking complex macromolecules apart. During hydrolysis, water is split, or lysed, and the\nresulting hydrogen atom (H+) and a hydroxyl group (OH-), or hydroxide, are added to the larger molecule. The hydrolysis of ATP\nproduces ADP, together with an inorganic phosphate ion (Pi), and the release of free energy. To carry out life processes, ATP is\ncontinuously broken down into ADP, and like a rechargeable battery, ADP is continuously regenerated into ATP by the\nreattachment of a third phosphate group. Water, which was broken down into its hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group\n(hydroxide) during ATP hydrolysis, is regenerated when a third phosphate is added to the ADP molecule, reforming ATP.\nObviously, energy must be infused into the system to regenerate ATP. Where does this energy come from? In nearly every living\nthing on Earth, the energy comes from the metabolism of glucose, fructose, or galactose, all isomers with the chemical formula\nC6H12O6 but different molecular configurations. In this way, ATP is a direct link between the limited set of exergonic pathways of\nglucose catabolism and the multitude of endergonic pathways that power living cells.\nPhosphorylation\nRecall that, in some chemical reactions, enzymes may bind to several substrates that react with each other on the enzyme,\nforming an intermediate complex. An intermediate complex is a temporary structure, and it allows one of the substrates (such\nas ATP) and reactants to more readily react with each other; in reactions involving ATP, ATP is one of the substrates and ADP is a\nproduct. During an endergonic chemical reaction, ATP forms an intermediate complex with the substrate and enzyme in the\nreaction. This intermediate complex allows the ATP to transfer its third phosphate group, with its energy, to the substrate, a\nprocess called phosphorylation. Phosphorylation refers to the addition of the phosphate (~P). This is illustrated by the following\ngeneric reaction, in which A and B represent two different substrates:\nWhen the intermediate complex breaks apart, the energy is used to modify the substrate and convert it into a product of the\nreaction. The ADP molecule and a free phosphate ion are released into the medium and are available for recycling through cell\nmetabolism.\nSubstrate Phosphorylation\nATP is generated through two mechanisms during the breakdown of glucose. A few ATP molecules are generated (that is,\nregenerated from ADP) as a direct result of the chemical reactions that occur in the catabolic pathways. A phosphate group is\nremoved from an intermediate reactant in the pathway, and the free energy of the reaction is used to add the third phosphate to\nan available ADP molecule, producing ATP (Figure 7.4). This very direct method of phosphorylation is called substrate-level\nphosphorylation.\n182\nChapter 7 \u2022 Cellular Respiration\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 7.4 In phosphorylation reactions, the gamma (third) phosphate of ATP is attached to a protein.\nOxidative Phosphorylation\nMost of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism, however, is derived from a much more complex process, chemiosmosis,\nwhich takes place in mitochondria (Figure 7.5) within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a prokaryotic cell.\nChemiosmosis, a process of ATP production in cellular metabolism, is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during\nglucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight. The\nproduction of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen\nin the process.\nFigure 7.5 In eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation takes place in mitochondria. In prokaryotes, this process takes place in the plasma\nmembrane. (Credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nCAREER CONNECTION\nMitochondrial Disease Physician\nWhat happens when the critical reactions of cellular respiration do not proceed correctly? This may happen in mitochondrial\ndiseases, which are genetic disorders of metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders can arise from mutations in nuclear or\nmitochondrial DNA, and they result in the production of less energy than is normal in body cells. In type 2 diabetes, for\ninstance, the oxidation efficiency of NADH is reduced, impacting oxidative phosphorylation but not the other steps of\nrespiration. Symptoms of mitochondrial diseases can include muscle weakness, lack of coordination, stroke-like episodes, and\nloss of vision and hearing. Most affected people are diagnosed in childhood, although there are some adult-onset diseases.\nIdentifying and treating mitochondrial disorders is a specialized medical field. The educational preparation for this profession\nrequires a college education, followed by medical school with a specialization in medical genetics. Medical geneticists can be\nboard certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and go on to become associated with professional organizations\ndevoted to the study of mitochondrial diseases, such as the Mitochondrial Medicine Society and the Society for Inherited\nMetabolic Disorders.\n7.1 \u2022 Energy in Living Systems\n183\n7.2 Glycolysis\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the overall result in terms of molecules produced during the chemical breakdown of glucose by\nglycolysis\n\u2022\nCompare the output of glycolysis in terms of ATP molecules and NADH molecules produced\nAs you have read, nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar glucose. Glycolysis is the\nfirst step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism. In fact, nearly all living organisms carry out\nglycolysis as part of their metabolism. The process does not use oxygen directly and therefore is termed anaerobic. Glycolysis\ntakes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Glucose enters heterotrophic cells in two ways. One\nmethod is through secondary active transport in which the transport takes place against the glucose concentration gradient. The\nother mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called GLUT proteins, also known as glucose transporter proteins. These\ntransporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose.\nGlycolysis begins with the six-carbon ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three-\ncarbon sugar called pyruvate. Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases. The first part of the glycolysis pathway traps the glucose\nmolecule in the cell and uses energy to modify it so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly into the two three-\ncarbon molecules. The second part of glycolysis extracts energy from the molecules and stores it in the form of ATP and\nNADH\u2014remember: this is the reduced form of NAD.\nFirst Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Requiring Steps)\nStep 1. The first step in glycolysis (Figure 7.6) is catalyzed by hexokinase, an enzyme with broad specificity that catalyzes the\nphosphorylation of six-carbon sugars. Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose using ATP as the source of the phosphate, producing\nglucose-6-phosphate, a more reactive form of glucose. This reaction prevents the phosphorylated glucose molecule from\ncontinuing to interact with the GLUT proteins, and it can no longer leave the cell because the negatively charged phosphate will\nnot allow it to cross the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane.\nStep 2. In the second step of glycolysis, an isomerase converts glucose-6-phosphate into one of its isomers,\nfructose-6-phosphate (this isomer has a phosphate attached at the location of the sixth carbon of the ring). An isomerase is an\nenzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers. (This change from phosphoglucose to\nphosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three-carbon molecules.)\nStep 3. The third step is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase. A second\nATP molecule donates a high-energy phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. In this pathway,\nphosphofructokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme. It is active when the concentration of ADP is high; it is less active when ADP\nlevels are low and the concentration of ATP is high. Thus, if there is \u201csufficient\u201d ATP in the system, the pathway slows down. This\nis a type of end product inhibition, since ATP is the end product of glucose catabolism.\nStep 4. The newly added high-energy phosphates further destabilize fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The fourth step in glycolysis\nemploys an enzyme, aldolase, to cleave fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two three-carbon isomers: dihydroxyacetone phosphate\nand glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.\nStep 5. In the fifth step, an isomerase transforms the dihydroxyacetone-phosphate into its isomer, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.\nThus, the pathway will continue with two molecules of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. At this point in the pathway, there is a net\ninvestment of energy from two ATP molecules in the breakdown of one glucose molecule.\n184\nChapter 7 \u2022 Cellular Respiration\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 7.6 The first half of glycolysis uses two ATP molecules in the phosphorylation of glucose, which is then split into two three-carbon\nmolecules.\nSecond Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Releasing Steps)\nSo far, glycolysis has cost the cell two ATP molecules and produced two small, three-carbon sugar molecules. Both of these\nmolecules will proceed through the second half of the pathway, and sufficient energy will be extracted to pay back the two ATP\nmolecules used as an initial investment and produce a profit for the cell of two additional ATP molecules and two even higher-\nenergy NADH molecules.\nStep 6. The sixth step in glycolysis (Figure 7.7) oxidizes the sugar (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), extracting high-energy\nelectrons, which are picked up by the electron carrier NAD+, producing NADH. The sugar is then phosphorylated by the addition\nof a second phosphate group, producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Note that the second phosphate group does not require\nanother ATP molecule.\nFigure 7.7 The second half of glycolysis involves phosphorylation without ATP investment (step 6) and produces two NADH and four ATP\nmolecules per glucose.\nHere again is a potential limiting factor for this pathway. The continuation of the reaction depends upon the availability of the\noxidized form of the electron carrier, NAD+. Thus, NADH must be continuously oxidized back into NAD+ in order to keep this\nstep going. If NAD+ is not available, the second half of glycolysis slows down or stops. If oxygen is available in the system, the\nNADH will be oxidized readily, though indirectly, and the high-energy electrons from the hydrogen released in this process will\nbe used to produce ATP. In an environment without oxygen, an alternate pathway (fermentation) can provide the oxidation of\nNADH to NAD+.\nStep 7. In the seventh step, catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase (an enzyme named for the reverse reaction),\n1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a high-energy phosphate to ADP, forming one molecule of ATP. (This is an example of\nsubstrate-level phosphorylation.) A carbonyl group on the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is oxidized to a carboxyl group, and\n3-phosphoglycerate is formed.\nStep 8. In the eighth step, the remaining phosphate group in 3-phosphoglycerate moves from the third carbon to the second\n7.2 \u2022 Glycolysis\n185\ncarbon, producing 2-phosphoglycerate (an isomer of 3-phosphoglycerate). The enzyme catalyzing this step is a mutase\n(isomerase).\nStep 9. Enolase catalyzes the ninth step. This enzyme causes 2-phosphoglycerate to lose water from its structure; this is a\ndehydration reaction, resulting in the formation of a double bond that increases the potential energy in the remaining\nphosphate bond and produces phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).\nStep 10. The last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase (the enzyme in this case is named for the reverse\nreaction of pyruvate\u2019s conversion into PEP) and results in the production of a second ATP molecule by substrate-level\nphosphorylation and the compound pyruvic acid (or its salt form, pyruvate). Many enzymes in enzymatic pathways are named\nfor the reverse reactions, since the enzyme can catalyze both forward and reverse reactions (these may have been described\ninitially by the reverse reaction that takes place in vitro, under nonphysiological conditions).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGain a better understanding of the breakdown of glucose by glycolysis by visiting this site (http://openstax.org/l/glycolysis) to\nsee the process in action.\nOutcomes of Glycolysis\nGlycolysis begins with glucose and produces two pyruvate molecules, four new ATP molecules, and two molecules of NADH.\n(Note: two ATP molecules are used in the first half of the pathway to prepare the six-carbon ring for cleavage, so the cell has a net\ngain of two ATP molecules and two NADH molecules for its use). If the cell cannot catabolize the pyruvate molecules further, it\nwill harvest only two ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose. Mature mammalian red blood cells do not have mitochondria\nand thus are not capable of aerobic respiration\u2014the process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen\u2014and\nglycolysis is their sole source of ATP. If glycolysis is interrupted, these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodium-potassium\npumps, and eventually, they die.\nThe last step in glycolysis will not occur if pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of pyruvate, is not available\nin sufficient quantities. In this situation, the entire glycolysis pathway will proceed, but only two ATP molecules will be made in\nthe second half. Thus, pyruvate kinase is a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis.\n7.3 Oxidation of Pyruvate and the Citric Acid Cycle\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how a circular pathway, such as the citric acid cycle, fundamentally differs from a linear biochemical\npathway, such as glycolysis\n\u2022\nDescribe how pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, is prepared for entry into the citric acid cycle\nIf oxygen is available, aerobic respiration will go forward. In eukaryotic cells, the pyruvate molecules produced at the end of\nglycolysis are transported into the mitochondria, which are the sites of cellular respiration. There, pyruvate is transformed into\nan acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme A (CoA). The resulting compound is\ncalled acetyl CoA. CoA is derived from vitamin B5, pantothenic acid. Acetyl CoA can be used in a variety of ways by the cell, but\nits major function is to deliver the acetyl group derived from pyruvate to the next stage of the pathway in glucose catabolism.\nBreakdown of Pyruvate\nIn order for pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, to enter the next pathway, it must undergo several changes. The conversion is a\nthree-step process (Figure 7.8).\nStep 1. A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvate, releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide into the surrounding medium. This\nreaction creates a two-carbon hydroxyethyl group bound to the enzyme (pyruvate dehydrogenase). We should note that this is\nthe first of the six carbons from the original glucose molecule to be removed. (This step proceeds twice because there are two\npyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolsis for every molecule of glucose metabolized anaerobically; thus, two of the six\ncarbons will have been removed at the end of both steps.)\nStep 2. The hydroxyethyl group is oxidized to an acetyl group, and the electrons are picked up by NAD+, forming NADH. The\nhigh-energy electrons from NADH will be used later to generate ATP.\n186\nChapter 7 \u2022 Cellular Respiration\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nStep 3. The enzyme-bound acetyl group is transferred to CoA, producing a molecule of acetyl CoA.\nFigure 7.8 Upon entering the mitochondrial matrix, a multienzyme complex converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA. In the process, carbon\ndioxide is released, and one molecule of NADH is formed.\nNote that during the second stage of glucose metabolism, whenever a carbon atom is removed, it is bound to two oxygen atoms,\nproducing carbon dioxide, one of the major end products of cellular respiration.\nAcetyl CoA to CO2\nIn the presence of oxygen, acetyl CoA delivers its acetyl (2C) group to a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form citrate, a six-\ncarbon molecule with three carboxyl groups; this pathway will harvest the remainder of the extractable energy from what began\nas a glucose molecule and release the remaining four CO2 molecules. This single pathway is called by different names: the citric\nacid cycle (for the first intermediate formed\u2014citric acid, or citrate\u2014when acetate joins to the oxaloacetate), the TCA cycle\n(because citric acid or citrate and isocitrate are tricarboxylic acids), and the Krebs cycle, after Hans Krebs, who first identified\nthe steps in the pathway in the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles.\nCitric Acid Cycle\nLike the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the citric acid cycle takes place in the matrix of mitochondria. Almost all of the\nenzymes of the citric acid cycle are soluble, with the single exception of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which is\nembedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is a closed loop: the last part of\nthe pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step. The eight steps of the cycle are a series of redox, dehydration,\nhydration, and decarboxylation reactions that produce two carbon dioxide molecules, one GTP/ATP, and the reduced carriers\nNADH and FADH2 (Figure 7.9). This is considered an aerobic pathway because the NADH and FADH2 produced must transfer\ntheir electrons to the next pathway in the system, which will use oxygen. If this transfer does not occur, the oxidation steps of\nthe citric acid cycle also do not occur. Note that the citric acid cycle produces very little ATP directly and does not directly\nconsume oxygen.\n7.3 \u2022 Oxidation of Pyruvate and the Citric Acid Cycle\n187\nFigure 7.9 In the citric acid cycle, the acetyl group from acetyl CoA is attached to a four-carbon oxaloacetate molecule to form a six-carbon\ncitrate molecule. Through a series of steps, citrate is oxidized, releasing two carbon dioxide molecules for each acetyl group fed into the\ncycle. In the process, three NAD+ molecules are reduced to NADH, one FAD molecule is reduced to FADH2, and one ATP or GTP (depending\non the cell type) is produced (by substrate-level phosphorylation). Because the final product of the citric acid cycle is also the first reactant,\nthe cycle runs continuously in the presence of sufficient reactants. (credit: modification of work by \u201cYikrazuul\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nSteps in the Citric Acid Cycle\nStep 1. Prior to the first step, a transitional phase occurs during which pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl CoA. Then, the first\nstep of the cycle begins: This condensation step combines the two-carbon acetyl group with a four-carbon oxaloacetate molecule\nto form a six-carbon molecule of citrate. CoA is bound to a sulfhydryl group (-SH) and diffuses away to eventually combine with\nanother acetyl group. This step is irreversible because it is highly exergonic. The rate of this reaction is controlled by negative\nfeedback and the amount of ATP available. If ATP levels increase, the rate of this reaction decreases. If ATP is in short supply, the\nrate increases.\nStep 2. In step two, citrate loses one water molecule and gains another as citrate is converted into its isomer, isocitrate.\nStep 3. In step three, isocitrate is oxidized, producing a five-carbon molecule, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, along with a molecule of CO2\nand two electrons, which reduce NAD+ to NADH. This step is also regulated by negative feedback from ATP and NADH and a\npositive effect of ADP.\nStep 4. Steps three and four are both oxidation and decarboxylation steps, which as we have seen, release electrons that reduce\n188\nChapter 7 \u2022 Cellular Respiration\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nNAD+to NADH and release carboxyl groups that form CO2 molecules. Alpha-ketoglutarate is the product of step three, and a\nsuccinyl group is the product of step four. CoA binds with the succinyl group to form succinyl CoA. The enzyme that catalyzes\nstep four is regulated by feedback inhibition of ATP, succinyl CoA, and NADH.\nStep 5. In step five, a phosphate group is substituted for coenzyme A, and a high-energy bond is formed. This energy is used in\nsubstrate-level phosphorylation (during the conversion of the succinyl group to succinate) to form either guanine triphosphate\n(GTP) or ATP. There are two forms of the enzyme, called isoenzymes, for this step, depending upon the type of animal tissue in\nwhich they are found. One form is found in tissues that use large amounts of ATP, such as heart and skeletal muscle. This form\nproduces ATP. The second form of the enzyme is found in tissues that have a high number of anabolic pathways, such as liver.\nThis form produces GTP. GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP; however, its use is more restricted. In particular, protein\nsynthesis primarily uses GTP.\nStep 6. Step six is a dehydration process that converts succinate into fumarate. Two hydrogen atoms are transferred to FAD,\nreducing it to FADH2. (Note: the energy contained in the electrons of these hydrogens is insufficient to reduce NAD+ but\nadequate to reduce FAD.) Unlike NADH, this carrier remains attached to the enzyme and transfers the electrons to the electron\ntransport chain directly. This process is made possible by the localization of the enzyme catalyzing this step inside the inner\nmembrane of the mitochondrion.\nStep 7. Water is added by hydrolysis to fumarate during step seven, and malate is produced. The last step in the citric acid cycle\nregenerates oxaloacetate by oxidizing malate. Another molecule of NADH is then produced in the process.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView an animation of the citric acid cycle here (http://openstax.org/l/krebs_cycle) .\nProducts of the Citric Acid Cycle\nTwo carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group, representing four out of the six carbons of one glucose\nmolecule. Two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle; however, these do not necessarily contain the\nmost recently added carbon atoms. The two acetyl carbon atoms will eventually be released on later turns of the cycle; thus, all\nsix carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are eventually incorporated into carbon dioxide. Each turn of the cycle\nforms three NADH molecules and one FADH2 molecule. These carriers will connect with the last portion of aerobic respiration,\nthe electron transport chain, to produce ATP molecules. One GTP or ATP is also made in each cycle. Several of the intermediate\ncompounds in the citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing nonessential amino acids; therefore, the cycle is amphibolic (both\ncatabolic and anabolic).\n7.4 Oxidative Phosphorylation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe how electrons move through the electron transport chain and explain what happens to their energy\nlevels during this process\n\u2022\nExplain how a proton (H+) gradient is established and maintained by the electron transport chain\nYou have just read about two pathways in glucose catabolism\u2014glycolysis and the citric acid cycle\u2014that generate ATP. Most of\nthe ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose, however, is not generated directly from these pathways. Instead, it\nis derived from a process that begins by moving electrons through a series of electron carriers that undergo redox reactions. This\nprocess causes hydrogen ions to accumulate within the intermembranous space. Therefore, a concentration gradient forms in\nwhich hydrogen ions diffuse out of the intermembranous space into the mitochondrial matrix by passing through ATP synthase.\nThe current of hydrogen ions powers the catalytic action of ATP synthase, which phosphorylates ADP, producing ATP.\nElectron Transport Chain\nThe electron transport chain (Figure 7.10) is the last component of aerobic respiration and is the only part of glucose metabolism\nthat uses atmospheric oxygen. Oxygen continuously diffuses into plant tissues (typically through stomata), as well as into fungi\nand bacteria; however, in animals, oxygen enters the body through a variety of respiratory systems. Electron transport is a series\nof redox reactions that resembles a relay race or bucket brigade in that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the\nnext, to the endpoint of the chain where the electrons reduce molecular oxygen and, along with associated protons, produces\nwater. There are four complexes composed of proteins, labeled I through IV in Figure 7.10, and the aggregation of these four\n7.4 \u2022 Oxidative Phosphorylation\n189\ncomplexes, together with associated mobile, accessory electron carriers, is called the electron transport chain. The electron\ntransport chain is present with multiple copies in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes and within the plasma\nmembrane of prokaryotes.\nFigure 7.10 The electron transport chain is a series of electron transporters embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane that shuttles\nelectrons from NADH and FADH2 to molecular oxygen. In the process, protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the\nintermembrane space, and oxygen is reduced to form water.\nComplex I\nFirst, two electrons are carried to the first complex via NADH. This complex, labeled I, is composed of flavin mononucleotide\n(FMN) and an iron-sulfur (Fe-S)-containing protein. FMN, which is derived from vitamin B2 (also called riboflavin), is one of\nseveral prosthetic groups or cofactors in the electron transport chain. A prosthetic group is a nonprotein molecule required for\nthe activity of a protein. Prosthetic groups are organic or inorganic, nonpeptide molecules bound to a protein that facilitate its\nfunction. Prosthetic groups include coenzymes, which are the prosthetic groups of enzymes. The enzyme in complex I is NADH\ndehydrogenase and is a very large protein, containing 45 amino acid chains. Complex I can pump four hydrogen ions across the\nmembrane from the matrix into the intermembrane space, and it is in this way that the hydrogen ion gradient is established and\nmaintained between the two compartments separated by the inner mitochondrial membrane.\nQ and Complex II\nComplex II directly receives FADH2\u2014which does not pass through complex I. The compound connecting the first and second\ncomplexes to the third is ubiquinone B. The Q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through the hydrophobic core of the\nmembrane. Once it is reduced (QH2), ubiquinone delivers its electrons to the next complex in the electron transport chain. Q\nreceives the electrons derived from NADH from complex I, and the electrons derived from FADH2 from complex II. This enzyme\nand FADH2 form a small complex that delivers electrons directly to the electron transport chain, bypassing the first complex.\nSince these electrons bypass and thus do not energize the proton pump in the first complex, fewer ATP molecules are made from\nthe FADH2 electrons. The number of ATP molecules ultimately obtained is directly proportional to the number of protons\npumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane.\nComplex III\nThe third complex is composed of cytochrome b\u2014another Fe-S protein, a Rieske center (2Fe-2S center), and cytochrome c\nproteins. This complex is also called cytochrome oxidoreductase. Cytochrome proteins have a prosthetic group of heme. The\nheme molecule is similar to the heme in hemoglobin, but it carries electrons, not oxygen. As a result, the iron ion at its core is\nreduced and oxidized as it passes the electrons, fluctuating between different oxidation states: Fe++ (reduced) and Fe+++\n(oxidized). The heme molecules in the cytochromes have slightly different characteristics due to the effects of the different\nproteins binding to them, giving slightly different characteristics to each complex. Complex III pumps protons through the\nmembrane and passes its electrons to cytochrome c for transport to the fourth complex of proteins and enzymes. (Cytochrome c\nreceives electrons from Q; however, whereas Q carries pairs of electrons, cytochrome c can accept only one at a time.)\n190\nChapter 7 \u2022 Cellular Respiration\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nComplex IV\nThe fourth complex is composed of cytochrome proteins c, a, and a3. This complex contains two heme groups (one in each of the\ntwo cytochromes, a, and a3) and three copper ions (a pair of CuA and one CuB in cytochrome a3). The cytochromes hold an oxygen\nmolecule very tightly between the iron and copper ions until the oxygen is completely reduced by the gain of two electrons. The\nreduced oxygen then picks up two hydrogen ions from the surrounding medium to make water (H2O). The removal of the\nhydrogen ions from the system contributes to the ion gradient that forms the foundation for the process of chemiosmosis.\nChemiosmosis\nIn chemiosmosis, the free energy from the series of redox reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen ions (protons)\nacross the mitochondrial membrane. The uneven distribution of H+ ions across the membrane establishes both concentration\nand electrical gradients (thus, an electrochemical gradient), owing to the hydrogen ions\u2019 positive charge and their aggregation\non one side of the membrane.\nIf the membrane were continuously open to simple diffusion by the hydrogen ions, the ions would tend to diffuse back across\ninto the matrix, driven by the concentrations producing their electrochemical gradient. Recall that many ions cannot diffuse\nthrough the nonpolar regions of phospholipid membranes without the aid of ion channels. Similarly, hydrogen ions in the\nmatrix space can only pass through the inner mitochondrial membrane by an integral membrane protein called ATP synthase\n(Figure 7.11). This complex protein acts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing through it, down\ntheir electrochemical gradient. The turning of parts of this molecular machine facilitates the addition of a phosphate to ADP,\nforming ATP, using the potential energy of the hydrogen ion gradient.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 7.11 ATP synthase is a complex, molecular machine that uses a proton (H+) gradient to form ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate\n(Pi).

Why do you think this might be an effective weight-loss drug?\n7.4 \u2022 Oxidative Phosphorylation\n191\nChemiosmosis (Figure 7.12) is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during aerobic glucose catabolism; it is also the\nmethod used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight in the process of photophosphorylation.\nRecall that the production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis in mitochondria is called oxidative phosphorylation. The\noverall result of these reactions is the production of ATP from the energy of the electrons removed from hydrogen atoms. These\natoms were originally part of a glucose molecule. At the end of the pathway, the electrons are used to reduce an oxygen molecule\nto oxygen ions. The extra electrons on the oxygen attract hydrogen ions (protons) from the surrounding medium, and water is\nformed. Thus, oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 7.12 In oxidative phosphorylation, the pH gradient formed by the electron transport chain is used by ATP synthase to form ATP.\nCyanide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, a component of the electron transport chain. If cyanide poisoning occurs, would you\nexpect the pH of the intermembrane space to increase or decrease? What effect would cyanide have on ATP synthesis?\nATP Yield\nThe number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies. For example, the number of hydrogen ions that\nthe electron transport chain complexes can pump through the membrane varies between species. Another source of variance\nstems from the shuttle of electrons across the membranes of the mitochondria. (The NADH generated from glycolysis cannot\neasily enter mitochondria.) Thus, electrons are picked up on the inside of mitochondria by either NAD+ or FAD+. As you have\nlearned earlier, these FAD+ molecules can transport fewer ions; consequently, fewer ATP molecules are generated when FAD+\nacts as a carrier. NAD+ is used as the electron transporter in the liver and FAD+ acts in the brain.\nAnother factor that affects the yield of ATP molecules generated from glucose is the fact that intermediate compounds in these\npathways are also used for other purposes. Glucose catabolism connects with the pathways that build or break down all other\nbiochemical compounds in cells, and the result is somewhat messier than the ideal situations described thus far. For example,\nsugars other than glucose are fed into the glycolytic pathway for energy extraction. In addition, the five-carbon sugars that form\nnucleic acids are made from intermediates in glycolysis. Certain nonessential amino acids can be made from intermediates of\nboth glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, are also made from intermediates in these\npathways, and both amino acids and triglycerides are broken down for energy through these pathways. Overall, in living\nsystems, these pathways of glucose catabolism extract about 34 percent of the energy contained in glucose, with the remainder\nbeing released as heat.\n192\nChapter 7 \u2022 Cellular Respiration\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n7.5 Metabolism without Oxygen\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the fundamental difference between anaerobic cellular respiration and fermentation\n\u2022\nDescribe the type of fermentation that readily occurs in animal cells and the conditions that initiate that\nfermentation\nIn aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is an oxygen molecule, O2. If aerobic respiration occurs, then ATP will be\nproduced using the energy of high-energy electrons carried by NADH or FADH2to the electron transport chain. If aerobic\nrespiration does not occur, NADH must be reoxidized to NAD+ for reuse as an electron carrier for the glycolytic pathway to\ncontinue. How is this done? Some living systems use an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor. Processes that use an\norganic molecule to regenerate NAD+ from NADH are collectively referred to as fermentation. In contrast, some living systems\nuse an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor. Both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration, in which\norganisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen.\nAnaerobic Cellular Respiration\nCertain prokaryotes, including some species in the domains Bacteria and Archaea, use anaerobic respiration. For example, a\ngroup of archaeans called methanogens reduces carbon dioxide to methane to oxidize NADH. These microorganisms are found\nin soil and in the digestive tracts of ruminants, such as cows and sheep. Similarly, sulfate-reducing bacteria, most of which are\nanaerobic (Figure 7.13), reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide to regenerate NAD+ from NADH.\nFigure 7.13 The green color seen in these coastal waters is from an eruption of hydrogen sulfide\u2013producing bacteria. These anaerobic,\nsulfate-reducing bacteria release hydrogen sulfide gas as they decompose algae in the water.

In muscles, lactic acid accumulation must be removed by the blood circulation, and when the lactic acid loses a\nhydrogen, the resulting lactate is brought to the liver for further metabolism. The chemical reactions of lactic acid fermentation\n7.5 \u2022 Metabolism without Oxygen\n193\nare the following:\nThe enzyme used in this reaction is lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The reaction can proceed in either direction, but the reaction\nfrom left to right is inhibited by acidic conditions. Such lactic acid accumulation was once believed to cause muscle stiffness,\nfatigue, and soreness, although more recent research disputes this hypothesis. Once the lactic acid has been removed from the\nmuscle and circulated to the liver, it can be reconverted into pyruvic acid and further catabolized for energy.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 7.14 Lactic acid fermentation is common in muscle cells that have run out of oxygen.\nTremetol, a metabolic poison found in the white snakeroot plant, prevents the metabolism of lactate. When cows eat this plant,\ntremetol is concentrated in the milk they produce. Humans who consume the milk can become seriously ill. Symptoms of this\ndisease, which include vomiting, abdominal pain, and tremors, become worse after exercise. Why do you think this is the case?\nAlcohol Fermentation\nAnother familiar fermentation process is alcohol fermentation (Figure 7.15), which produces ethanol. The first chemical reaction\nof alcohol fermentation is the following (CO2 does not participate in the second reaction):\nThe first reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase, a cytoplasmic enzyme, with a coenzyme of thiamine pyrophosphate\n(TPP, derived from vitamin B1 and also called thiamine). A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvic acid, releasing carbon\ndioxide as a gas. The loss of carbon dioxide reduces the size of the molecule by one carbon, producing acetaldehyde. The second\nreaction is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase to oxidize NADH to NAD+ and reduce acetaldehyde to ethanol. The fermentation\nof pyruvic acid by yeast produces the ethanol found in alcoholic beverages. Ethanol tolerance of yeast is variable, ranging from\nabout 5 percent to 21 percent, depending on the yeast strain and environmental conditions.\n194\nChapter 7 \u2022 Cellular Respiration\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 7.15 Fermentation of grape juice into wine produces CO2 as a byproduct. Fermentation tanks have valves so that the pressure inside\nthe tanks created by the carbon dioxide produced can be released.\nOther Types of Fermentation\nOther fermentation methods take place in bacteria. We should note that many prokaryotes are facultatively anaerobic. This\nmeans that they can switch between aerobic respiration and fermentation, depending on the availability of free oxygen. Certain\nprokaryotes, such as Clostridia, are obligate anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen.\nOxygen is a poison to these microorganisms and kills them on exposure. We should also note that all forms of fermentation,\nexcept lactic acid fermentation, produce gas. The production of particular types of gas is used as an indicator of the\nfermentation of specific carbohydrates, which plays a role in the laboratory identification of the bacteria. Various methods of\nfermentation are used by assorted organisms to ensure an adequate supply of NAD+ for the sixth step in glycolysis. Without\nthese pathways, this step would not occur, and ATP could not be harvested from the breakdown of glucose.\n7.6 Connections of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Lipid Metabolic\nPathways\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the ways in which carbohydrate metabolic pathways, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle interrelate\nwith protein and lipid metabolic pathways\n\u2022\nExplain why metabolic pathways are not considered closed systems\nYou have learned about the catabolism of glucose, which provides energy to living cells. But living things consume organic\ncompounds other than glucose for food. How does a turkey sandwich end up as ATP in your cells? This happens because all of the\ncatabolic pathways for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids eventually connect into glycolysis and the citric acid cycle pathways\n(see Figure 7.17). Metabolic pathways should be thought of as porous and interconnecting\u2014that is, substances enter from other\npathways, and intermediates leave for other pathways. These pathways are not closed systems! Many of the substrates,\nintermediates, and products in a particular pathway are reactants in other pathways.\nConnections of Other Sugars to Glucose Metabolism\nGlycogen, a polymer of glucose, is an energy storage molecule in animals. When there is adequate ATP present, excess glucose is\nstored as glycogen in both liver and muscle cells. The glycogen will be hydrolyzed into glucose 1-phosphate monomers (G-1-P) if\nblood sugar levels drop. The presence of glycogen as a source of glucose allows ATP to be produced for a longer period of time\nduring exercise. Glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) and converted into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in\nboth muscle and liver cells, and this product enters the glycolytic pathway.\nSucrose is a disaccharide with a molecule of glucose and a molecule of fructose bonded together with a glycosidic linkage.\nFructose is one of the three \u201cdietary\u201d monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose (part of the milk sugar dissacharide\nlactose), which are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. The catabolism of both fructose and galactose\n7.6 \u2022 Connections of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Lipid Metabolic Pathways\n195\nproduces the same number of ATP molecules as glucose.\nConnections of Proteins to Glucose Metabolism\nProteins are hydrolyzed by a variety of enzymes in cells. Most of the time, the amino acids are recycled into the synthesis of new\nproteins. If there are excess amino acids, however, or if the body is in a state of starvation, some amino acids will be shunted\ninto the pathways of glucose catabolism (Figure 7.16). It is very important to note that each amino acid must have its amino\ngroup removed prior to entry into these pathways. The amino group is converted into ammonia. In mammals, the liver\nsynthesizes urea from two ammonia molecules and a carbon dioxide molecule. Thus, urea is the principal waste product in\nmammals, produced from the nitrogen originating in amino acids, and it leaves the body in urine. It should be noted that amino\nacids can be synthesized from the intermediates and reactants in the cellular respiration cycle.\nFigure 7.16 The carbon skeletons of certain amino acids (indicated in boxes) derived from proteins can feed into the citric acid cycle.\n(credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nConnections of Lipid and Glucose Metabolisms\nThe lipids connected to the glucose pathway include cholesterol and triglycerides. Cholesterol is a lipid that contributes to cell\nmembrane flexibility and is a precursor of steroid hormones. The synthesis of cholesterol starts with acetyl groups and proceeds\nin only one direction. The process cannot be reversed.\nTriglycerides\u2014made from the bonding of glycerol and three fatty acids\u2014are a form of long-term energy storage in animals.\nAnimals can make most of the fatty acids they need. Triglycerides can be both made and broken down through parts of the\nglucose catabolism pathways. Glycerol can be phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate, which continues through glycolysis. Fatty\nacids are catabolized in a process called beta-oxidation, which takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria and converts their\nfatty acid chains into two-carbon units of acetyl groups. The acetyl groups are picked up by CoA to form acetyl CoA that proceeds\ninto the citric acid cycle.\n196\nChapter 7 \u2022 Cellular Respiration\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 7.17 Glycogen from the liver and muscles, as well as other carbohydrates, hydrolyzed into glucose-1-phosphate, together with fats\nand proteins, can feed into the catabolic pathways for carbohydrates.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nPathways of Photosynthesis and Cellular Metabolism\nThe processes of photosynthesis and cellular metabolism consist of several very complex pathways. It is generally thought that\nthe first cells arose in an aqueous environment\u2014a \u201csoup\u201d of nutrients\u2014possibly on the surface of some porous clays, perhaps in\nwarm marine environments. If these cells reproduced successfully and their numbers climbed steadily, it follows that the cells\nwould begin to deplete the nutrients from the medium in which they lived as they shifted the nutrients into the components of\ntheir own bodies. This hypothetical situation would have resulted in natural selection favoring those organisms that could exist\nby using the nutrients that remained in their environment and by manipulating these nutrients into materials upon which they\ncould survive. Selection would favor those organisms that could extract maximal value from the nutrients to which they had\naccess.\nAn early form of photosynthesis developed that harnessed the sun\u2019s energy using water as a source of hydrogen atoms, but this\npathway did not produce free oxygen (anoxygenic photosynthesis). (Another type of anoxygenic photosynthesis did not produce\nfree oxygen because it did not use water as the source of hydrogen ions; instead, it used materials such as hydrogen sulfide and\nconsequently produced sulfur). It is thought that glycolysis developed at this time and could take advantage of the simple sugars\nbeing produced but that these reactions were unable to fully extract the energy stored in the carbohydrates. The development of\nglycolysis probably predated the evolution of photosynthesis, as it was well suited to extract energy from materials\nspontaneously accumulating in the \u201cprimeval soup.\u201d A later form of photosynthesis used water as a source of electrons and\nhydrogen and generated free oxygen. Over time, the atmosphere became oxygenated, but not before the oxygen released\noxidized metals in the ocean and created a \u201crust\u201d layer in the sediment, permitting the dating of the rise of the first oxygenic\nphotosynthesizers. Living things adapted to exploit this new atmosphere that allowed aerobic respiration as we know it to\nevolve. When the full process of oxygenic photosynthesis developed and the atmosphere became oxygenated, cells were finally\nable to use the oxygen expelled by photosynthesis to extract considerably more energy from the sugar molecules using the citric\nacid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.\n7.7 Regulation of Cellular Respiration\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe how feedback inhibition would affect the production of an intermediate or product in a pathway\n\u2022\nIdentify the mechanism that controls the rate of the transport of electrons through the electron transport chain\nCellular respiration must be regulated in order to provide balanced amounts of energy in the form of ATP. The cell also must\ngenerate a number of intermediate compounds that are used in the anabolism and catabolism of macromolecules. Without\ncontrols, metabolic reactions would quickly come to a standstill as the forward and backward reactions reached a state of\nequilibrium. Resources would be used inappropriately. A cell does not need the maximum amount of ATP that it can make all\nthe time: At times, the cell needs to shunt some of the intermediates to pathways for amino acid, protein, glycogen, lipid, and\nnucleic acid production. In short, the cell needs to control its metabolism.\nRegulatory Mechanisms\nA variety of mechanisms is used to control cellular respiration. Some type of control exists at each stage of glucose metabolism.\nAccess of glucose to the cell can be regulated using the GLUT (glucose transporter) proteins that transport glucose (Figure 7.18).\n7.7 \u2022 Regulation of Cellular Respiration\n197\nDifferent forms of the GLUT protein control passage of glucose into the cells of specific tissues.\nFigure 7.18 GLUT4 is a glucose transporter that is stored in vesicles. A cascade of events that occurs upon insulin binding to a receptor in\nthe plasma membrane causes GLUT4-containing vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane so that glucose may be transported into the\ncell.\nSome reactions are controlled by having two different enzymes\u2014one each for the two directions of a reversible reaction.\nReactions that are catalyzed by only one enzyme can go to equilibrium, stalling the reaction. In contrast, if two different\nenzymes (each specific for a given direction) are necessary for a reversible reaction, the opportunity to control the rate of the\nreaction increases, and equilibrium is not reached.\nA number of enzymes involved in each of the pathways\u2014in particular, the enzyme catalyzing the first committed reaction of the\npathway\u2014are controlled by attachment of a molecule to an allosteric site on the protein. The molecules most commonly used in\nthis capacity are the nucleotides ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD+, and NADH. These regulators\u2014allosteric effectors\u2014may increase or\ndecrease enzyme activity, depending on the prevailing conditions. The allosteric effector alters the steric structure of the\nenzyme, usually affecting the configuration of the active site. This alteration of the protein\u2019s (the enzyme\u2019s) structure either\nincreases or decreases its affinity for its substrate, with the effect of increasing or decreasing the rate of the reaction. The\nattachment signals to the enzyme. This binding can increase or decrease the enzyme\u2019s activity, providing a feedback\nmechanism. This feedback type of control is effective as long as the chemical affecting it is attached to the enzyme. Once the\noverall concentration of the chemical decreases, it will diffuse away from the protein, and the control is relaxed.\nControl of Catabolic Pathways\nEnzymes, proteins, electron carriers, and pumps that play roles in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport\nchain tend to catalyze nonreversible reactions. In other words, if the initial reaction takes place, the pathway is committed to\nproceeding with the remaining reactions. Whether a particular enzyme activity is released depends upon the energy needs of\nthe cell (as reflected by the levels of ATP, ADP, and AMP).\nGlycolysis\nThe control of glycolysis begins with the first enzyme in the pathway, hexokinase (Figure 7.19). This enzyme catalyzes the\nphosphorylation of glucose, which helps to prepare the compound for cleavage in a later step. The presence of the negatively\ncharged phosphate in the molecule also prevents the sugar from leaving the cell. When hexokinase is inhibited, glucose diffuses\nout of the cell and does not become a substrate for the respiration pathways in that tissue. The product of the hexokinase\nreaction is glucose-6-phosphate, which accumulates when a later enzyme, phosphofructokinase, is inhibited.\n198\nChapter 7 \u2022 Cellular Respiration\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 7.19 The glycolysis pathway is primarily regulated at the three key enzymatic steps (1, 3, and 10) as indicated. Note that the first\ntwo steps that are regulated occur early in the pathway and involve hydrolysis of ATP.\nPhosphofructokinase is the main enzyme controlled in glycolysis. High levels of ATP or citrate or a lower, more acidic pH\ndecreases the enzyme\u2019s activity. An increase in citrate concentration can occur because of a blockage in the citric acid cycle.\nFermentation, with its production of organic acids such as lactic acid, frequently accounts for the increased acidity in a cell;\nhowever, the products of fermentation do not typically accumulate in cells.\nThe last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. The pyruvate produced can proceed to be catabolized or converted into\nthe amino acid alanine. If no more energy is needed and alanine is in adequate supply, the enzyme is inhibited. The enzyme\u2019s\nactivity is increased when fructose-1,6-bisphosphate levels increase. (Recall that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an intermediate in\nthe first half of glycolysis.) The regulation of pyruvate kinase involves phosphorylation by a kinase (pyruvate kinase), resulting in\na less-active enzyme. Dephosphorylation by a phosphatase reactivates it. Pyruvate kinase is also regulated by ATP (a negative\nallosteric effect).\nIf more energy is needed, more pyruvate will be converted into acetyl CoA through the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase. If\neither acetyl groups or NADH accumulates, there is less need for the reaction, and the rate decreases. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is\nalso regulated by phosphorylation: a kinase phosphorylates it to form an inactive enzyme, and a phosphatase reactivates it. The\nkinase and the phosphatase are also regulated.\nCitric Acid Cycle\nThe citric acid cycle is controlled through the enzymes that catalyze the reactions that make the first two molecules of NADH\n(Figure 7.9). These enzymes are isocitrate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. When adequate ATP and NADH\nlevels are available, the rates of these reactions decrease. When more ATP is needed, as reflected in rising ADP levels, the rate\nincreases. Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase will also be affected by the levels of succinyl CoA\u2014a subsequent intermediate in\nthe cycle\u2014causing a decrease in activity. A decrease in the rate of operation of the pathway at this point is not necessarily\nnegative, as the increased levels of the \u03b1-ketoglutarate not used by the citric acid cycle can be used by the cell for amino acid\n(glutamate) synthesis.\nElectron Transport Chain\nSpecific enzymes of the electron transport chain are unaffected by feedback inhibition, but the rate of electron transport\nthrough the pathway is affected by the levels of ADP and ATP. Greater ATP consumption by a cell is indicated by a buildup of\n7.7 \u2022 Regulation of Cellular Respiration\n199\nADP. As ATP usage decreases, the concentration of ADP decreases, and now, ATP begins to build up in the cell. This change in\nthe relative concentration of ADP to ATP triggers the cell to slow down the electron transport chain.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/electron_transp) to see an animation of the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis.\nFor a summary of feedback controls in cellular respiration, see Table 7.1.\nSummary of Feedback Controls in Cellular Respiration\nPathway\nEnzyme affected\nElevated levels of effector\nEffect on\npathway\nactivity\nglycolysis\nhexokinase\nglucose-6-phosphate\ndecrease\nphosphofructokinase\nlow-energy charge (ATP, AMP), fructose-6-phosphate\nvia fructose-2,6-bisphosphate\nincrease\nhigh-energy charge (ATP, AMP), citrate, acidic pH\ndecrease\npyruvate kinase\nfructose-1,6-bisphosphate\nincrease\nhigh-energy charge (ATP, AMP), alanine\ndecrease\npyruvate to acetyl\nCoA conversion\npyruvate\ndehydrogenase\nADP, pyruvate\nincrease\nacetyl CoA, ATP, NADH\ndecrease\ncitric acid cycle\nisocitrate\ndehydrogenase\nADP\nincrease\nATP, NADH\ndecrease\n\u03b1-ketoglutarate\ndehydrogenase\ncalcium ions, ADP\nincrease\nATP, NADH, succinyl CoA\ndecrease\nelectron transport\nchain\nADP\nincrease\nATP\ndecrease\nTable 7.1\n200\nChapter 7 \u2022 Cellular Respiration\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nacetyl CoA\ncombination of an acetyl group derived from\npyruvic acid and coenzyme A, which is made from\npantothenic acid (a B-group vitamin)\naerobic respiration\nprocess in which organisms convert\nenergy in the presence of oxygen\nanaerobic\nprocess that does not use oxygen\nanaerobic cellular respiration\nprocess in which organisms\nconvert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen\nATP synthase\n(also F1F0 ATP synthase) membrane-\nembedded protein complex that adds a phosphate to ADP\nwith energy from protons diffusing through it\nchemiosmosis\nprocess in which there is a production of\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) in cellular metabolism by\nthe involvement of a proton gradient across a membrane\ncitric acid cycle\n(also Krebs cycle) series of enzyme-\ncatalyzed chemical reactions of central importance in all\nliving cells for extraction of energy from carbohydrates\ndephosphorylation\nremoval of a phosphate group from a\nmolecule\nfermentation\nprocess of regenerating NAD+ with either an\ninorganic or organic compound serving as the final\nelectron acceptor; occurs in the absence of oxygen\nGLUT protein\nintegral membrane protein that transports\nglucose\nglycolysis\nprocess of breaking glucose into two three-\ncarbon molecules with the production of ATP and NADH\nisomerase\nenzyme that converts a molecule into its isomer\nKrebs cycle\n(also citric acid cycle) alternate name for the\ncitric acid cycle, named after Hans Krebs, who first\nidentified the steps in the pathway in the 1930s in pigeon\nflight muscles; see citric acid cycle\noxidative phosphorylation\nproduction of ATP using the\nprocess of chemiosmosis in the presence of oxygen\nphosphorylation\naddition of a high-energy phosphate to a\ncompound, usually a metabolic intermediate, a protein,\nor ADP\nprosthetic group\n(also prosthetic cofactor) molecule bound\nto a protein that facilitates the function of the protein\npyruvate\nthree-carbon sugar that can be decarboxylated\nand oxidized to make acetyl CoA, which enters the citric\nacid cycle under aerobic conditions; the end product of\nglycolysis\nredox reaction\nchemical reaction that consists of the\ncoupling of an oxidation reaction and a reduction\nreaction\nsubstrate-level phosphorylation\nproduction of ATP from\nADP using the excess energy from a chemical reaction\nand a phosphate group from a reactant\nTCA cycle\n(also citric acid cycle) alternate name for the\ncitric acid cycle, named after the group name for citric\nacid, tricarboxylic acid (TCA); see citric acid cycle\nubiquinone\nsoluble electron transporter in the electron\ntransport chain that connects the first or second complex\nto the third\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n7.1 Energy in Living Systems\nATP functions as the energy currency for cells. It allows the\ncell to store energy briefly and transport it within the cell to\nsupport endergonic chemical reactions. The structure of ATP\nis that of an RNA nucleotide with three phosphates attached.\nAs ATP is used for energy, a phosphate group or two are\ndetached, and either ADP or AMP is produced. Energy\nderived from glucose catabolism is used to convert ADP into\nATP. When ATP is used in a reaction, the third phosphate is\ntemporarily attached to a substrate in a process called\nphosphorylation. The two processes of ATP regeneration that\nare used in conjunction with glucose catabolism are\nsubstrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative\nphosphorylation through the process of chemiosmosis.\n7.2 Glycolysis\nGlycolysis is the first pathway within the cytoplasm used in\nthe breakdown of glucose to extract energy. It was probably\none of the earliest metabolic pathways to evolve and is used\nby nearly all of the organisms on Earth. Glycolysis consists of\ntwo parts: The first part prepares the six-carbon ring of\nglucose for cleavage into two three-carbon sugars. ATP is\ninvested in the process during this half to energize the\nseparation. The second half of glycolysis extracts ATP and\nhigh-energy electrons from hydrogen atoms and attaches\nthem to NAD+. Two ATP molecules are invested in the first\nhalf and four ATP molecules are formed by substrate\nphosphorylation during the second half. This produces a net\ngain of two ATP and two NADH molecules for the cell.\n7.3 Oxidation of Pyruvate and the\nCitric Acid Cycle\nIn the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is transformed into an\nacetyl group attached to a carrier molecule of coenzyme A.\nThe resulting acetyl CoA can enter several pathways, but\nmost often, the acetyl group is delivered to the citric acid\ncycle for further catabolism. During the conversion of\npyruvate into the acetyl group, a molecule of carbon dioxide\nand two high-energy electrons are removed. The carbon\ndioxide accounts for two (conversion of two pyruvate\nmolecules) of the six carbons of the original glucose\nmolecule. The electrons are picked up by NAD+, and the\nNADH carries the electrons to a later pathway for ATP\nChapter 7 \u2022 Key Terms\n201\nproduction. At this point, the glucose molecule that\noriginally entered cellular respiration has been completely\noxidized. Chemical potential energy stored within the\nglucose molecule has been transferred to electron carriers or\nhas been used to synthesize a few ATPs.\nThe citric acid cycle is a series of redox and decarboxylation\nreactions that removes high-energy electrons and carbon\ndioxide. The electrons, temporarily stored in molecules of\nNADH and FADH2, are used to generate ATP in a subsequent\npathway. One molecule of either GTP or ATP is produced by\nsubstrate-level phosphorylation on each turn of the cycle.\nThere is no comparison of the cyclic pathway with a linear\none.\n7.4 Oxidative Phosphorylation\nThe electron transport chain is the portion of aerobic\nrespiration that uses free oxygen as the final electron\nacceptor of the electrons removed from the intermediate\ncompounds in glucose catabolism. The electron transport\nchain is composed of four large, multiprotein complexes\nembedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and two\nsmall diffusible electron carriers shuttling electrons between\nthem. The electrons are passed through a series of redox\nreactions, with a small amount of free energy used at three\npoints to transport hydrogen ions across a membrane. This\nprocess contributes to the gradient used in chemiosmosis.\nThe electrons passing through the electron transport chain\ngradually lose energy. High-energy electrons donated to the\nchain by either NADH or FADH2 complete the chain, as low-\nenergy electrons reduce oxygen molecules and form water.\nThe level of free energy of the electrons drops from about 60\nkcal/mol in NADH or 45 kcal/mol in FADH2 to about 0 kcal/\nmol in water. The end products of the electron transport\nchain are water and ATP. A number of intermediate\ncompounds of the citric acid cycle can be diverted into the\nanabolism of other biochemical molecules, such as\nnonessential amino acids, sugars, and lipids. These same\nmolecules can serve as energy sources for the glucose\npathways.\n7.5 Metabolism without Oxygen\nIf NADH cannot be oxidized through aerobic respiration,\nanother electron acceptor is used. Most organisms will use\nsome form of fermentation to accomplish the regeneration\nof NAD+, ensuring the continuation of glycolysis. The\nregeneration of NAD+ in fermentation is not accompanied by\nATP production; therefore, the potential of NADH to produce\nATP using an electron transport chain is not utilized.\n7.6 Connections of Carbohydrate,\nProtein, and Lipid Metabolic\nPathways\nThe breakdown and synthesis of carbohydrates, proteins,\nand lipids connect with the pathways of glucose catabolism.\nThe simple sugars are galactose, fructose, glycogen, and\npentose. These are catabolized during glycolysis. The amino\nacids from proteins connect with glucose catabolism through\npyruvate, acetyl CoA, and components of the citric acid cycle.\nCholesterol synthesis starts with acetyl groups, and the\ncomponents of triglycerides come from glycerol-3-phosphate\nfrom glycolysis and acetyl groups produced in the\nmitochondria from pyruvate.\n7.7 Regulation of Cellular\nRespiration\nCellular respiration is controlled by a variety of means. The\nentry of glucose into a cell is controlled by the transport\nproteins that aid glucose passage through the cell\nmembrane. Most of the control of the respiration processes\nis accomplished through the control of specific enzymes in\nthe pathways. This is a type of negative feedback mechanism,\nturning the enzymes off. The enzymes respond most often to\nthe levels of the available nucleosides ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD+,\nand FAD. Other intermediates of the pathway also affect\ncertain enzymes in the systems.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

It is the only biological\nprocess that can capture energy that originates from sunlight and converts it into chemical compounds\n(carbohydrates) that every organism uses to power its metabolism. It is also a source of oxygen necessary for\nmany living organisms. In brief, the energy of sunlight is \u201ccaptured\u201d to energize electrons, whose energy is\nthen stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules. How long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds?\nThe energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy\ncaptured and stored by photosynthesis 350 to 200 million years ago during the Carboniferous Period.\nPlants, algae, and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing\nphotosynthesis (Figure 8.2). Because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called\nphotoautotrophs (literally, \u201cself-feeders using light\u201d). Other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most\nother bacteria, are termed heterotrophs (\u201cother feeders\u201d), because they must rely on the sugars produced by\nphotosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize\nsugars, not by using sunlight\u2019s energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds. For\nthis reason, they are referred to as chemoautotrophs.\nFigure 8.2 Photoautotrophs including (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) cyanobacteria synthesize their organic compounds\nvia photosynthesis using sunlight as an energy source. Cyanobacteria and planktonic algae can grow over enormous\nareas in water, at times completely covering the surface. In a (d) deep sea vent, chemoautotrophs, such as these (e)\nthermophilic bacteria, capture energy from inorganic compounds to produce organic compounds. The ecosystem\nsurrounding the vents has a diverse array of animals, such as tubeworms, crustaceans, and octopuses that derive\nenergy from the bacteria.

After all, a lizard sunning\nitself on a cold day can use the sun\u2019s energy to warm up in a process called behavioral thermoregulation. In\ncontrast, photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way to store the energy from solar radiation (the\n206\nChapter 8 \u2022 Photosynthesis\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\u201cphoto-\u201d part) to energy in the carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules (the \u201c-synthesis\u201d part). Those carbohydrates are\nthe energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of ATP via respiration. Therefore, photosynthesis powers 99\npercent of Earth\u2019s ecosystems. When a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer (Figure 8.3), the wolf is at the end of an\nenergy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to visible light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer,\nand finally to the wolf.\nFigure 8.3 The energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain. The predator that eats these\ndeer receives a portion of the energy that originated in the photosynthetic vegetation that the deer consumed.

After the process is complete, it releases oxygen and produces\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), as well as simple carbohydrate molecules (high in energy) that can then be converted into\nglucose, sucrose, or any of dozens of other sugar molecules. These sugar molecules contain energy and the energized carbon\nthat all living things need to survive.\nFigure 8.4 Photosynthesis uses solar energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce energy-storing carbohydrates. Oxygen is generated as a\nwaste product of photosynthesis.\n8.1 \u2022 Overview of Photosynthesis\n207\nThe following is the chemical equation for photosynthesis (Figure 8.5):\nFigure 8.5 The basic equation for photosynthesis is deceptively simple. In reality, the process takes place in many steps involving\nintermediate reactants and products. Glucose, the primary energy source in cells, is made from two three-carbon G3Ps.\nAlthough the equation looks simple, the many steps that take place during photosynthesis are actually quite complex. Before\nlearning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures\ninvolved.\nBasic Photosynthetic Structures\nIn plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. The process of photosynthesis\noccurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll. The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated\nopenings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. The\nstomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss due to high temperatures on the\nupper surface of the leaf. Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or\nshrinking in response to osmotic changes.\nIn all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast. For plants, chloroplast-\ncontaining cells exist mostly in the mesophyll. Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane\nand an inner membrane), and are ancestrally derived from ancient free-living cyanobacteria. Within the chloroplast are stacked,\ndisc-shaped structures called thylakoids. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a pigment (molecule that\nabsorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the\nelectron transport chain. The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen. As shown in Figure\n8.6, a stack of thylakoids is called a granum, and the liquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or \u201cbed\u201d (not to\nbe confused with stoma or \u201cmouth,\u201d an opening on the leaf epidermis).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 8.6 Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, which have an outer membrane and an inner membrane. Stacks of thylakoids called\ngrana form a third membrane layer.\nOn a hot, dry day, the guard cells of plants close their stomata to conserve water. What impact will this have on photosynthesis?\n208\nChapter 8 \u2022 Photosynthesis\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe Two Parts of Photosynthesis\nPhotosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. In the\nlight-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical\nenergy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the\nassembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. Therefore, although the light-independent reactions do not use light as a\nreactant, they require the products of the light-dependent reactions to function. In addition, however, several enzymes of the\nlight-independent reactions are activated by light. The light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily store\nthe energy: These are referred to as energy carriers. The energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent reactions to\nlight-independent reactions can be thought of as \u201cfull\u201d because they are rich in energy. After the energy is released, the \u201cempty\u201d\nenergy carriers return to the light-dependent reaction to obtain more energy. Figure 8.7 illustrates the components inside the\nchloroplast where the light-dependent and light-independent reactions take place.\nFigure 8.7 Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. Light-dependent reactions, which take\nplace in the thylakoid membrane, use light energy to make ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, uses energy\nderived from these compounds to make G3P from CO2.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick the link (http://openstax.org/l/photosynthesis) to learn more about photosynthesis.\nEveryday Connection\nPhotosynthesis at the Grocery Store\n8.1 \u2022 Overview of Photosynthesis\n209\n8.2 The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how plants absorb energy from sunlight\n\u2022\nDescribe short and long wavelengths of light\n\u2022\nDescribe how and where photosynthesis takes place within a plant\nHow can light energy be used to make food? When a person turns on a lamp, electrical energy becomes light energy. Like all\nother forms of kinetic energy, light can travel, change form, and be harnessed to do work. In the case of photosynthesis, light\nenergy is converted into chemical energy, which photoautotrophs use to build basic carbohydrate molecules (Figure 8.9).\nHowever, autotrophs only use a few specific wavelengths of sunlight.\nFigure 8.8 Foods that humans consume originate from photosynthesis. (credit: Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Supermercados)\nMajor grocery stores in the United States are organized into departments, such as dairy, meats, produce, bread, cereals, and\nso forth. Each aisle (Figure 8.8) contains hundreds, if not thousands, of different products for customers to buy and\nconsume.\nAlthough there is a large variety, each item ultimately can be linked back to photosynthesis. Meats and dairy link, because\nthe animals were fed plant-based foods. The breads, cereals, and pastas come largely from starchy grains, which are the\nseeds of photosynthesis-dependent plants. What about desserts and drinks? All of these products contain sugar\u2014sucrose is\na plant product, a disaccharide, a carbohydrate molecule, which is built directly from photosynthesis. Moreover, many items\nare less obviously derived from plants: For instance, paper goods are generally plant products, and many plastics (abundant\nas products and packaging) are derived from \u201calgae\u201d (unicellular plant-like organisms, and cyanobacteria). Virtually every\nspice and flavoring in the spice aisle was produced by a plant as a leaf, root, bark, flower, fruit, or stem. Ultimately,\nphotosynthesis connects to every meal and every food a person consumes.\n210\nChapter 8 \u2022 Photosynthesis\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 8.9 Photoautotrophs can capture visible light energy in specific wavelengths from the sun, converting it into the chemical energy\nused to build food molecules. (credit: Gerry Atwell)\nWhat Is Light Energy?\nThe sun emits an enormous amount of electromagnetic radiation (solar energy in a spectrum from very short gamma rays to\nvery long radio waves). Humans can see only a tiny fraction of this energy, which we refer to as \u201cvisible light.\u201d The manner in\nwhich solar energy travels is described as waves. Scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its\nwavelength (shorter wavelengths are more powerful than longer wavelengths)\u2014the distance between consecutive crest points of\na wave. Therefore, a single wave is measured from two consecutive points, such as from crest to crest or from trough to trough\n(Figure 8.10).\nFigure 8.10 The wavelength of a single wave is the distance between two consecutive points of similar position (two crests or two troughs)\nalong the wave.\nVisible light constitutes only one of many types of electromagnetic radiation emitted from the sun and other stars. Scientists\ndifferentiate the various types of radiant energy from the sun within the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic\nspectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of radiation (Figure 8.11). The difference between wavelengths relates to the\namount of energy carried by them.\n8.2 \u2022 The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis\n211\nFigure 8.11 The sun emits energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. This radiation exists at different wavelengths, each of which has\nits own characteristic energy. All electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, is characterized by its wavelength.\nEach type of electromagnetic radiation travels at a particular wavelength. The longer the wavelength, the less energy it carries.\nShort, tight waves carry the most energy. This may seem illogical, but think of it in terms of a piece of moving heavy rope. It\ntakes little effort by a person to move a rope in long, wide waves. To make a rope move in short, tight waves, a person would need\nto apply significantly more energy.\nThe electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 8.11) shows several types of electromagnetic radiation originating from the sun, including\nX-rays and ultraviolet (UV) rays. The higher-energy waves can penetrate tissues and damage cells and DNA, which explains why\nboth X-rays and UV rays can be harmful to living organisms.\nAbsorption of Light\nLight energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb specific wavelengths of visible light. Organic\npigments, whether in the human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb.\nEnergy levels lower than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a excited (quantum) state.\nEnergy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear the molecules apart, in a process called bleaching. Our retinal\npigments can only \u201csee\u201d (absorb) wavelengths between 700 nm and 400 nm of light, a spectrum that is therefore called visible\nlight. For the same reasons, plants, pigment molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant\nphysiologists refer to this range for plants as photosynthetically active radiation.\nThe visible light seen by humans as white light actually exists in a rainbow of colors. Certain objects, such as a prism or a drop of\nwater, disperse white light to reveal the colors to the human eye. The visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum shows\nthe rainbow of colors, with violet and blue having shorter wavelengths, and therefore higher energy. At the other end of the\nspectrum toward red, the wavelengths are longer and have lower energy (Figure 8.12).\n212\nChapter 8 \u2022 Photosynthesis\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 8.12 The colors of visible light do not carry the same amount of energy. Violet has the shortest wavelength and therefore carries the\nmost energy, whereas red has the longest wavelength and carries the least amount of energy. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nUnderstanding Pigments\nDifferent kinds of pigments exist, and each absorbs only specific wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments reflect or\ntransmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear a mixture of the reflected or transmitted light colors.\nChlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic pigments found in plants and algae; each class has\nmultiple types of pigment molecules. There are five major chlorophylls: a, b, c and d and a related molecule found in prokaryotes\ncalled bacteriochlorophyll. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the\nfollowing discussion.\nWith dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments. The carotenoids found in fruit\u2014such as the\nred of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (\u03b2-carotene)\u2014are used as\nadvertisements to attract seed dispersers. In photosynthesis, carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are very\nefficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. When a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions are\nrequired to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage.\nTherefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as heat.\nEach type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light: This is termed the\nabsorption spectrum. The graph in Figure 8.13 shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and a type of\ncarotenoid pigment called \u03b2-carotene (which absorbs blue and green light). Notice how each pigment has a distinct set of peaks\nand troughs, revealing a highly specific pattern of absorption. Chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible\nspectrum (blue and red), but not green. Because green is reflected or transmitted, chlorophyll appears green. Carotenoids\nabsorb in the short-wavelength blue region, and reflect the longer yellow, red, and orange wavelengths.\n8.2 \u2022 The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis\n213\nFigure 8.13 (a) Chlorophyll a, (b) chlorophyll b, and (c) \u03b2-carotene are hydrophobic organic pigments found in the thylakoid membrane.\nChlorophyll a and b, which are identical except for the part indicated in the red box, are responsible for the green color of leaves.\n\u03b2-carotene is responsible for the orange color in carrots. Each pigment has (d) a unique absorbance spectrum.\nMany photosynthetic organisms have a mixture of pigments, and by using these pigments, the organism can absorb energy\nfrom a wider range of wavelengths. Not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight. Some organisms grow\nunderwater where light intensity and quality decrease and change with depth. Other organisms grow in competition for light.\nPlants on the rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that comes through, because the taller trees absorb most of\nthe sunlight and scatter the remaining solar radiation (Figure 8.14).\nFigure 8.14 Plants that commonly grow in the shade have adapted to low levels of light by changing the relative concentrations of their\nchlorophyll pigments. (credit: Jason Hollinger)\nWhen studying a photosynthetic organism, scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating absorption\nspectra. An instrument called a spectrophotometer can differentiate which wavelengths of light a substance can absorb.\nSpectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption. By extracting pigments from leaves and\nplacing these samples into a spectrophotometer, scientists can identify which wavelengths of light an organism can absorb.\nAdditional methods for the identification of plant pigments include various types of chromatography that separate the\npigments by their relative affinities to solid and mobile phases.\n214\nChapter 8 \u2022 Photosynthesis\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nHow Light-Dependent Reactions Work\nThe overall function of light-dependent reactions is to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP.\nThis chemical energy supports the light-independent reactions and fuels the assembly of sugar molecules. The light-dependent\nreactions are depicted in Figure 8.15. Protein complexes and pigment molecules work together to produce NADPH and ATP. The\nnumbering of the photosystems is derived from the order in which they were discovered, not in the order of the transfer of\nelectrons.\nFigure 8.15 A photosystem consists of 1) a light-harvesting complex and 2) a reaction center. Pigments in the light-harvesting complex\npass light energy to two special chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction center. The light excites an electron from the chlorophyll a pair,\nwhich passes to the primary electron acceptor. The excited electron must then be replaced. In (a) photosystem II, the electron comes from\nthe splitting of water, which releases oxygen as a waste product. In (b) photosystem I, the electron comes from the chloroplast electron\ntransport chain discussed below.\nThe actual step that converts light energy into chemical energy takes place in a multiprotein complex called a photosystem, two\ntypes of which are found embedded in the thylakoid membrane: photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) (Figure 8.16).\nThe two complexes differ on the basis of what they oxidize (that is, the source of the low-energy electron supply) and what they\nreduce (the place to which they deliver their energized electrons).\nBoth photosystems have the same basic structure; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound\nsurround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place. Each photosystem is serviced by the light-harvesting\ncomplex, which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a\nmixture of 300 to 400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids. The absorption of a single\nphoton or distinct quantity or \u201cpacket\u201d of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state. In short, the\n8.2 \u2022 The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis\n215\nlight energy has now been captured by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet. The energy is transferred\nfrom chlorophyll to chlorophyll until eventually (after about a millionth of a second), it is delivered to the reaction center. Up to\nthis point, only energy has been transferred between molecules, not electrons.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 8.16 In the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, energy from sunlight is used to extract electrons from water. The electrons travel\nthrough the chloroplast electron transport chain to photosystem I (PSI), which reduces NADP+ to NADPH. The electron transport chain\nmoves protons across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. At the same time, splitting of water adds protons to the lumen, and\nreduction of NADPH removes protons from the stroma. The net result is a low pH in the thylakoid lumen, and a high pH in the stroma. ATP\nsynthase uses this electrochemical gradient to make ATP.\nWhat is the initial source of electrons for the chloroplast electron transport chain?\na.\nwater\nb.\noxygen\nc.\ncarbon dioxide\nd.\nNADPH\nThe reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property. Those two chlorophylls can undergo\noxidation upon excitation; they can actually give up an electron in a process called a photoact. It is at this step in the reaction\ncenter during photosynthesis that light energy is converted into an excited electron. All of the subsequent steps involve getting\nthat electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for\nlong-term storage in the form of a carbohydrate. PSII and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic electron\ntransport chain, which also includes the cytochrome complex. The cytochrome complex, an enzyme composed of two protein\ncomplexes, transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone (Pq) to the protein plastocyanin (Pc), thus enabling\nboth the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to PSI.\nThe reaction center of PSII (called P680) delivers its high-energy electrons, one at the time, to the primary electron acceptor,\nand through the electron transport chain (Pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine) to PSI. P680\u2019s missing electron is\nreplaced by extracting a low-energy electron from water; thus, water is \u201csplit\u201d during this stage of photosynthesis, and PSII is re-\nreduced after every photoact. Splitting one H2O molecule releases two electrons, two hydrogen atoms, and one atom of oxygen.\nHowever, splitting two molecules is required to form one molecule of diatomic O2 gas. About 10 percent of the oxygen is used by\n216\nChapter 8 \u2022 Photosynthesis\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nmitochondria in the leaf to support oxidative phosphorylation. The remainder escapes to the atmosphere where it is used by\naerobic organisms to support respiration.\nAs electrons move through the proteins that reside between PSII and PSI, they lose energy. This energy is used to move hydrogen\natoms from the stromal side of the membrane to the thylakoid lumen. Those hydrogen atoms, plus the ones produced by\nsplitting water, accumulate in the thylakoid lumen and will be used synthesize ATP in a later step. Because the electrons have\nlost energy prior to their arrival at PSI, they must be re-energized by PSI, hence, another photon is absorbed by the PSI antenna.\nThat energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center (called P700). P700 is oxidized and sends a high-energy electron to NADP+ to\nform NADPH. Thus, PSII captures the energy to create proton gradients to make ATP, and PSI captures the energy to reduce\nNADP+ into NADPH. The two photosystems work in concert, in part, to guarantee that the production of NADPH will roughly\nequal the production of ATP. Other mechanisms exist to fine-tune that ratio to exactly match the chloroplast\u2019s constantly\nchanging energy needs.\nGenerating an Energy Carrier: ATP\nAs in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during cellular respiration, the buildup of hydrogen ions inside the\nthylakoid lumen creates a concentration gradient. The passive diffusion of hydrogen ions from high concentration (in the\nthylakoid lumen) to low concentration (in the stroma) is harnessed to create ATP, just as in the electron transport chain of\ncellular respiration. The ions build up energy because of diffusion and because they all have the same electrical charge, repelling\neach other.\nTo release this energy, hydrogen ions will rush through any opening, similar to water jetting through a hole in a dam. In the\nthylakoid, that opening is a passage through a specialized protein channel called the ATP synthase. The energy released by the\nhydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate group to ADP, which forms a molecule of ATP (Figure\n8.16). The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis because the ions move from an area of high to an\narea of low concentration through a semi-permeable structure of the thylakoid.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/light_reactions) and click through the animation to view the process of photosynthesis\nwithin a leaf.\n8.3 Using Light Energy to Make Organic Molecules\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the Calvin cycle\n\u2022\nDefine carbon fixation\n\u2022\nExplain how photosynthesis works in the energy cycle of all living organisms\nAfter the energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy and temporarily stored in ATP and NADPH molecules, the cell\nhas the fuel needed to build carbohydrate molecules for long-term energy storage. The products of the light-dependent\nreactions, ATP and NADPH, have lifespans in the range of millionths of seconds, whereas the products of the light-independent\nreactions (carbohydrates and other forms of reduced carbon) can survive almost indefinitely. The carbohydrate molecules made\nwill have a backbone of carbon atoms. But where does the carbon come from? It comes from carbon dioxide\u2014the gas that is a\nwaste product of respiration in microbes, fungi, plants, and animals.\nThe Calvin Cycle\nIn plants, carbon dioxide (CO2) enters the leaves through stomata, where it diffuses over short distances through intercellular\nspaces until it reaches the mesophyll cells. Once in the mesophyll cells, CO2 diffuses into the stroma of the chloroplast\u2014the site\nof light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions actually have several names associated with them. Another\nterm, the Calvin cycle, is named for the man who discovered it, and because these reactions function as a cycle. Others call it the\nCalvin-Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery. The most outdated name is \u201cdark\nreaction,\u201d because light is not directly required (Figure 8.17). However, the term dark reaction can be misleading because it\nimplies incorrectly that the reaction only occurs at night or is independent of light, which is why most scientists and instructors\nno longer use it.\n8.3 \u2022 Using Light Energy to Make Organic Molecules\n217\nFigure 8.17 Light reactions harness energy from the sun to produce chemical bonds, ATP, and NADPH. These energy-carrying molecules\nare made in the stroma where carbon fixation takes place.\nThe light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and\nregeneration.\nStage 1: Fixation\nIn the stroma, in addition to CO2,two other components are present to initiate the light-independent reactions: an enzyme\ncalled ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), and three molecules of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), as\nshown in Figure 8.18. RuBP has five atoms of carbon, flanked by two phosphates.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 8.18 The Calvin cycle has three stages. In stage 1, the enzyme RuBisCO incorporates carbon dioxide into an organic molecule,\n3-PGA. In stage 2, the organic molecule is reduced using electrons supplied by NADPH. In stage 3, RuBP, the molecule that starts the cycle,\n218\nChapter 8 \u2022 Photosynthesis\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nis regenerated so that the cycle can continue. Only one carbon dioxide molecule is incorporated at a time, so the cycle must be completed\nthree times to produce a single three-carbon G3P molecule, and six times to produce a six-carbon glucose molecule.\nWhich of the following statements is true?\na.\nIn photosynthesis, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH are reactants. G3P and water are products.\nb.\nIn photosynthesis, chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide are reactants. G3P and oxygen are products.\nc.\nIn photosynthesis, water, carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH are reactants. RuBP and oxygen are products.\nd.\nIn photosynthesis, water and carbon dioxide are reactants. G3P and oxygen are products.\nRuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO2 and RuBP. For each CO2 molecule that reacts with one RuBP, two molecules of\nanother compound 3-phospho glyceric acid (3-PGA) form. PGA has three carbons and one phosphate. Each turn of the cycle\ninvolves only one RuBP and one carbon dioxide and forms two molecules of 3-PGA. The number of carbon atoms remains the\nsame, as the atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions (3 C atoms from 3CO2 + 15 C atoms from 3RuBP = 18 C atoms\nin 6 molecules of 3-PGA). This process is called carbon fixation, because CO2 is \u201cfixed\u201d from an inorganic form into organic\nmolecules.\nStage 2: Reduction\nATP and NADPH are used to convert the six molecules of 3-PGA into six molecules of a chemical called glyceraldehyde\n3-phosphate (G3P). That is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by 3-PGA. (Recall that a reduction is the\ngain of an electron by an atom or molecule.) Six molecules of both ATP and NADPH are used. For ATP, energy is released with\nthe loss of the terminal phosphate atom, converting it into ADP; for NADPH, both energy and a hydrogen atom are lost,\nconverting it into NADP+. Both of these molecules return to the nearby light-dependent reactions to be reused and re-\nenergized.\nStage 3: Regeneration\nInterestingly, at this point, only one of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle and is sent to the cytoplasm to contribute to the\nformation of other compounds needed by the plant. Because the G3P exported from the chloroplast has three carbon atoms, it\ntakes three \u201cturns\u201d of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one G3P. But each turn makes two G3Ps, thus three\nturns make six G3Ps. One is exported while the remaining five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used to regenerate\nRuBP, which enables the system to prepare for more CO2 to be fixed. Three more molecules of ATP are used in these\nregeneration reactions.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis link (http://openstax.org/l/calvin_cycle) leads to an animation of photosynthesis and the Calvin cycle.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nPhotosynthesis\nDuring the evolution of photosynthesis, a major shift occurred from the bacterial type of photosynthesis that involves only one\nphotosystem and is typically anoxygenic (does not generate oxygen) into modern oxygenic (does generate oxygen)\nphotosynthesis, employing two photosystems. This modern oxygenic photosynthesis is used by many organisms\u2014from giant\ntropical leaves in the rainforest to tiny cyanobacterial cells\u2014and the process and components of this photosynthesis remain\nlargely the same. Photosystems absorb light and use electron transport chains to convert energy into the chemical energy of ATP\nand NADH. The subsequent light-independent reactions then assemble carbohydrate molecules with this energy.\nIn the harsh dry heat of the desert, plants must conserve every drop of water must be used to survive. Because stomata must\nopen to allow for the uptake of CO2, water escapes from the leaf during active photosynthesis. Desert plants have evolved\nprocesses to conserve water and deal with harsh conditions. Mechanisms to capture and store CO2 allows plants to adapt to\nliving with less water. Some plants such as cacti (Figure 8.19) can prepare materials for photosynthesis during the night by a\ntemporary carbon fixation/storage process, because opening the stomata at this time conserves water due to cooler\ntemperatures. During the day cacti use the captured CO2 for photosynthesis, and keep their stomata closed.\n8.3 \u2022 Using Light Energy to Make Organic Molecules\n219\nFigure 8.19 The harsh conditions of the desert have led plants like these cacti to evolve variations of the light-independent reactions of\nphotosynthesis. These variations increase the efficiency of water usage, helping to conserve water and energy.

But if plants make carbohydrate molecules, why would they need to break them down, especially\nwhen it has been shown that the gas organisms release as a \u201cwaste product\u201d (CO2) acts as a substrate for the formation of more\nfood in photosynthesis? Remember, living things need energy to perform life functions. In addition, an organism can either\nmake its own food or eat another organism\u2014either way, the food still needs to be broken down. Finally, in the process of\nbreaking down food, called cellular respiration, heterotrophs release needed energy and produce \u201cwaste\u201d in the form of CO2 gas.\nHowever, in nature, there is no such thing as \u201cwaste.\u201d Every single atom of matter and energy is conserved, recycled over and\nover infinitely. Substances change form or move from one type of molecule to another, but their constituent atoms never\ndisappear (Figure 8.20).\nIn reality, CO2 is no more a form of waste than oxygen is wasteful to photosynthesis. Both are byproducts of reactions that move\non to other reactions. Photosynthesis absorbs light energy to build carbohydrates in chloroplasts, and aerobic cellular\nrespiration releases energy by using oxygen to metabolize carbohydrates in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Both processes use\nelectron transport chains to capture the energy necessary to drive other reactions. These two powerhouse processes,\nphotosynthesis and cellular respiration, function in biological, cyclical harmony to allow organisms to access life-sustaining\nenergy that originates millions of miles away in a burning star humans call the sun.\n220\nChapter 8 \u2022 Photosynthesis\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 8.20 Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide and produces oxygen.

By\nharnessing energy from the sun, the evolution of\nphotosynthesis allowed living things access to enormous\namounts of energy. Because of photosynthesis, living things\ngained access to sufficient energy that allowed them to build\nnew structures and achieve the biodiversity evident today.\nOnly certain organisms (photoautotrophs), can perform\nphotosynthesis; they require the presence of chlorophyll, a\nspecialized pigment that absorbs certain wavelengths of the\nvisible spectrum and can capture energy from sunlight.\nPhotosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to assemble\ncarbohydrate molecules and release oxygen as a byproduct\ninto the atmosphere. Eukaryotic autotrophs, such as plants\nand algae, have organelles called chloroplasts in which\nphotosynthesis takes place, and starch accumulates. In\nprokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, the process is less\nlocalized and occurs within folded membranes, extensions of\nthe plasma membrane, and in the cytoplasm.\n8.2 The Light-Dependent Reactions\nof Photosynthesis\nThe pigments of the first part of photosynthesis, the light-\ndependent reactions, absorb energy from sunlight. A photon\nstrikes the antenna pigments of photosystem II to initiate\nphotosynthesis. The energy travels to the reaction center that\ncontains chlorophyll a and then to the electron transport\nchain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid\ninterior. This action builds up a high concentration of\nhydrogen ions. The hydrogen ions flow through ATP synthase\nduring chemiosmosis to form molecules of ATP, which are\nused for the formation of sugar molecules in the second\nstage of photosynthesis. Photosystem I absorbs a second\nphoton, which results in the formation of an NADPH\nmolecule, another energy and reducing carrier for the light-\nindependent reactions.\n8.3 Using Light Energy to Make\nOrganic Molecules\nUsing the energy carriers formed in the first steps of\nphotosynthesis, the light-independent reactions, or the\nCalvin cycle, take in CO2 from the atmosphere. An enzyme,\nRuBisCO, catalyzes a reaction with CO2 and another organic\ncompound, RuBP. After three cycles, a three-carbon\nmolecule of G3P leaves the cycle to become part of a\ncarbohydrate molecule. The remaining G3P molecules stay in\nthe cycle to be regenerated into RuBP, which is then ready to\nreact with more CO2. Photosynthesis forms an energy cycle\nwith the process of cellular respiration. Because plants\ncontain both chloroplasts and mitochondria, they rely upon\nboth photosynthesis and respiration for their ability to\nfunction in both the light and dark, and to be able to\ninterconvert essential metabolites.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

(credit: modification of work by Vincent and Bella Productions)\nINTRODUCTION Imagine what life would be like if you and the people around you could not\ncommunicate. You would not be able to express your wishes to others, nor could you ask questions about\nyour location. Social organization is dependent on communication between the individuals that\ncomprise that society; without communication, society would fall apart.\nAs with people, it is vital for individual cells to be able to interact with their environment. This is true for\nboth a one-celled organism growing in a puddle and a large animal living on a savanna. In order to\nproperly respond to external stimuli, cells have developed complex mechanisms of communication that\ncan receive a message, transfer the information across the plasma membrane, and then produce changes\nwithin the cell in response to the message.\nIn multicellular organisms, cells send and receive chemical messages constantly to coordinate the\nactions of distant organs, tissues, and cells. The ability to send messages quickly and efficiently enables\ncells to coordinate and fine-tune their functions.\nWhile the necessity for cellular communication in larger organisms seems obvious, even single-celled\norganisms communicate with each other. Yeast cells signal each other to aid in finding other yeast cells\nfor reproduction. Some forms of bacteria coordinate their actions in order to form large complexes\ncalled biofilms or to organize the production of toxins to remove competing organisms. The ability of\ncells to communicate through chemical signals originated in single cells and was essential for the\nevolution of multicellular organisms. The efficient and relatively error-free function of communication\nsystems is vital for all life as we know it.\nChapter Outline\n9.1 Signaling Molecules\nand Cellular\nReceptors\n9.2 Propagation of the\nSignal\n9.3 Response to the\nSignal\n9.4 Signaling in Single-\nCelled Organisms\n9.1 Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe four types of signaling mechanisms found in multicellular organisms\n\u2022\nCompare internal receptors with cell-surface receptors\n\u2022\nRecognize the relationship between a ligand\u2019s structure and its mechanism of action\nThere are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells. Communication between cells is called\nintercellular signaling, and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling. An easy way to\nremember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes: inter- means \"between\" (for\nexample, intersecting lines are those that cross each other) and intra- means \"inside\" (as in intravenous).\nChemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small, usually volatile or soluble molecules\ncalled ligands. A ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule, in some cases, delivering a signal\nin the process. Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules. Ligands interact with proteins in\ntarget cells, which are cells that are affected by chemical signals; these proteins are also called receptors.\nLigands and receptors exist in several varieties; however, a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that\ntypically binds only that ligand.\nForms of Signaling\nThere are four categories of chemical signaling found in multicellular organisms: paracrine signaling,\nendocrine signaling, autocrine signaling, and direct signaling across gap junctions (Figure 9.2). The main\ndifference between the different categories of signaling is the distance that the signal travels through the\norganism to reach the target cell. We should note here that not all cells are affected by the same signals.\nFigure 9.2 In chemical signaling, a cell may target itself (autocrine signaling), a cell connected by gap junctions, a\nnearby cell (paracrine signaling), or a distant cell (endocrine signaling). Paracrine signaling acts on nearby cells,\nendocrine signaling uses the circulatory system to transport ligands, and autocrine signaling acts on the signaling cell.\nSignaling via gap junctions involves signaling molecules moving directly between adjacent cells.\n228\nChapter 9 \u2022 Cell Communication\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nParacrine Signaling\nSignals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals. Paracrine signals move by diffusion\nthrough the extracellular matrix. These types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short period of time. In\norder to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by\nneighboring cells. Removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly\ndiffuse through the intracellular space if released again.\nOne example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. A nerve cell consists of a cell\nbody, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which\ntransmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called\na synapse. A synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by\nfast-moving electrical impulses. When these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the\nnext cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters from the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). The\nneurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances (20\u201340 nanometers) between nerve cells, which are called\nchemical synapses (Figure 9.3). The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an\nimmediate response, such as, \"Take your hand off the stove!\"\nWhen the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target\ncell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. The neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are\ndegraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to\nrespond rapidly to the next synaptic signal.\nFigure 9.3 The distance between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cell\u2014called the synaptic gap\u2014is very small and allows for rapid\ndiffusion of the neurotransmitter. Enzymes in the synapatic gap degrade some types of neurotransmitters to terminate the signal.\nEndocrine Signaling\nSignals from distant cells are called endocrine signals, and they originate from endocrine cells. (In the body, many endocrine\ncells are located in endocrine glands, such as the thyroid gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland.) These types of\nsignals usually produce a slower response but have a longer-lasting effect. The ligands released in endocrine signaling are called\nhormones, signaling molecules that are produced in one part of the body but affect other body regions some distance away.\nHormones travel the large distances between endocrine cells and their target cells via the bloodstream, which is a relatively slow\nway to move throughout the body. Because of their form of transport, hormones become diluted and are present in low\nconcentrations when they act on their target cells. This is different from paracrine signaling, in which local concentrations of\n9.1 \u2022 Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors\n229\nligands can be very high.\nAutocrine Signaling\nAutocrine signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released. This means the signaling cell\nand the target cell can be the same or a similar cell (the prefix auto- means self, a reminder that the signaling cell sends a signal\nto itself). This type of signaling often occurs during the early development of an organism to ensure that cells develop into the\ncorrect tissues and take on the proper function. Autocrine signaling also regulates pain sensation and inflammatory responses.\nFurther, if a cell is infected with a virus, the cell can signal itself to undergo programmed cell death, killing the virus in the\nprocess. In some cases, neighboring cells of the same type are also influenced by the released ligand. In embryological\ndevelopment, this process of stimulating a group of neighboring cells may help to direct the differentiation of identical cells into\nthe same cell type, thus ensuring the proper developmental outcome.\nDirect Signaling Across Gap Junctions\nGap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of neighboring cells.\nThese fluid-filled channels allow small signaling molecules, called intracellular mediators, to diffuse between the two cells.\nSmall molecules or ions, such as calcium ions (Ca2+), are able to move between cells, but large molecules like proteins and DNA\ncannot fit through the channels. The specificity of the channels ensures that the cells remain independent but can quickly and\neasily transmit signals. The transfer of signaling molecules communicates the current state of the cell that is directly next to the\ntarget cell; this allows a group of cells to coordinate their response to a signal that only one of them may have received. In plants,\nplasmodesmata are ubiquitous, making the entire plant into a giant communication network.\nTypes of Receptors\nReceptors are protein molecules in the target cell or on its surface that bind ligand. There are two types of receptors, internal\nreceptors and cell-surface receptors.\nInternal receptors\nInternal receptors, also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors, are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond to\nhydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane. Once inside the cell, many of these molecules\nbind to proteins that act as regulators of mRNA synthesis (transcription) to mediate gene expression. Gene expression is the\ncellular process of transforming the information in a cell's DNA into a sequence of amino acids, which ultimately forms a\nprotein. When the ligand binds to the internal receptor, a conformational change is triggered that exposes a DNA-binding site\non the protein. The ligand-receptor complex moves into the nucleus, then binds to specific regulatory regions of the\nchromosomal DNA and promotes the initiation of transcription (Figure 9.4). Transcription is the process of copying the\ninformation in a cell's DNA into a special form of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA); the cell uses information in the mRNA\n(which moves out into the cytoplasm and associates with ribosomes) to link specific amino acids in the correct order, producing\na protein. Internal receptors can directly influence gene expression without having to pass the signal on to other receptors or\nmessengers.\n230\nChapter 9 \u2022 Cell Communication\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 9.4 Hydrophobic signaling molecules typically diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with intracellular receptors in the\ncytoplasm. Many intracellular receptors are transcription factors that interact with DNA in the nucleus and regulate gene expression.\nCell-Surface Receptors\nCell-surface receptors, also known as transmembrane receptors, are cell surface, membrane-anchored (integral) proteins that\nbind to external ligand molecules. This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction, through\nwhich an extracellular signal is converted into an intracellular signal. Ligands that interact with cell-surface receptors do not\nhave to enter the cell that they affect. Cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because they are\nspecific to individual cell types.\nBecause cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a\nmalfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences. Errors in the protein structures of certain receptor\nmolecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, heart disease, and cancer.\nEach cell-surface receptor has three main components: an external ligand-binding domain called the extracellular domain, a\nhydrophobic membrane-spanning region called a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain inside the cell. The size\nand extent of each of these domains vary widely, depending on the type of receptor.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nHow Viruses Recognize a Host\nUnlike living cells, many viruses do not have a plasma membrane or any of the structures necessary to sustain metabolic life.\nSome viruses are simply composed of an inert protein shell enclosing DNA or RNA. To reproduce, viruses must invade a living\ncell, which serves as a host, and then take over the hosts cellular apparatus. But how does a virus recognize its host?\nViruses often bind to cell-surface receptors on the host cell. For example, the virus that causes human influenza (flu) binds\nspecifically to receptors on membranes of cells of the respiratory system. Chemical differences in the cell-surface receptors\namong hosts mean that a virus that infects a specific species (for example, humans) often cannot infect another species (for\nexample, chickens).\nHowever, viruses have very small amounts of DNA or RNA compared to humans, and, as a result, viral reproduction can occur\nrapidly. Viral reproduction invariably produces errors that can lead to changes in newly produced viruses; these changes mean\nthat the viral proteins that interact with cell-surface receptors may evolve in such a way that they can bind to receptors in a new\nhost. Such changes happen randomly and quite often in the reproductive cycle of a virus, but the changes only matter if a virus\nwith new binding properties comes into contact with a suitable host. In the case of influenza, this situation can occur in settings\nwhere animals and people are in close contact, such as poultry and swine farms.1 Once a virus jumps the former \"species barrier\"\nto a new host, it can spread quickly. Scientists watch newly appearing viruses (called emerging viruses) closely in the hope that\n9.1 \u2022 Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors\n231\n1A. B. Sigalov, The School of Nature. IV.

There are three general categories of cell-\nsurface receptors: ion channel-linked receptors, G-protein-linked receptors, and enzyme-linked receptors.\nIon channel-linked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass through.\nTo form a channel, this type of cell-surface receptor has an extensive membrane-spanning region. In order to interact with the\ndouble layer of phospholipid fatty acid tails that form the center of the plasma membrane, many of the amino acids in the\nmembrane-spanning region are hydrophobic in nature. Conversely, the amino acids that line the inside of the channel are\nhydrophilic to allow for the passage of water or ions. When a ligand binds to the extracellular region of the channel, there is a\nconformational change in the protein's structure that allows ions such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen to pass\nthrough (Figure 9.5).\nFigure 9.5 Gated ion channels form a pore through the plasma membrane that opens when the signaling molecule binds. The open pore\nthen allows ions to flow into or out of the cell.\nG-protein-linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a G-protein. The activated G-protein then\ninteracts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane (Figure 9.6). All G-protein-linked receptors have seven\ntransmembrane domains, but each receptor has its own specific extracellular domain and G-protein-binding site.\nCell signaling using G-protein-linked receptors occurs as a cyclic series of events. Before the ligand binds, the inactive G-protein\ncan bind to a newly revealed site on the receptor specific for its binding. Once the G-protein binds to the receptor, the resulting\nchange in shape activates the G-protein, which releases guanosine diposphate (GDP) and picks up guanosine 3-phosphate\n(GTP). The subunits of the G-protein then split into the \u03b1 subunit and the \u03b2\u03b3 subunit. One or both of these G-protein fragments\nmay be able to activate other proteins as a result. After awhile, the GTP on the active \u03b1 subunit of the G-protein is hydrolyzed to\nGDP and the \u03b2\u03b3 subunit is deactivated. The subunits reassociate to form the inactive G-protein and the cycle begins anew.\n232\nChapter 9 \u2022 Cell Communication\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 9.6 Heterotrimeric G-proteins have three subunits: \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. When a signaling molecule binds to a G-protein-coupled receptor in\nthe plasma membrane, a GDP molecule associated with the \u03b1 subunit is exchanged for GTP. The \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits dissociate from the \u03b1\nsubunit, and a cellular response is triggered either by the \u03b1 subunit or the dissociated \u03b2\u03b3 pair. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP terminates the\nsignal.\nG-protein-linked receptors have been extensively studied and much has been learned about their roles in maintaining health.\nBacteria that are pathogenic to humans can release poisons that interrupt specific G-protein-linked receptor function, leading\nto illnesses such as pertussis, botulism, and cholera. In cholera (Figure 9.7), for example, the water-borne bacterium Vibrio\ncholerae produces a toxin, choleragen, that binds to cells lining the small intestine. The toxin then enters these intestinal cells,\nwhere it modifies a G-protein that controls the opening of a chloride channel and causes it to remain continuously active,\nresulting in large losses of fluids from the body and potentially fatal dehydration as a result.\n9.1 \u2022 Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors\n233\nFigure 9.7 Transmitted primarily through contaminated drinking water, cholera is a major cause of death in the developing world and in\nareas where natural disasters interrupt the availability of clean water. The cholera bacterium, Vibrio cholerae, creates a toxin that modifies\nG-protein-mediated cell signaling pathways in the intestines. Modern sanitation eliminates the threat of cholera outbreaks, such as the one\nthat swept through New York City in 1866. This poster from that era shows how, at that time, the way that the disease was transmitted was\nnot understood. (credit: New York City Sanitary Commission)\nEnzyme-linked receptors are cell-surface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an enzyme. In some\ncases, the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme. Other enzyme-linked receptors have a small intracellular\ndomain that interacts directly with an enzyme. The enzyme-linked receptors normally have large extracellular and intracellular\ndomains, but the membrane-spanning region consists of a single alpha-helical region of the peptide strand. When a ligand\nbinds to the extracellular domain, a signal is transferred through the membrane, activating the enzyme. Activation of the\nenzyme sets off a chain of events within the cell that eventually leads to a response. One example of this type of enzyme-linked\nreceptor is the tyrosine kinase receptor (Figure 9.8). A kinase is an enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from ATP to another\nprotein. The tyrosine kinase receptor transfers phosphate groups to tyrosine molecules (tyrosine residues). First, signaling\nmolecules bind to the extracellular domain of two nearby tyrosine kinase receptors. The two neighboring receptors then bond\ntogether, or dimerize. Phosphates are then added to tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain of the receptors\n(phosphorylation). The phosphorylated residues can then transmit the signal to the next messenger within the cytoplasm.\n234\nChapter 9 \u2022 Cell Communication\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 9.8 A receptor tyrosine kinase is an enzyme-linked receptor with a single helical transmembrane region, and extracellular and\nintracellular domains. Binding of a signaling molecule to the extracellular domain causes the receptor to dimerize. Tyrosine residues on the\nintracellular domain are then autophosphorylated, triggering a downstream cellular response. The signal is terminated by a phosphatase\nthat removes the phosphates from the phosphotyrosine residues.\nHER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase. In 30 percent of human breast cancers, HER2 is permanently activated, resulting in\nunregulated cell division. Lapatinib, a drug used to treat breast cancer, inhibits HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase\nautophosphorylation (the process by which the receptor adds phosphates onto itself), thus reducing tumor growth by 50\npercent. Besides autophosphorylation, which of the following steps would be inhibited by Lapatinib?\na.\nSignaling molecule binding, dimerization, and the downstream cellular response\nb.\nDimerization, and the downstream cellular response\nc.\nThe downstream cellular response\nd.\nPhosphatase activity, dimerization, and the downsteam cellular response\nSignaling Molecules\nProduced by signaling cells and the subsequent binding to receptors in target cells, ligands act as chemical signals that travel to\nthe target cells to coordinate responses. The types of molecules that serve as ligands are incredibly varied and range from small\nproteins to small ions like calcium (Ca2+).\n9.1 \u2022 Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors\n235\nSmall Hydrophobic Ligands\nSmall hydrophobic ligands can directly diffuse through the plasma membrane and interact with internal receptors. Important\nmembers of this class of ligands are the steroid hormones. Steroids are lipids that have a hydrocarbon skeleton with four fused\nrings; different steroids have different functional groups attached to the carbon skeleton. Steroid hormones include the female\nsex hormone, estradiol, which is a type of estrogen; the male sex hormone, testosterone; and cholesterol, which is an important\nstructural component of biological membranes and a precursor of steriod hormones (Figure 9.9). Other hydrophobic hormones\ninclude thyroid hormones and vitamin D. In order to be soluble in blood, hydrophobic ligands must bind to carrier proteins\nwhile they are being transported through the bloodstream.\nFigure 9.9 Steroid hormones have similar chemical structures to their precursor, cholesterol. Because these molecules are small and\nhydrophobic, they can diffuse directly across the plasma membrane into the cell, where they interact with internal receptors.\nWater-Soluble Ligands\nWater-soluble ligands are polar and, therefore, cannot pass through the plasma membrane unaided; sometimes, they are too\nlarge to pass through the membrane at all. Instead, most water-soluble ligands bind to the extracellular domain of cell-surface\nreceptors. This group of ligands is quite diverse and includes small molecules, peptides, and proteins.\nOther Ligands\nNitric oxide (NO) is a gas that also acts as a ligand. It is able to diffuse directly across the plasma membrane, and one of its roles\nis to interact with receptors in smooth muscle and induce relaxation of the tissue. NO has a very short half-life and, therefore,\nonly functions over short distances. Nitroglycerin, a treatment for heart disease, acts by triggering the release of NO, which\ncauses blood vessels to dilate (expand), thus restoring blood flow to the heart. NO has become better known recently because the\npathway that it affects is targeted by prescription medications for erectile dysfunction, such as Viagra (erection involves dilated\nblood vessels).\n9.2 Propagation of the Signal\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how the binding of a ligand initiates signal transduction throughout a cell\n\u2022\nRecognize the role of phosphorylation in the transmission of intracellular signals\n\u2022\nEvaluate the role of second messengers in signal transmission\nOnce a ligand binds to a receptor, the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm. Continuation of a\nsignal in this manner is called signal transduction. Signal transduction only occurs with cell-surface receptors, which cannot\ninteract with most components of the cell such as DNA. Only internal receptors are able to interact directly with DNA in the\nnucleus to initiate protein synthesis.\nWhen a ligand binds to its receptor, conformational changes occur that affect the receptor\u2019s intracellular domain.\n236\nChapter 9 \u2022 Cell Communication\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nConformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the\nreceptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins. In some cases, binding of the ligand causes\ndimerization of the receptor, which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer. A\ndimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules (often identical) join together. The binding of the receptors in this\nmanner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other.\nBinding Initiates a Signaling Pathway\nAfter the ligand binds to the cell-surface receptor, the activation of the receptor\u2019s intracellular components sets off a chain of\nevents that is called a signaling pathway, sometimes called a signaling cascade. In a signaling pathway, second\nmessengers\u2013enzymes\u2013and activated proteins interact with specific proteins, which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that\neventually leads to a change in the cell\u2019s environment (Figure 9.10), such as an increase in metabolism or specific gene\nexpression. The events in the cascade occur in a series, much like a current flows in a river. Interactions that occur before a\ncertain point are defined as upstream events, and events after that point are called downstream events.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 9.10 The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the regulation of cell growth,\nwound healing, and tissue repair. When EGF binds to the EGFR, a cascade of downstream events causes the cell to grow and divide. If EGFR\n9.2 \u2022 Propagation of the Signal\n237\nis activated at inappropriate times, uncontrolled cell growth (cancer) may occur.\nIn certain cancers, the GTPase activity of the RAS G-protein is inhibited. This means that the RAS protein can no longer\nhydrolyze GTP into GDP. What effect would this have on downstream cellular events?\nYou can see that signaling pathways can get very complicated very quickly because most cellular proteins can affect different\ndownstream events, depending on the conditions within the cell. A single pathway can branch off toward different endpoints\nbased on the interplay between two or more signaling pathways, and the same ligands are often used to initiate different signals\nin different cell types. This variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types. Another\ncomplicating element is signal integration of the pathways, in which signals from two or more different cell-surface receptors\nmerge to activate the same response in the cell. This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell\ncommits to a specific response.\nThe effects of extracellular signals can also be amplified by enzymatic cascades. At the initiation of the signal, a single ligand\nbinds to a single receptor. However, activation of a receptor-linked enzyme can activate many copies of a component of the\nsignaling cascade, which amplifies the signal.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nObserve an animation of cell signaling at this site (http://openstax.org/l/cell_signals) .\nMethods of Intracellular Signaling\nThe induction of a signaling pathway depends on the modification of a cellular component by an enzyme. There are numerous\nenzymatic modifications that can occur, and they are recognized in turn by the next component downstream. The following are\nsome of the more common events in intracellular signaling.\nPhosphorylation\nOne of the most common chemical modifications that occurs in signaling pathways is the addition of a phosphate group (PO4\u20133)\nto a molecule such as a protein in a process called phosphorylation. The phosphate can be added to a nucleotide such as GMP to\nform GDP or GTP. Phosphates are also often added to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of proteins, where they replace\nthe hydroxyl group of the amino acid (Figure 9.11). The transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an enzyme called a kinase.\nVarious kinases are named for the substrate they phosphorylate. Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues often\nactivates enzymes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues can either affect the activity of an enzyme or create a binding site that\ninteracts with downstream components in the signaling cascade. Phosphorylation may activate or inactivate enzymes, and the\nreversal of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation by a phosphatase, will reverse the effect.\n238\nChapter 9 \u2022 Cell Communication\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 9.11 In protein phosphorylation, a phosphate group (PO4 -3) is added to residues of the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine.\nSecond Messengers\nSecond messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling\nmolecule to the receptor. These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain\ncellular proteins.\nCalcium ion is a widely used second messenger. The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a cell is very low because\nion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously remove it by using adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP). For signaling purposes,\nCa2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When signaling\noccurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular\nstorage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+. The response to the\nincrease in Ca2+ varies and depends on the cell type involved. For example, in the \u03b2-cells of the pancreas, Ca2+ signaling leads to\nthe release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in Ca2+ leads to muscle contractions.\nAnother second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme\nadenylyl cyclase from ATP (Figure 9.12). The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called cAMP-\ndependent kinase (A-kinase). A-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine and threonine\nresidues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. A-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target\nproteins in each kind of cell are different. Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to cAMP in different cells.\nFigure 9.12 This diagram shows the mechanism for the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP serves as a second messenger to activate or\ninactivate proteins within the cell. Termination of the signal occurs when an enzyme called phosphodiesterase converts cAMP into AMP.\n9.2 \u2022 Propagation of the Signal\n239\nPresent in small concentrations in the plasma membrane, inositol phospholipids are lipids that can also be converted into\nsecond messengers. Because these molecules are membrane components, they are located near membrane-bound receptors and\ncan easily interact with them. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is the main phospholipid that plays a role in cellular signaling. Enzymes\nknown as kinases phosphorylate PI to form PI-phosphate (PIP) and PI-bisphosphate (PIP2).\nThe enzyme phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 to form diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) (Figure 9.13). These\nproducts of the cleavage of PIP2 serve as second messengers. Diacylglycerol (DAG) remains in the plasma membrane and\nactivates protein kinase C (PKC), which then phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in its target proteins. IP3 diffuses\ninto the cytoplasm and binds to ligand-gated calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ that continues the\nsignal cascade.\nFigure 9.13 The enzyme phospholipase C breaks down PIP2 into IP3 and DAG, both of which serve as second messengers.\n9.3 Response to the Signal\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe how signaling pathways direct protein expression, cellular metabolism, and cell growth\n\u2022\nIdentify the function of PKC in signal transduction pathways\n\u2022\nRecognize the role of apoptosis in the development and maintenance of a healthy organism\nInside the cell, ligands bind to their internal receptors, allowing them to directly affect the cell\u2019s DNA and protein-producing\nmachinery. Using signal transduction pathways, receptors in the plasma membrane produce a variety of effects on the cell. The\nresults of signaling pathways are extremely varied and depend on the type of cell involved as well as the external and internal\nconditions. A small sampling of responses is described below.\nGene Expression\nSome signal transduction pathways regulate the transcription of RNA. Others regulate the translation of proteins from mRNA.\nAn example of a protein that regulates translation in the nucleus is the MAP kinase ERK. The MAPK/ERK pathway (also known\nas the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) is a chain of proteins in the cell that communicates a signal from a receptor on the surface of\nthe cell to the nuclear DNA. ERK is activated in a phosphorylation cascade when epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds the EGF\nreceptor (see Figure 9.10). Upon phosphorylation, ERK enters the nucleus and activates a protein kinase that, in turn, regulates\nprotein translation (Figure 9.14).\n240\nChapter 9 \u2022 Cell Communication\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 9.14 ERK is a MAP kinase that activates translation when it is phosphorylated. ERK phosphorylates MNK1, which in turn\nphosphorylates eIF-4E, an elongation initiation factor that, with other initiation factors, is associated with mRNA. When eIF-4E becomes\nphosphorylated, the mRNA unfolds, allowing protein synthesis in the nucleus to begin. (See Figure 9.10 for the phosphorylation pathway\nthat activates ERK.)\nAnother mechanism of gene regulation involves PKC, which can interact with is a protein that acts as an inhibitor. An inhibitor\nis a molecule that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function. In this case, the inhibitor is a\nprotein called I\u03ba-B, which binds to the regulatory protein NF-\u03baB. (The symbol \u03ba represents the Greek letter kappa.) When I\u03ba-B\nis bound to NF-\u03baB, the complex cannot enter the nucleus of the cell, but when I\u03ba-B is phosphorylated by PKC, it can no longer\nbind NF-\u03baB, and NF-\u03baB (a transcription factor) can enter the nucleus and initiate RNA transcription. In this case, the effect of\nphosphorylation is to inactivate an inhibitor and thereby activate the process of transcription.\nIncrease in Cellular Metabolism\nThe result of another signaling pathway affects muscle cells. The activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in muscle cells by\nadrenaline leads to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) inside the cell. Also known as epinephrine, adrenaline is a hormone\n(produced by the adrenal gland located on top of the kidney) that readies the body for short-term emergencies. Cyclic AMP\nactivates PKA (protein kinase A), which in turn phosphorylates two enzymes. The first enzyme promotes the degradation of\nglycogen by activating intermediate glycogen phosphorylase kinase (GPK) that in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase (GP)\nthat catabolizes glycogen into its constituent glucose monomers. (Recall that your body converts excess glucose to glycogen for\nshort-term storage. When energy is needed, glycogen is quickly reconverted to glucose.) Phosphorylation of the second enzyme,\nglycogen synthase (GS), inhibits its ability to form glycogen from glucose. In this manner, a muscle cell obtains a ready pool of\nglucose by activating its formation via glycogen degradation and by inhibiting the use of glucose to form glycogen, thus\npreventing a futile cycle of glycogen degradation and synthesis. The glucose is then available for use by the muscle cell in\nresponse to a sudden surge of adrenaline\u2014the \u201cfight or flight\u201d reflex.\nCell Growth\nCell signaling pathways also play a major role in cell division. Cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals\nfrom other cells. The ligands that promote cell growth are called growth factors. Most growth factors bind to cell-surface\nreceptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases. These cell-surface receptors are called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Activation\nof RTKs initiates a signaling pathway that includes a G-protein called RAS, which activates the MAP kinase pathway described\n9.3 \u2022 Response to the Signal\n241\nearlier. The enzyme MAP kinase then stimulates the expression of proteins that interact with other cellular components to\ninitiate cell division.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nCancer Biologist\nCancer biologists study the molecular origins of cancer with the goal of developing new prevention methods and treatment\nstrategies that will inhibit the growth of tumors without harming the normal cells of the body. As mentioned earlier, signaling\npathways control cell growth. These signaling pathways are controlled by signaling proteins, which are, in turn, expressed by\ngenes. Mutations in these genes can result in malfunctioning signaling proteins. This prevents the cell from regulating its cell\ncycle, triggering unrestricted cell division and perhaps cancer. The genes that regulate the signaling proteins are one type of\noncogene, which is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. The gene encoding RAS is an oncogene that was originally\ndiscovered when mutations in the RAS protein were linked to cancer. Further studies have indicated that 30 percent of cancer\ncells have a mutation in the RAS gene that leads to uncontrolled growth. If left unchecked, uncontrolled cell division can lead to\ntumor formation and metastasis, the growth of cancer cells in new locations in the body.\nCancer biologists have been able to identify many other oncogenes that contribute to the development of cancer. For example,\nHER2 is a cell-surface receptor that is present in excessive amounts in 20 percent of human breast cancers. Cancer biologists\nrealized that gene duplication led to HER2 overexpression in 25 percent of breast cancer patients and developed a drug called\nHerceptin (trastuzumab). Herceptin is a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2 for removal by the immune system. Herceptin\ntherapy helps to control signaling through HER2. The use of Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy has helped to\nincrease the overall survival rate of patients with metastatic breast cancer.\nMore information on cancer biology research can be found at the National Cancer Institute website (https://www.cancer.gov/\nresearch/areas/biology (http://openstax.org/l/cancer_research) ).\nCell Death\nWhen a cell is damaged, superfluous, or potentially dangerous to an organism, a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger\nprogrammed cell death, or apoptosis. Apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents the release of\npotentially damaging molecules from inside the cell. There are many internal checkpoints that monitor a cell\u2019s health; if\nabnormalities are observed, a cell can spontaneously initiate the process of apoptosis. However, in some cases, such as a viral\ninfection or uncontrolled cell division due to cancer, the cell\u2019s normal checks and balances fail. External signaling can also\ninitiate apoptosis. For example, most normal animal cells have receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix, a network of\nglycoproteins that provides structural support for cells in an organism. The binding of cellular receptors to the extracellular\nmatrix initiates a signaling cascade within the cell. However, if the cell moves away from the extracellular matrix, the signaling\nceases, and the cell undergoes apoptosis. This system keeps cells from traveling through the body and proliferating out of\ncontrol, as happens with tumor cells that metastasize.\nAnother example of external signaling that leads to apoptosis occurs in T-cell development. T-cells are immune cells that bind to\nforeign macromolecules and particles, and target them for destruction by the immune system. Normally, T-cells do not target\n\u201cself\u201d proteins (those of their own organism), a process that can lead to autoimmune diseases. In order to develop the ability to\ndiscriminate between self and non-self, immature T-cells undergo screening to determine whether they bind to so-called self\nproteins. If the T-cell receptor binds to self proteins, the cell initiates apoptosis to remove the potentially dangerous cell.\nApoptosis is also essential for normal embryological development. In vertebrates, for example, early stages of development\ninclude the formation of web-like tissue between individual fingers and toes (Figure 9.15). During the course of normal\ndevelopment, these unneeded cells must be eliminated, enabling fully separated fingers and toes to form. A cell signaling\nmechanism triggers apoptosis, which destroys the cells between the developing digits.\n242\nChapter 9 \u2022 Cell Communication\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 9.15 The histological section of a foot of a 15-day-old mouse embryo, visualized using light microscopy, reveals areas of tissue\nbetween the toes, which apoptosis will eliminate before the mouse reaches its full gestational age at 27 days. (credit: modification of work\nby Michal Ma\u00f1as)\nTermination of the Signal Cascade\nThe aberrant signaling often seen in tumor cells is proof that the termination of a signal at the appropriate time can be just as\nimportant as the initiation of a signal. One method of stopping a specific signal is to degrade the ligand or remove it so that it\ncan no longer access its receptor. One reason that hydrophobic hormones like estrogen and testosterone trigger long-lasting\nevents is because they bind carrier proteins. These proteins allow the insoluble molecules to be soluble in blood, but they also\nprotect the hormones from degradation by circulating enzymes.\nInside the cell, many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications that result from signaling cascades. For example,\nphosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called\ndephosphorylation. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is degraded into AMP by phosphodiesterase, and the release of calcium stores is\nreversed by the Ca2+ pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell.\n9.4 Signaling in Single-Celled Organisms\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe how single-celled yeasts use cell signaling to communicate with one another\n\u2022\nRelate the role of quorum sensing to the ability of some bacteria to form biofilms\nWithin-cell signaling allows bacteria to respond to environmental cues, such as nutrient levels. Some single-celled organisms\nalso release molecules to signal to each other.\nSignaling in Yeast\nYeasts are eukaryotes (fungi), and the components and processes found in yeast signals are similar to those of cell-surface\nreceptor signals in multicellular organisms. Budding yeasts (Figure 9.16) are able to participate in a process that is similar to\nsexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells (cells with one-half the normal number of chromosomes) combining to form a\ndiploid cell (a cell with two sets of each chromosome, which is what normal body cells contain). In order to find another haploid\nyeast cell that is prepared to mate, budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor. When mating factor binds\nto cell-surface receptors in other yeast cells that are nearby, they stop their normal growth cycles and initiate a cell signaling\ncascade that includes protein kinases and GTP-binding proteins that are similar to G-proteins.\n9.4 \u2022 Signaling in Single-Celled Organisms\n243\nFigure 9.16 Budding Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells can communicate by releasing a signaling molecule called mating factor.

There are circumstances, however, when bacteria communicate with each\nother.\nThe first evidence of bacterial communication was observed in a bacterium that has a symbiotic relationship with Hawaiian\nbobtail squid. When the population density of the bacteria reaches a certain level, specific gene expression is initiated, and the\nbacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light. Because the number of cells present in the environment (cell density)\nis the determining factor for signaling, bacterial signaling was named quorum sensing. In politics and business, a quorum is\nthe minimum number of members required to be present to vote on an issue.\nQuorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules. Autoinducers are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to\ncommunicate with other bacteria of the same kind. The secreted autoinducers can be small, hydrophobic molecules, such as\nacyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), or larger peptide-based molecules; each type of molecule has a different mode of action. When\nAHL enters target bacteria, it binds to transcription factors, which then switch gene expression on or off. When the number of\nbacteria increases so does the concentration of the autoinducer, triggering increased expression of certain genes including\nautoinducers, which results in a self-amplifying cycle, also known as a positive feedback loop (Figure 9.17). The peptide\nautoinducers stimulate more complicated signaling pathways that include bacterial kinases. The changes in bacteria following\nexposure to autoinducers can be quite extensive. The pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has 616 different genes\nthat respond to autoinducers.\nSome species of bacteria that use quorum sensing form biofilms, complex colonies of bacteria (often containing several species)\nthat exchange chemical signals to coordinate the release of toxins that will attack the host. Bacterial biofilms (Figure 9.18) can\nsometimes be found on medical equipment; when biofilms invade implants such as hip or knee replacements or heart\npacemakers, they can cause life-threatening infections.\n244\nChapter 9 \u2022 Cell Communication\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 9.17 Autoinducers are small molecules or proteins produced by bacteria that regulate gene expression.\nWhich of the following statements about quorum sensing is false?\na.\nAutoinducer must bind to receptor to turn on transcription of genes responsible for the production of more autoinducer.\nb.\nThe receptor stays in the bacterial cell, but the autoinducer diffuses out.\nc.\nAutoinducer can only act on a different cell: it cannot act on the cell in which it is made.\nd.\nAutoinducer turns on genes that enable the bacteria to form a biofilm.\n9.4 \u2022 Signaling in Single-Celled Organisms\n245\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 9.18 Cell-cell communication enables these (a) Staphylococcus aureus bacteria to work together to form a biofilm inside a hospital\npatient\u2019s catheter, seen here via scanning electron microscopy.

The luminescence makes it difficult to see the\nsquid from below because it effectively eliminates its shadow. In return for camouflage, the squid provides food for the bacteria. Free-living\nV. fischeri do not produce luciferase, the enzyme responsible for luminescence, but V. fischeri living in a symbiotic relationship with the\nsquid do. Quorum sensing determines whether the bacteria should produce the luciferase enzyme.

Recent discoveries\nsuggest that it may be possible to exploit bacterial signaling pathways to control bacterial growth; this process could replace or\nsupplement antibiotics that are no longer effective in certain situations.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch geneticist Bonnie Bassler discuss her discovery (http://openstax.org/l/bacteria_talk) of quorum sensing in biofilm\nbacteria in squid.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nCellular Communication in Yeasts\nThe first cellular form of life on our planet likely consisted of single-celled prokaryotic organisms that had limited interaction\nwith each other. While some external signaling occurs between different species of single-celled organisms, the majority of\nsignaling within bacteria and yeasts concerns only other members of the same species. The evolution of cellular communication\nis an absolute necessity for the development of multicellular organisms, and this innovation is thought to have required\napproximately 2 billion years to appear in early life forms.\nYeasts are single-celled eukaryotes and, therefore, have a nucleus and organelles characteristic of more complex life forms.\nComparisons of the genomes of yeasts, nematode worms, fruit flies, and humans illustrate the evolution of increasingly\ncomplex signaling systems that allow for the efficient inner workings that keep humans and other complex life forms\nfunctioning correctly.\nKinases are a major component of cellular communication, and studies of these enzymes illustrate the evolutionary connectivity\nof different species. Yeasts have 130 types of kinases. More complex organisms such as nematode worms and fruit flies have 454\nand 239 kinases, respectively. Of the 130 kinase types in yeast, 97 belong to the 55 subfamilies of kinases that are found in other\n246\nChapter 9 \u2022 Cell Communication\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\neukaryotic organisms. The only obvious deficiency seen in yeasts is the complete absence of tyrosine kinases. It is hypothesized\nthat phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is needed to control the more sophisticated functions of development, differentiation,\nand cellular communication used in multicellular organisms.\nBecause yeasts contain many of the same classes of signaling proteins as humans, these organisms are ideal for studying\nsignaling cascades. Yeasts multiply quickly and are much simpler organisms than humans or other multicellular animals.\nTherefore, the signaling cascades are also simpler and easier to study, although they contain similar counterparts to human\nsignaling.2\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this collection of interview clips with biofilm researchers in \u201cWhat Are Bacterial Biofilms?\u201d\nClick to view content (https://openstax.org/l/bacteria_biofilm)\n2G.

The four\ncategories of signaling in multicellular organisms are\nparacrine signaling, endocrine signaling, autocrine\nsignaling, and direct signaling across gap junctions.\nParacrine signaling takes place over short distances.\nEndocrine signals are carried long distances through the\nbloodstream by hormones, and autocrine signals are\nreceived by the same cell that sent the signal or other nearby\ncells of the same kind. Gap junctions allow small molecules,\nincluding signaling molecules, to flow between neighboring\ncells.\nInternal receptors are found in the cell cytoplasm. Here, they\nbind ligand molecules that cross the plasma membrane;\nthese receptor-ligand complexes move to the nucleus and\ninteract directly with cellular DNA. Cell-surface receptors\ntransmit a signal from outside the cell to the cytoplasm. Ion\nchannel-linked receptors, when bound to their ligands, form\na pore through the plasma membrane through which certain\nions can pass. G-protein-linked receptors interact with a G-\nprotein on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane,\npromoting the exchange of bound GDP for GTP and\ninteracting with other enzymes or ion channels to transmit a\nsignal. Enzyme-linked receptors transmit a signal from\noutside the cell to an intracellular domain of a membrane-\nbound enzyme. Ligand binding causes activation of the\nenzyme. Small hydrophobic ligands (like steroids) are able to\npenetrate the plasma membrane and bind to internal\nreceptors. Water-soluble hydrophilic ligands are unable to\npass through the membrane; instead, they bind to cell-\nsurface receptors, which transmit the signal to the inside of\nthe cell.\n9.2 Propagation of the Signal\nLigand binding to the receptor allows for signal transduction\nthrough the cell. The chain of events that conveys the signal\nthrough the cell is called a signaling pathway or cascade.\nSignaling pathways are often very complex because of the\ninterplay between different proteins. A major component of\ncell signaling cascades is the phosphorylation of molecules\nby enzymes known as kinases. Phosphorylation adds a\nphosphate group to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues\nin a protein, changing their shapes, and activating or\ninactivating the protein. Small molecules like nucleotides\ncan also be phosphorylated. Second messengers are small,\nnon-protein molecules that are used to transmit a signal\nwithin a cell. Some examples of second messengers are\ncalcium ions (Ca2+), cyclic AMP (cAMP), diacylglycerol (DAG),\nand inositol triphosphate (IP3).\n9.3 Response to the Signal\nThe initiation of a signaling pathway is a response to external\nstimuli. This response can take many different forms,\nincluding protein synthesis, a change in the cell\u2019s\nmetabolism, cell growth, or even cell death. Many pathways\ninfluence the cell by initiating gene expression, and the\nmethods utilized are quite numerous. Some pathways\nactivate enzymes that interact with DNA transcription\nfactors. Others modify proteins and induce them to change\ntheir location in the cell. Depending on the status of the\norganism, cells can respond by storing energy as glycogen or\nfat, or making it available in the form of glucose. A signal\ntransduction pathway allows muscle cells to respond to\nimmediate requirements for energy in the form of glucose.\nCell growth is almost always stimulated by external signals\ncalled growth factors. Uncontrolled cell growth leads to\ncancer, and mutations in the genes encoding protein\ncomponents of signaling pathways are often found in tumor\ncells. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is important for\nremoving damaged or unnecessary cells. The use of cellular\nsignaling to organize the dismantling of a cell ensures that\nharmful molecules from the cytoplasm are not released into\nthe spaces between cells, as they are in uncontrolled death,\nnecrosis. Apoptosis also ensures the efficient recycling of the\ncomponents of the dead cell. Termination of the cellular\nsignaling cascade is very important so that the response to a\nsignal is appropriate in both timing and intensity.\nDegradation of signaling molecules and dephosphorylation\nof phosphorylated intermediates of the pathway by\nphosphatases are two ways to terminate signals within the\ncell.\n9.4 Signaling in Single-Celled\nOrganisms\nYeasts and multicellular organisms have similar signaling\nmechanisms. Yeasts use cell-surface receptors and signaling\ncascades to communicate information on mating with other\nyeast cells. The signaling molecule secreted by yeasts is called\nmating factor.\nBacterial signaling is called quorum sensing. Bacteria\nsecrete signaling molecules called autoinducers that are\neither small, hydrophobic molecules or peptide-based\nsignals. The hydrophobic autoinducers, such as AHL, bind\ntranscription factors and directly affect gene expression. The\npeptide-based molecules bind kinases and initiate signaling\ncascades in the cells.\nChapter 9 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n249\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

In our species, billions of cell divisions subsequently must occur in a controlled\nmanner in order to produce a complex, multicellular human comprising trillions of cells. Thus, the\noriginal single-celled zygote is literally the ancestor of all cells in the body. However, once a human is\nfully grown, cell reproduction is still necessary to repair and regenerate tissues, and sometimes to\nincrease our size! In fact, all multicellular organisms use cell division for growth and the maintenance\nand repair of cells and tissues. Cell division is closely regulated, and the occasional failure of this\nregulation can have life-threatening consequences. Single-celled organisms may also use cell division as\ntheir method of reproduction.\nChapter Outline\n10.1 Cell Division\n10.2 The Cell Cycle\n10.3 Control of the Cell\nCycle\n10.4 Cancer and the Cell\nCycle\n10.5 Prokaryotic Cell\nDivision\nthe structure and function of a cell\u2019s genetic information is necessary. A cell\u2019s DNA, packaged as a double-\nstranded DNA molecule, is called its genome. In prokaryotes, the genome is composed of a single, double-\nstranded DNA molecule in the form of a loop or circle (Figure 10.2). The region in the cell containing this\ngenetic material is called a nucleoid. Some prokaryotes also have smaller loops of DNA called plasmids that\nare not essential for normal growth. Bacteria can exchange these plasmids with other bacteria, sometimes\nreceiving beneficial new genes that the recipient can add to their chromosomal DNA. Antibiotic resistance is\none trait that often spreads through a bacterial colony through plasmid exchange from resistant donors to\nrecipient cells.\nFigure 10.2 Prokaryotes, including both Bacteria and Archaea, have a single, circular chromosome located in a central\nregion called the nucleoid.\nIn eukaryotes, the genome consists of several double-stranded linear DNA molecules (Figure 10.3). Each\nspecies of eukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells. Human body\n(somatic) cells have 46 chromosomes, while human gametes (sperm or eggs) have 23 chromosomes each. A\ntypical body cell contains two matched or homologous sets of chromosomes (one set from each biological\nparent)\u2014a configuration known as diploid. (Note: The letter n is used to represent a single set of\nchromosomes; therefore, a diploid organism is designated 2n.) Human cells that contain one set of\nchromosomes are called gametes, or sex cells; these are eggs and sperm, and are designated 1n, or haploid.\nUpon fertilization, each gamete contributes one set of chromosomes, creating a diploid cell containing\nmatched pairs of chromosomes called homologous (\u201csame knowledge\u201d) chromosomes. Homologous\nchromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same\nlocation, or locus. Genes, the functional units of chromosomes, determine specific characteristics by coding\nfor specific proteins. Traits are the variations of those characteristics. For example, hair color is a\ncharacteristic with traits that are blonde, brown, or black, and many colors in between.\n254\nChapter 10 \u2022 Cell Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 10.3 There are 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes in a female human somatic cell. The condensed chromosomes are viewed\nwithin the nucleus (top), removed from a cell during mitosis (also called karyokinesis or nuclear division) and spread out on a slide (right),\nand artificially arranged according to length (left); an arrangement like this is called a karyotype. In this image, the chromosomes were\nexposed to fluorescent stains for differentiation of the different chromosomes. A method of staining called \u201cchromosome painting\u201d\nemploys fluorescent dyes that highlight chromosomes in different colors. (credit: National Human Genome Project/NIH)\nEach copy of a homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a different parent; therefore, the different genes (alleles)\nthemselves are not identical, although they code for the same traits such as \u201chair color.\u201d The variation of individuals within a\nspecies is due to the specific combination of the genes inherited from both parents. Even a slightly altered sequence of\nnucleotides within a gene can result in an alternative trait. For example, there are three possible gene sequences on the human\nchromosome that code for blood type: sequence A, sequence B, and sequence O. Because all diploid human cells have two copies\nof the chromosome that determines blood type, the blood type (the trait) is determined by the two alleles of the marker gene that\nare inherited. It is possible to have two copies of the same gene sequence on both homologous chromosomes, with one on each\n(for example, AA, BB, or OO), or two different sequences, such as AB, AO, or BO.\nApparently minor variations of traits, such as blood type, eye color, and handedness, contribute to the natural variation found\nwithin a species, but even though they seem minor, these traits may be connected with the expression of other traits as of yet\nunknown. However, if the entire DNA sequence from any pair of human homologous chromosomes is compared, the difference\nis much less than one percent. The sex chromosomes, X and Y, are the single exception to the rule of homologous chromosome\nuniformity: Other than a small amount of homology that is necessary to accurately produce gametes, the genes found on the X\nand Y chromosomes are different.\nEukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction\nIf the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus were laid out end-to-end, it would measure approximately two\nmeters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm! Considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 \u00b5m (100,000 cells\nlined up to equal one meter), DNA must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell\u2019s nucleus. At the same time, it must also be readily\naccessible for the genes to be expressed. For this reason, the long strands of DNA are condensed into compact chromosomes\nduring certain stages of the cell cycle. There are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted.\nIn the first level of compaction, short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular\nintervals along the entire length of the chromosome (Figure 10.4). The DNA-histone complex is called chromatin. The beadlike,\nhistone DNA complex is called a nucleosome, and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called linker DNA. A DNA molecule in\nthis form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in\ncontrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix.\nThe second level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them coil into a 30-nm chromatin fiber.\nThis coiling further condenses the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form.\nIn the third level of compaction, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to \u201cpack the chromatin.\u201d These fibrous proteins also ensure\nthat each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any\n10.1 \u2022 Cell Division\n255\nother chromosome (see the top image in Figure 10.3).\nFigure 10.4 Double-stranded DNA wraps around histone proteins to form nucleosomes that create the appearance of \u201cbeads on a string.\u201d\nThe nucleosomes are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. When a cell undergoes mitosis, the chromosomes condense even further.\nDNA replicates in the S phase of interphase, which technically is not a part of mitosis, but must always precede it. After\nreplication, the chromosomes are composed of two linked sister chromatids. When fully compact, the pairs of identically\npacked chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins. The connection between the sister chromatids is closest in a\nregion called the centromere. The conjoined sister chromatids, with a diameter of about 1 \u00b5m, are visible under a light\nmicroscope. The centromeric region is highly condensed and thus will appear as a constricted area.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis animation illustrates the different levels of chromosome packing.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/Packaged_DNA)\n10.2 The Cell Cycle\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the three stages of interphase\n\u2022\nDiscuss the behavior of chromosomes during karyokinesis/mitosis\n\u2022\nExplain how the cytoplasmic content is divided during cytokinesis\n\u2022\nDefine the quiescent G0 phase\n256\nChapter 10 \u2022 Cell Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe cell cycle is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells. Cells on\nthe path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, DNA replication,\nand nuclear and cytoplasmic division that ultimately produces two identical (clone) cells. The cell cycle has two major phases:\ninterphase and the mitotic phase (Figure 10.5). During interphase, the cell grows and DNA is replicated. During the mitotic\nphase, the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell cytoplasm is typically partitioned by a third\nprocess of the cell cycle called cytokinesis. We should note, however, that interphase and mitosis (karyokinesis) may take place\nwithout cytokinesis, in which case cells with multiple nuclei (multinucleate cells) are produced.\nFigure 10.5 The cell cycle in multicellular organisms consists of interphase and the mitotic phase. During interphase, the cell grows and the\nnuclear DNA is duplicated. Interphase is followed by the mitotic phase. During the mitotic phase, the duplicated chromosomes are\nsegregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. Following mitosis, the cytoplasm is usually divided as well by cytokinesis, resulting in two\ngenetically identical daughter cells.\nInterphase\nDuring interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for cell division. In order for a cell to move\nfrom interphase into the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of interphase are\ncalled G1, S, and G2.\nG1 Phase (First Gap)\nThe first stage of interphase is called the G1 phase (first gap) because, from a microscopic point of view, little change is visible.\nHowever, during the G1 stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks of\nchromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as accumulating sufficient energy reserves to complete the task of\nreplicating each chromosome in the nucleus.\nS Phase (Synthesis of DNA)\nThroughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In the S phase, DNA replication\ncan proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules\u2014sister chromatids\u2014that\nare firmly attached to the centromeric region. The centrosome is also duplicated during the S phase. The two centrosomes of\nhomologous chromosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes\nduring mitosis. For example, roughly at the center of each animal cell, the centrosomes are associated with a pair of rod-like\nobjects, the centrioles, which are positioned at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. We should note,\n10.2 \u2022 The Cell Cycle\n257\nhowever, that centrioles are not present in the centrosomes of other eukaryotic organisms, such as plants and most fungi.\nG2 Phase (Second Gap)\nIn the G2 phase, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation and\nmovement. Some cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic phase.\nThere may be additional cell growth during G2. The final preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is\nable to enter the first stage of mitosis.\nThe Mitotic Phase\nThe mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and move into two\nnew, identical daughter cells. The first portion of the mitotic phase is called karyokinesis, or nuclear division. As we have just\nseen, the second portion of the mitotic phase (and often viewed as a process separate from and following mitosis) is called\ncytokinesis\u2014the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into the two daughter cells.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nRevisit the stages of mitosis at this site (http://openstax.org/l/Cell_cycle_mito) .\nKaryokinesis (Mitosis)\nKaryokinesis, also known as mitosis, is divided into a series of phases\u2014prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and\ntelophase\u2014that result in the division of the cell nucleus (Figure 10.6).\n258\nChapter 10 \u2022 Cell Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 10.6 Karyokinesis (or mitosis) is divided into five stages\u2014prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.

Sister chromatids line up at the metaphase plate. Cohesin\nproteins break down and the sister chromatids separate. The nucleus reforms and the cell divides.\nProphase (the \u201cfirst phase\u201d): the nuclear envelope starts to dissociate into small vesicles, and the membranous organelles (such\nas the Golgi complex [Golgi apparatus] and the endoplasmic reticulum), fragment and disperse toward the periphery of the cell.\nThe nucleolus disappears (disperses) as well, and the centrosomes begin to move to opposite poles of the cell. Microtubules that\n10.2 \u2022 The Cell Cycle\n259\nwill form the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes, pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen.\nThe sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly with the aid of condensin proteins and now become visible under a light\nmicroscope.\nPrometaphase (the \u201cfirst change phase\u201d): Many processes that began in prophase continue to advance. The remnants of the\nnuclear envelope fragment further, and the mitotic spindle continues to develop as more microtubules assemble and stretch\nacross the length of the former nuclear area. Chromosomes become even more condensed and discrete. Each sister chromatid\ndevelops a protein structure called a kinetochore in its centromeric region (Figure 10.7). The proteins of the kinetochore attract\nand bind to the mitotic spindle microtubules. As the spindle microtubules extend from the centrosomes, some of these\nmicrotubules come into contact with and firmly bind to the kinetochores. Once a mitotic fiber attaches to a chromosome, the\nchromosome will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids face the opposite poles. Eventually, all the sister\nchromatids will be attached via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles. Spindle microtubules that do not\nengage the chromosomes are called polar microtubules. These microtubules overlap each other midway between the two poles\nand contribute to cell elongation. Astral microtubules are located near the poles, aid in spindle orientation, and are required for\nthe regulation of mitosis.\nFigure 10.7 During prometaphase, mitotic spindle microtubules from opposite poles attach to each sister chromatid at the kinetochore. In\nanaphase, the connection between the sister chromatids breaks down, and the microtubules pull the chromosomes toward opposite poles.\nMetaphase (the \u201cchange phase\u201d): All the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the metaphase plate, or the equatorial plane,\nroughly midway between the two poles of the cell. The sister chromatids are still tightly attached to each other by cohesin\nproteins. At this time, the chromosomes are maximally condensed.\nAnaphase (\u201cupward phase\u201d): The cohesin proteins degrade, and the sister chromatids separate at the centromere. Each\nchromatid, now called a single chromosome, is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule is attached. The\ncell becomes visibly elongated (oval shaped) as the polar microtubules slide against each other at the metaphase plate where they\noverlap.\nTelophase (the \u201cdistance phase\u201d): the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense (unravel), relaxing once\nagain into a stretched-out chromatin configuration. The mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be\nused to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter cell. Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes, and\nnucleosomes appear within the nuclear area.\nCytokinesis\nCytokinesis, or \u201ccell motion,\u201d is sometimes viewed as the second main stage of the mitotic phase, during which cell division is\ncompleted via the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells However, as we have seen earlier,\ncytokinesis can also be viewed as a separate phase, which may or may not take place following mitosis. If cytokinesis does take\nplace, cell division is not complete until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two\ndaughter cells. Although the stages of mitosis are similar for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for\neukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plant cells.\nIn animal cells, cytokinesis typically starts during late anaphase. A contractile ring composed of actin filaments forms just inside\n260\nChapter 10 \u2022 Cell Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthe plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate. The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure.\nThis fissure is called the cleavage furrow. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane is\ncleaved in two (Figure 10.8).\nIn plant cells, a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates\nenzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing cell.\nDuring telophase, these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast (a vesicular structure) at the\nmetaphase plate. There, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called a cell plate. As\nmore vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell. Enzymes use the glucose\nthat has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall. The Golgi membranes become parts of the plasma\nmembrane on either side of the new cell wall (Figure 10.8).\nFigure 10.8 During cytokinesis in animal cells, a ring of actin filaments forms at the metaphase plate. The ring contracts, forming a cleavage\nfurrow, which divides the cell in two. In plant cells, Golgi vesicles coalesce at the former metaphase plate, forming a phragmoplast. A cell\nplate formed by the fusion of the vesicles of the phragmoplast grows from the center toward the cell walls, and the membranes of the\nvesicles fuse to form a plasma membrane that divides the cell in two.\nG0 Phase\nNot all cells adhere to the classic cell-cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the preparatory\nphases of interphase, closely followed by the mitotic phase, and cytokinesis. Cells in G0 phase are not actively preparing to\ndivide. The cell is in a quiescent (inactive) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle. Some cells enter G0 temporarily due to\nenvironmental conditions such as availability of nutrients, or stimulation by growth factors. The cell will remain in this phase\nuntil conditions improve or until an external signal triggers the onset of G1. Other cells that never or rarely divide, such as\nmature cardiac muscle and nerve cells, remain in G0 permanently.\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION\nDetermine the Time Spent in Cell-Cycle Stages\nProblem: How long does a cell spend in interphase compared to each stage of mitosis?\nBackground: A prepared microscope slide of whitefish blastula cross-sections will show cells arrested in various stages of the\ncell cycle. (Note: It is not visually possible to separate the stages of interphase from each other, but the mitotic stages are readily\nidentifiable.) If 100 cells are examined, the number of cells in each identifiable cell-cycle stage will give an estimate of the time it\ntakes for the cell to complete that stage.\n10.2 \u2022 The Cell Cycle\n261\nProblem Statement: Given the events included in all of interphase and those that take place in each stage of mitosis, estimate\nthe length of each stage based on a 24-hour cell cycle. Before proceeding, state your hypothesis.\nTest your hypothesis: Test your hypothesis by doing the following:\n1.\nPlace a fixed and stained microscope slide of whitefish blastula cross-sections under the scanning objective of a light\nmicroscope.\n2.\nLocate and focus on one of the sections using the low-power objective of your microscope. Notice that the section is a circle\ncomposed of dozens of closely packed individual cells.\n3.\nSwitch to the medium-power objective and refocus. With this objective, individual cells are clearly visible, but the\nchromosomes will still be very small.\n4.\nSwitch to the high-power objective and slowly move the slide left to right, and up and down to view all the cells in the\nsection (Figure 10.9). As you scan, you will notice that most of the cells are not undergoing mitosis but are in the interphase\nperiod of the cell cycle.\nFigure 10.9 Slowly scan whitefish blastula cells with the high-power objective as illustrated in image (a) to identify their mitotic stage.\n(b) A microscopic image of the scanned cells is shown.

In humans, the frequency of cell turnover\nranges from a few hours in early embryonic development, to an average of two to five days for epithelial cells, and to an entire\nhuman lifetime spent in G0 by specialized cells, such as cortical neurons or cardiac muscle cells.\nThere is also variation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle. When rapidly dividing mammalian cells are\ngrown in a culture (outside the body under optimal growing conditions), the length of the cell cycle is about 24 hours. In rapidly\ndividing human cells with a 24-hour cell cycle, the G1 phase lasts approximately nine hours, the S phase lasts 10 hours, the G2\n10.3 \u2022 Control of the Cell Cycle\n263\nphase lasts about four and one-half hours, and the M phase lasts approximately one-half hour. By comparison, in fertilized eggs\n(and early embryos) of fruit flies, the cell cycle is completed in about eight minutes. This is because the nucleus of the fertilized\negg divides many times by mitosis but does not go through cytokinesis until a multinucleate \u201czygote\u201d has been produced, with\nmany nuclei located along the periphery of the cell membrane, thereby shortening the time of the cell division cycle. The timing\nof events in the cell cycle of both \u201cinvertebrates\u201d and \u201cvertebrates\u201d is controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and\nexternal to the cell.\nRegulation of the Cell Cycle by External Events\nBoth the initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events external to the cell when it is about to begin the\nreplication process. An event may be as simple as the death of nearby cells or as sweeping as the release of growth-promoting\nhormones, such as human growth hormone (HGH or hGH). A lack of HGH can inhibit cell division, resulting in dwarfism,\nwhereas too much HGH can result in gigantism. Crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division. In contrast, a factor that can\ninitiate cell division is the size of the cell: As a cell grows, it becomes physiologically inefficient due to its decreasing surface-to-\nvolume ratio. The solution to this problem is to divide.\nWhatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed into\ninterphase. Moving forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell cycle phase must be met or the\ncycle cannot progress.\nRegulation at Internal Checkpoints\nIt is essential that the daughter cells produced be exact duplicates of the parent cell. Mistakes in the duplication or distribution\nof the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced from an abnormal cell. To prevent\na compromised cell from continuing to divide, there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three main cell-cycle\ncheckpoints: A checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of a cell to the next stage\nin the cycle can be halted until conditions are favorable. These checkpoints occur near the end of G1, at the G2/M transition, and\nduring metaphase (Figure 10.10).\nFigure 10.10 The cell cycle is controlled at three checkpoints. The integrity of the DNA is assessed at the G1 checkpoint. Proper\nchromosome duplication is assessed at the G2 checkpoint. Attachment of each kinetochore to a spindle fiber is assessed at the M\n264\nChapter 10 \u2022 Cell Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncheckpoint.\nThe G1 Checkpoint\nThe G1 checkpoint determines whether all conditions are favorable for cell division to proceed. The G1 checkpoint, also called the\nrestriction point (in yeast), is a point at which the cell irreversibly commits to the cell division process. External influences, such\nas growth factors, play a large role in carrying the cell past the G1 checkpoint. In addition to adequate reserves and cell size,\nthere is a check for genomic DNA damage at the G1 checkpoint. A cell that does not meet all the requirements will not be allowed\nto progress into the S phase. The cell can halt the cycle and attempt to remedy the problematic condition, or the cell can advance\ninto G0 and await further signals when conditions improve.\nThe G2 Checkpoint\nThe G2 checkpoint bars entry into the mitotic phase if certain conditions are not met. As at the G1 checkpoint, cell size and\nprotein reserves are assessed. However, the most important role of the G2 checkpoint is to ensure that all of the chromosomes\nhave been replicated and that the replicated DNA is not damaged. If the checkpoint mechanisms detect problems with the DNA,\nthe cell cycle is halted, and the cell attempts to either complete DNA replication or repair the damaged DNA.\nThe M Checkpoint\nThe M checkpoint occurs near the end of the metaphase stage of karyokinesis. The M checkpoint is also known as the spindle\ncheckpoint, because it determines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly attached to the spindle microtubules. Because\nthe separation of the sister chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step, the cycle will not proceed until the kinetochores\nof each pair of sister chromatids are firmly anchored to at least two spindle fibers arising from opposite poles of the cell.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch what occurs at the G1, G2, and M checkpoints by visiting this website (http://openstax.org/l/cell_checkpnts) to see an\nanimation of the cell cycle.\nRegulator Molecules of the Cell Cycle\nIn addition to the internally controlled checkpoints, there are two groups of intracellular molecules that regulate the cell cycle.\nThese regulatory molecules either promote progress of the cell to the next phase (positive regulation) or halt the cycle (negative\nregulation). Regulator molecules may act individually, or they can influence the activity or production of other regulatory\nproteins. Therefore, the failure of a single regulator may have almost no effect on the cell cycle, especially if more than one\nmechanism controls the same event. However, the effect of a deficient or non-functioning regulator can be wide-ranging and\npossibly fatal to the cell if multiple processes are affected.\nPositive Regulation of the Cell Cycle\nTwo groups of proteins, called cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), are termed positive regulators. They are responsible\nfor the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints. The levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell\ncycle in a predictable pattern (Figure 10.11). Increases in the concentration of cyclin proteins are triggered by both external and\ninternal signals. After the cell moves to the next stage of the cell cycle, the cyclins that were active in the previous stage are\ndegraded by cytoplasmic enzymes, as shown in Figure 10.11 below.\n10.3 \u2022 Control of the Cell Cycle\n265\nFigure 10.11 The concentrations of cyclin proteins change throughout the cell cycle. There is a direct correlation between cyclin\naccumulation and the three major cell-cycle checkpoints. Also note the sharp decline of cyclin levels following each checkpoint (the\ntransition between phases of the cell cycle), as cyclin is degraded by cytoplasmic enzymes. (credit: modification of work by\n\"WikiMiMa\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nCyclins regulate the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to Cdks. To be fully active, the Cdk/cyclin complex must also be\nphosphorylated in specific locations to activate the complex. Like all kinases, Cdks are enzymes (kinases) that in turn\nphosphorylate other proteins. Phosphorylation activates the protein by changing its shape. The proteins phosphorylated by Cdks\nare involved in advancing the cell to the next phase. (Figure 10.12). The levels of Cdk proteins are relatively stable throughout the\ncell cycle; however, the concentrations of cyclin fluctuate and determine when Cdk/cyclin complexes form. The different cyclins\nand Cdks bind at specific points in the cell cycle and thus regulate different checkpoints.\n266\nChapter 10 \u2022 Cell Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 10.12 Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are protein kinases that, when fully activated, can phosphorylate and thus activate other\nproteins that advance the cell cycle past a checkpoint. To become fully activated, a Cdk must bind to a cyclin protein and then be\nphosphorylated by another kinase.\nBecause the cyclic fluctuations of cyclin levels are largely based on the timing of the cell cycle and not on specific events,\nregulation of the cell cycle usually occurs by either the Cdk molecules alone or the Cdk/cyclin complexes. Without a specific\nconcentration of fully activated cyclin/Cdk complexes, the cell cycle cannot proceed through the checkpoints.\nAlthough the cyclins are the main regulatory molecules that determine the forward momentum of the cell cycle, there are several\nother mechanisms that fine-tune the progress of the cycle with negative, rather than positive, effects. These mechanisms\nessentially block the progression of the cell cycle until problematic conditions are resolved. Molecules that prevent the full\nactivation of Cdks are called Cdk inhibitors. Many of these inhibitor molecules directly or indirectly monitor a particular cell-\ncycle event. The block placed on Cdks by inhibitor molecules will not be removed until the specific event that the inhibitor\nmonitors is completed.\n10.3 \u2022 Control of the Cell Cycle\n267\nNegative Regulation of the Cell Cycle\nThe second group of cell-cycle regulatory molecules are negative regulators, which stop the cell cycle. Remember that in positive\nregulation, active molecules cause the cycle to progress.\nThe best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein (Rb), p53, and p21. Retinoblastoma proteins are\na group of tumor-suppressor proteins common in many cells. We should note here that the 53 and 21 designations refer to the\nfunctional molecular masses of the proteins (p) in kilodaltons (a dalton is equal to an atomic mass unit, which is equal to one\nproton or one neutron or 1 g/mol). Much of what is known about cell-cycle regulation comes from research conducted with cells\nthat have lost regulatory control. All three of these regulatory proteins were discovered to be damaged or non-functional in cells\nthat had begun to replicate uncontrollably (i.e., became cancerous). In each case, the main cause of the unchecked progress\nthrough the cell cycle was a faulty copy of the regulatory protein.\nRb, p53, and p21 act primarily at the G1 checkpoint. p53 is a multi-functional protein that has a major impact on the\ncommitment of a cell to division because it acts when there is damaged DNA in cells that are undergoing the preparatory\nprocesses during G1. If damaged DNA is detected, p53 halts the cell cycle and then recruits specific enzymes to repair the DNA.\nIf the DNA cannot be repaired, p53 can trigger apoptosis, or cell suicide, to prevent the duplication of damaged chromosomes.\nAs p53 levels rise, the production of p21 is triggered. p21 enforces the halt in the cycle dictated by p53 by binding to and\ninhibiting the activity of the Cdk/cyclin complexes. As a cell is exposed to more stress, higher levels of p53 and p21 accumulate,\nmaking it less likely that the cell will move into the S phase.\nRb, which largely monitors cell size, exerts its regulatory influence on other positive regulator proteins. In the active,\ndephosphorylated state, Rb binds to proteins called transcription factors, most commonly, E2F (Figure 10.13). Transcription\nfactors \u201cturn on\u201d specific genes, allowing the production of proteins encoded by that gene. When Rb is bound to E2F, production\nof proteins necessary for the G1/S transition is blocked. As the cell increases in size, Rb is slowly phosphorylated until it becomes\ninactivated.

Despite the redundancy\nand overlapping levels of cell-cycle control, errors do occur. One of the critical processes monitored by the cell-cycle checkpoint\nsurveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S phase. Even when all of the cell-cycle controls are fully\nfunctional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the daughter cells. If changes to the DNA\nnucleotide sequence occur within a coding portion of a gene and are not corrected, a gene mutation results. All cancers start\nwhen a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in cell reproduction.\nThe change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor: perhaps a slight delay in the binding of Cdk to\ncyclin or an Rb protein that detaches from its target DNA while still phosphorylated. Even minor mistakes, however, may allow\nsubsequent mistakes to occur more readily. Over and over, small uncorrected errors are passed from the parent cell to the\ndaughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more non-functional proteins from uncorrected DNA damage.\nEventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and repair mechanisms decreases. Uncontrolled\ngrowth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and a tumor (\u201c-oma\u201d) can result.\nProto-oncogenes\nThe genes that code for the positive cell-cycle regulators are called proto-oncogenes. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that,\nwhen mutated in certain ways, become oncogenes\u2014genes that cause a cell to become cancerous. Consider what might happen\nto the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene. In most instances, the alteration of the DNA sequence will result in a\nless functional (or non-functional) protein. The result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing\nthe cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward. If a cell cannot reproduce,\nthe mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal. Occasionally, however, a gene mutation causes a change that\nincreases the activity of a positive regulator. For example, a mutation that allows Cdk to be activated without being partnered\nwith cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are met. If the resulting daughter\ncells are too damaged to undergo further cell divisions, the mutation would not be propagated and no harm would come to the\norganism. However, if the atypical daughter cells are able to undergo further cell divisions, subsequent generations of cells may\naccumulate even more mutations, some possibly in additional genes that regulate the cell cycle.\nThe Cdk gene in the above example is only one of many genes that are considered proto-oncogenes. In addition to the cell-cycle\nregulatory proteins, any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to override cell-cycle checkpoints. An\noncogene is any gene that, when altered, leads to an increase in the rate of cell-cycle progression.\nTumor Suppressor Genes\nLike proto-oncogenes, many of the negative cell-cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become cancerous.\nTumor suppressor genes are segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins, the type of regulators that, when\nactivated, can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division. The collective function of the best-understood tumor\nsuppressor gene proteins, Rb, p53, and p21, is to put up a roadblock to cell-cycle progression until certain events are completed.\nA cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if there is a problem. Tumor\nsuppressors are similar to brakes in a vehicle: Malfunctioning brakes can contribute to a car crash!\nMutated p53 genes have been identified in more than 50 percent of all human tumor cells. This discovery is not surprising in\nlight of the multiple roles that the p53 protein plays at the G1 checkpoint. A cell with a faulty p53 may fail to detect errors present\nin the genomic DNA (Figure 10.14). Even if a partially functional p53 does identify the mutations, it may no longer be able to\nsignal the necessary DNA repair enzymes. Either way, damaged DNA will remain uncorrected. At this point, a functional p53\nwill deem the cell unsalvageable and trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis). The damaged version of p53 found in cancer\ncells, however, cannot trigger apoptosis.\n10.4 \u2022 Cancer and the Cell Cycle\n269\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 10.14 The role of normal p53 is to monitor DNA and the supply of oxygen (hypoxia is a condition of reduced oxygen supply). If\ndamage is detected, p53 triggers repair mechanisms. If repairs are unsuccessful, p53 signals apoptosis. A cell with an abnormal p53\nprotein cannot repair damaged DNA and thus cannot signal apoptosis. Cells with abnormal p53 can become cancerous. (credit:\nmodification of work by Thierry Soussi)\nHuman papillomavirus can cause cervical cancer. The virus encodes E6, a protein that binds p53. Based on this fact and what you\nknow about p53, what effect do you think E6 binding has on p53 activity?\na.\nE6 activates p53\nb.\nE6 inactivates p53\nc.\nE6 mutates p53\nd.\nE6 binding marks p53 for degradation\nThe loss of p53 function has other repercussions for the cell cycle. Mutated p53 might lose its ability to trigger p21 production.\nWithout adequate levels of p21, there is no effective block on Cdk activation. Essentially, without a fully functional p53, the G1\ncheckpoint is severely compromised and the cell proceeds directly from G1 to S regardless of internal and external conditions. At\nthe completion of this shortened cell cycle, two daughter cells are produced that have inherited the mutated p53 gene. Given the\nnon-optimal conditions under which the parent cell reproduced, it is likely that the daughter cells will have acquired other\nmutations in addition to the faulty tumor-suppressor gene. Cells such as these daughter cells quickly accumulate both\noncogenes and non-functional tumor-suppressor genes. Again, the result is tumor growth.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch an animation of how cancer results from errors in the cell cycle.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/cancer)\n270\nChapter 10 \u2022 Cell Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n10.5 Prokaryotic Cell Division\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the process of binary fission in prokaryotes\n\u2022\nExplain how FtsZ and tubulin proteins are examples of homology\nProkaryotes, such as bacteria, produce daughter cells by binary fission. For unicellular organisms, cell division is the only\nmethod to produce new individuals. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of\ndaughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. In unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals.\nTo achieve the outcome of cloned offspring, certain steps are essential. The genomic DNA must be replicated and then allocated\ninto the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the cellular machinery to sustain\nlife. As we\u2019ve seen with bacterial cells, the genome consists of a single, circular DNA chromosome; therefore, the process of cell\ndivision is simplified. Karyokinesis is unnecessary because there is no true nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the\nmultiple chromosomes into each daughter cell. This type of cell division is called binary (prokaryotic) fission.\nBinary Fission\nDue to the relative simplicity of the prokaryotes, the cell division process is a less complicated and much more rapid process\nthan cell division in eukaryotes. As a review of the general information on cell division we discussed at the beginning of this\nchapter, recall that the single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria occupies a specific location, the nucleoid region, within the\ncell (Figure 10.2). Although the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a\ncompact size, there are no histone proteins and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. The packing proteins of bacteria are,\nhowever, related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes.\nThe bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell. The starting point of\nreplication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.15). Replication of the\nDNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are\nformed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates,\nthe growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the\nelongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ\n(short for \u201cfilamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z\u201d) directs the partition between the nucleoids. Formation of the FtsZ ring\ntriggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site. A\nseptum is formed between the daughter nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When\nthe new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate.\n10.5 \u2022 Prokaryotic Cell Division\n271\nFigure 10.15 These images show the steps of binary fission in prokaryotes. (credit: modification of work by \u201cMcstrother\u201d/Wikimedia\nCommons)\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nMitotic Spindle Apparatus\nThe precise timing and formation of the mitotic spindle is critical to the success of eukaryotic cell division. Prokaryotic cells, on\nthe other hand, do not undergo karyokinesis and therefore have no need for a mitotic spindle. However, the FtsZ protein that\nplays such a vital role in prokaryotic cytokinesis is structurally and functionally very similar to tubulin, the building block of the\nmicrotubules which make up the mitotic spindle fibers that are necessary for eukaryotic nuclear division. FtsZ proteins can\nform filaments, rings, and other three-dimensional structures that resemble the way tubulin forms microtubules, centrioles,\n272\nChapter 10 \u2022 Cell Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nand various cytoskeletal components. In addition, both FtsZ and tubulin employ the same energy source, GTP (guanosine\ntriphosphate), to rapidly assemble and disassemble complex structures.\nFtsZ and tubulin are considered to be homologous structures derived from common evolutionary origins. In this example, FtsZ\nis the ancestor protein to tubulin (an evolutionarily derived protein). While both proteins are found in extant organisms, tubulin\nfunction has evolved and diversified tremendously since evolving from its FtsZ prokaryotic origin. A survey of mitotic assembly\ncomponents found in present-day unicellular eukaryotes reveals crucial intermediary steps to the complex membrane-enclosed\ngenomes of multicellular eukaryotes (Table 10.3).\nCell Division Apparatus among Various Organisms\nStructure of genetic\nmaterial\nDivision of nuclear material\nSeparation of\ndaughter cells\nProkaryotes\nThere is no nucleus.

The 46 chromosomes of human somatic cells are\ncomposed of 22 pairs of autosomes (matched pairs) and a\npair of sex chromosomes, which may or may not be\nmatched. This is the 2n or diploid state. Human gametes\nhave 23 chromosomes, or one complete set of chromosomes;\na set of chromosomes is complete with either one of the sex\nchromosomes, X or Y. This is the n or haploid state. Genes\nare segments of DNA that code for a specific functional\nmolecule (a protein or RNA). An organism\u2019s traits are\ndetermined by the genes inherited from each parent.\nDuplicated chromosomes are composed of two sister\nchromatids. Chromosomes are compacted using a variety of\nmechanisms during certain stages of the cell cycle. Several\nclasses of protein are involved in the organization and\npacking of the chromosomal DNA into a highly condensed\nstructure. The condensing complex compacts chromosomes,\nand the resulting condensed structure is necessary for\nchromosomal segregation during mitosis.\n10.2 The Cell Cycle\nThe cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events. Cells on the\npath to cell division proceed through a series of precisely\ntimed and carefully regulated stages. In eukaryotes, the cell\ncycle consists of a long preparatory period, called interphase,\nduring which chromosomes are replicated. Interphase is\ndivided into G1, S, and G2 phases. The mitotic phase begins\nwith karyokinesis (mitosis), which consists of five stages:\nprophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and\ntelophase. The final stage of the cell division process, and\nsometimes viewed as the final stage of the mitotic phase, is\ncytokinesis, during which the cytoplasmic components of\nthe daughter cells are separated either by an actin ring\n(animal cells) or by cell plate formation (plant cells).\n10.3 Control of the Cell Cycle\nEach step of the cell cycle is monitored by internal controls\ncalled checkpoints. There are three major checkpoints in the\ncell cycle: one near the end of G1, a second at the G2/M\ntransition, and the third during metaphase. Positive\nregulator molecules allow the cell cycle to advance to the next\nstage of cell division. Negative regulator molecules monitor\ncellular conditions and can halt the cycle until specific\nrequirements are met.\n10.4 Cancer and the Cell Cycle\nCancer is the result of unchecked cell division caused by a\nbreakdown of the mechanisms that regulate the cell cycle.\nThe loss of control begins with a change in the DNA sequence\nof a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules.\nFaulty instructions lead to a protein that does not function as\nit should. Any disruption of the monitoring system can allow\nother mistakes to be passed on to the daughter cells. Each\nsuccessive cell division will give rise to daughter cells with\neven more accumulated damage. Eventually, all checkpoints\nbecome nonfunctional, and rapidly reproducing cells crowd\nout normal cells, resulting in a tumor or leukemia (blood\ncancer).\n10.5 Prokaryotic Cell Division\nIn both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell division, the genomic\nDNA is replicated and then each copy is allocated into a\ndaughter cell. In addition, the cytoplasmic contents are\ndivided evenly and distributed to the new cells. However,\nthere are many differences between prokaryotic and\neukaryotic cell division. Bacteria have a single, circular DNA\nchromosome but no nucleus. Therefore, mitosis\n(karyokinesis) is not necessary in bacterial cell division.\nBacterial cytokinesis is directed by a ring composed of a\nprotein called FtsZ. Ingrowth of membrane and cell wall\nmaterial from the periphery of the cells results in the\nformation of a septum that eventually constructs the\nseparate cell walls of the daughter cells.\nChapter 10 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n275\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

(credit\na: modification of work by Frank Wouters; credit b: modification of work by Ken Cole, USGS; credit\nc: modification of work by Martin Pettitt)\nINTRODUCTION The ability to reproduce is a basic characteristic of all organisms: Hippopotamuses\ngive birth to hippopotamus calves; Joshua trees produce seeds from which Joshua tree seedlings emerge;\nand adult flamingos lay eggs that hatch into flamingo chicks. However, unlike the organisms shown\nabove, offspring may or may not resemble their parents. For example, in the case of most insects such as\nbutterflies (with a complete metamorphosis), the larval forms rarely resemble the adult forms.\nAlthough many unicellular organisms and a few multicellular organisms can produce genetically\nidentical clones of themselves through asexual reproduction, many single-celled organisms and most\nmulticellular organisms reproduce regularly using another method\u2014sexual reproduction. This highly\nevolved method involves the production by parents of two haploid cells and the fusion of two haploid\ncells to form a single, genetically recombined diploid cell\u2014a genetically unique organism. Haploid cells\nthat are part of the sexual reproductive cycle are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis. Sexual\nreproduction, involving both meiosis and fertilization, introduces variation into offspring that may\naccount for the evolutionary success of sexual reproduction. The vast majority of eukaryotic organisms,\nboth multicellular and unicellular, can or must employ some form of meiosis and fertilization to\nreproduce.\nIn most plants and animals, through thousands of rounds of mitotic cell division, diploid cells (whether\nproduced by asexual or sexual reproduction) will develop into an adult organism.\nChapter Outline\n11.1 The Process of\nMeiosis\n11.2 Sexual\nReproduction\n11.1 The Process of Meiosis\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis, and the differences between the first\nand second meiotic divisions\n\u2022\nDescribe the cellular events that take place during meiosis\n\u2022\nExplain the differences between meiosis and mitosis\n\u2022\nExplain the mechanisms within the meiotic process that produce genetic variation among\nthe haploid gametes\nSexual reproduction requires the union of two specialized cells, called gametes, each of which contains one\nset of chromosomes. When gametes unite, they form a zygote, or fertilized egg that contains two sets of\nchromosomes. (Note: Cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called haploid; cells containing two sets\nof chromosomes are called diploid.) If the reproductive cycle is to continue for any sexually reproducing\nspecies, then the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets to produce haploid\ngametes; otherwise, the number of chromosome sets will double with every future round of fertilization.\nTherefore, sexual reproduction requires a nuclear division that reduces the number of chromosome sets by\nhalf.\nMost animals and plants and many unicellular organisms are diploid and therefore have two sets of\nchromosomes. In each somatic cell of the organism (all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes\nor reproductive cells), the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome, called homologous\nchromosomes. Homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing the same genes in identical\nlocations along their lengths. Diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome from\neach parent.\nMeiosis is the nuclear division that forms haploid cells from diploid cells, and it employs many of the same\ncellular mechanisms as mitosis. However, as you have learned, mitosis produces daughter cells whose nuclei\nare genetically identical to the original parent nucleus. In mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei\nare at the same \u201cploidy level\u201d\u2014diploid in the case of most multicellular most animals. Plants use mitosis to\ngrow as sporophytes, and to grow and produce eggs and sperm as gametophytes; so they use mitosis for\nboth haploid and diploid cells (as well as for all other ploidies). In meiosis, the starting nucleus is always\ndiploid and the daughter nuclei that result are haploid. To achieve this reduction in chromosome number,\nmeiosis consists of one round of chromosome replication followed by two rounds of nuclear division.\nBecause the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the\nsame stage names are assigned. However, because there are two rounds of division, the major process and\nthe stages are designated with a \u201cI\u201d or a \u201cII.\u201d Thus, meiosis I is the first round of meiotic division and\nconsists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on. Likewise, Meiosis II (during which the second round of\nmeiotic division takes place) includes prophase II, prometaphase II, and so on.\nMeiosis I\nMeiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of G1, S, and G2 phases, which are nearly identical to the\nphases preceding mitosis. The G1 phase (the \u201cfirst gap phase\u201d) is focused on cell growth. During the S\nphase\u2014the second phase of interphase\u2014the cell copies or replicates the DNA of the chromosomes. Finally,\nin the G2 phase (the \u201csecond gap phase\u201d) the cell undergoes the final preparations for meiosis.\nDuring DNA duplication in the S phase, each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical\ncopies\u2014sister chromatids that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins, which hold the\nchromatids together until anaphase II.\nProphase I\nEarly in prophase I, before the chromosomes can be seen clearly with a microscope, the homologous\nchromosomes are attached at their tips to the nuclear envelope by proteins. As the nuclear envelope begins\nto break down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair closer together. Recall\nthat in mitosis, homologous chromosomes do not pair together. The synaptonemal complex, a lattice of\nproteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at specific locations and then spreads outward\n280\nChapter 11 \u2022 Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nto cover the entire length of the chromosomes. The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis. In\nsynapsis, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other. The\nsynaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between homologous nonsister chromatids\u2014a\nprocess called crossing over. Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as chiasmata (singular = chiasma) (Figure\n11.2).\nIn humans, even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not completely homologous (that is, most of their genes differ), there\nis a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase I. A partial synaptonemal\ncomplex develops only between the regions of homology.\nFigure 11.2 Early in prophase I, homologous chromosomes come together to form a synapse. The chromosomes are bound tightly together\nand in perfect alignment by a protein lattice called a synaptonemal complex and by cohesin proteins at the centromere.\nLocated at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules. These\nassemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover\u2014or genetic\nrecombination\u2014between the nonsister chromatids. Near the recombination nodule, the double-stranded DNA of each\nchromatid is cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between the nonsister chromatids. As prophase I\nprogresses, the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense. When the synaptonemal\ncomplex is gone, the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata. The\nchiasmata remain until anaphase I. The number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length of the chromosome.\nThere must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, but\nthere may be as many as 25. Following crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between\nhomologous pairs is removed. At the end of prophase I, the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata (Figure 11.3). These\npairs are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible.\nThe crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis. A single crossover event between\nhomologous nonsister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between a maternal chromosome and a\npaternal chromosome. When a recombinant sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry some DNA from one\nparent and some DNA from the other parent. The recombinant chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes\nthat did not exist before the crossover. Crossover events can occur almost anywhere along the length of the synapsed\nchromosomes. Different cells undergoing meiosis will therefore produce different recombinant chromatids, with varying\ncombinations of maternal and parental genes. Multiple crossovers in an arm of the chromosome have the same effect,\nexchanging segments of DNA to produce genetically recombined chromosomes.\n11.1 \u2022 The Process of Meiosis\n281\nFigure 11.3 Crossover occurs between nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. The result is an exchange of genetic material\nbetween homologous chromosomes.\nPrometaphase I\nThe key event in prometaphase I is the attachment of the spindle fiber microtubules to the kinetochore proteins at the\ncentromeres. Kinetochore proteins are multiprotein complexes that bind the centromeres of a chromosome to the microtubules\nof the mitotic spindle. Microtubules grow from microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs). In animal cells, MTOCs are\ncentrosomes located at opposite poles of the cell. The microtubules from each pole move toward the middle of the cell and attach\nto one of the kinetochores of the two fused homologous chromosomes. Each member of the homologous pair attaches to a\nmicrotubule extending from opposite poles of the cell so that in the next phase, the microtubules can pull the homologous pair\napart. A spindle fiber that has attached to a kinetochore is called a kinetochore microtubule. At the end of prometaphase I, each\ntetrad is attached to microtubules from both poles, with one homologous chromosome facing each pole. The homologous\nchromosomes are still held together at the chiasmata. In addition, the nuclear membrane has broken down entirely.\nMetaphase I\nDuring metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are arranged at the metaphase plate\u2014roughly in the midline of the cell,\nwith the kinetochores facing opposite poles. The homologous pairs orient themselves randomly at the equator. For example, if\nthe two homologous members of chromosome 1 are labeled a and b, then the chromosomes could line up a-b or b-a. This is\nimportant in determining the genes carried by a gamete, as each will only receive one of the two homologous chromosomes.\n(Recall that after crossing over takes place, homologous chromosomes are not identical. They contain slight differences in their\ngenetic information, causing each gamete to have a unique genetic makeup.)\nThe randomness in the alignment of recombined chromosomes at the metaphase plate, coupled with the crossing over events\nbetween nonsister chromatids, are responsible for much of the genetic variation in the offspring. To clarify this further,\nremember that the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing organism are originally inherited as two separate sets,\n282\nChapter 11 \u2022 Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\none from each parent. Using humans as an example, one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother.\nThe father provides the other set of 23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the egg. Every cell of the multicellular offspring\nhas copies of the original two sets of homologous chromosomes. In prophase I of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes form\nthe tetrads. In metaphase I, these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell to form the metaphase\nplate. Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or paternally inherited chromosome,\nthe arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random. Thus, any maternally inherited chromosome may face either\npole. Likewise, any paternally inherited chromosome may also face either pole. The orientation of each tetrad is independent of\nthe orientation of the other 22 tetrads.\nThis event\u2014the random (or independent) assortment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate\u2014is the second\nmechanism that introduces variation into the gametes or spores. In each cell that undergoes meiosis, the arrangement of the\ntetrads is different. The number of variations is dependent on the number of chromosomes making up a set. There are two\npossibilities for orientation at the metaphase plate; the possible number of alignments therefore equals 2n in a diploid cell,\nwhere n is the number of chromosomes per haploid set. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million\n(223) possible genetically-distinct gametes just from the random alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate. This\nnumber does not include the variability that was previously produced by crossing over between the nonsister chromatids. Given\nthese two mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the same genetic\ncomposition (Figure 11.4).\nTo summarize, meiosis I creates genetically diverse gametes in two ways. First, during prophase I, crossover events between the\nnonsister chromatids of each homologous pair of chromosomes generate recombinant chromatids with new combinations of\nmaternal and paternal genes. Second, the random assortment of tetrads on the metaphase plate produces unique combinations\nof maternal and paternal chromosomes that will make their way into the gametes.\nFigure 11.4 Random, independent assortment during metaphase I can be demonstrated by considering a cell with a set of two\n11.1 \u2022 The Process of Meiosis\n283\nchromosomes (n = 2). In this case, there are two possible arrangements at the equatorial plane in metaphase I. The total possible number\nof different gametes is 2n, where n equals the number of chromosomes in a set. In this example, there are four possible genetic\ncombinations for the gametes. With n = 23 in human cells, there are over eight million possible combinations of paternal and maternal\nchromosomes.\nAnaphase I\nIn anaphase I, the microtubules pull the linked chromosomes apart. The sister chromatids remain tightly bound together at the\ncentromere. The chiasmata are broken in anaphase I as the microtubules attached to the fused kinetochores pull the\nhomologous chromosomes apart (Figure 11.5).\nTelophase I and Cytokinesis\nIn telophase, the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles. The remainder of the typical telophase events may or may not\noccur, depending on the species. In some organisms, the chromosomes \u201cdecondense\u201d and nuclear envelopes form around the\nseparated sets of chromatids produced during telophase I. In other organisms, cytokinesis\u2014the physical separation of the\ncytoplasmic components into two daughter cells\u2014occurs without reformation of the nuclei. In nearly all species of animals and\nsome fungi, cytokinesis separates the cell contents via a cleavage furrow (constriction of the actin ring that leads to cytoplasmic\ndivision). In plants, a cell plate is formed during cell cytokinesis by Golgi vesicles fusing at the metaphase plate. This cell plate\nwill ultimately lead to the formation of cell walls that separate the two daughter cells.\nTwo haploid cells are the result of the first meiotic division of a diploid cell. The cells are haploid because at each pole, there is\njust one of each pair of the homologous chromosomes. Therefore, only one full set of the chromosomes is present. This is why\nthe cells are considered haploid\u2014there is only one chromosome set, even though each chromosome still consists of two sister\nchromatids. Recall that sister chromatids are merely duplicates of one of the two homologous chromosomes (except for changes\nthat occurred during crossing over). In meiosis II, these two sister chromatids will separate, creating four haploid daughter\ncells.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReview the process of meiosis, observing how chromosomes align and migrate, at Meiosis: An Interactive Animation\n(http://openstax.org/l/animal_meiosis) .\nMeiosis II\nIn some species, cells enter a brief interphase, or interkinesis, before entering meiosis II. Interkinesis lacks an S phase, so\nchromosomes are not duplicated. The two cells produced in meiosis I go through the events of meiosis II in synchrony. During\nmeiosis II, the sister chromatids within the two daughter cells separate, forming four new haploid gametes. The mechanics of\nmeiosis II are similar to mitosis, except that each dividing cell has only one set of homologous chromosomes, each with two\nchromatids. Therefore, each cell has half the number of sister chromatids to separate out as a diploid cell undergoing mitosis. In\nterms of chromosomal content, cells at the start of meiosis II are similar to haploid cells in G2, preparing to undergo mitosis.\nProphase II\nIf the chromosomes decondensed in telophase I, they condense again. If nuclear envelopes were formed, they fragment into\nvesicles. The MTOCs that were duplicated during interkinesis move away from each other toward opposite poles, and new\nspindles are formed.\nPrometaphase II\nThe nuclear envelopes are completely broken down, and the spindle is fully formed. Each sister chromatid forms an individual\nkinetochore that attaches to microtubules from opposite poles.\nMetaphase II\nThe sister chromatids are maximally condensed and aligned at the equator of the cell.\nAnaphase II\nThe sister chromatids are pulled apart by the kinetochore microtubules and move toward opposite poles. Nonkinetochore\nmicrotubules elongate the cell.\n284\nChapter 11 \u2022 Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 11.5 The process of chromosome alignment differs between meiosis I and meiosis II. In prometaphase I, microtubules attach to the\nfused kinetochores of homologous chromosomes, and the homologous chromosomes are arranged at the midline of the cell (the\nmetaphase plate) in metaphase I. In anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes separate. In prometaphase II, microtubules attach to the\nkinetochores of sister chromatids, and the sister chromatids are arranged at the midpoint of the cells in metaphase II. In anaphase II, the\nsister chromatids separate.\nTelophase II and Cytokinesis\nThe chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense. Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes. If the\nparent cell was diploid, as is most commonly the case, then cytokinesis now separates the two cells into four unique haploid\ncells. The cells produced are genetically unique because of the random assortment of paternal and maternal homologs and\nbecause of the recombination of maternal and paternal segments of chromosomes (with their sets of genes) that occurs during\ncrossover. The entire process of meiosis is outlined in Figure 11.6.\n11.1 \u2022 The Process of Meiosis\n285\nFigure 11.6 An animal cell with a diploid number of four (2n = 4) proceeds through the stages of meiosis to form four haploid daughter\ncells.\nComparing Meiosis and Mitosis\nMitosis and meiosis are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. They share some similarities, but also exhibit a\nnumber of important and distinct differences that lead to very different outcomes (Figure 11.7). Mitosis is a single nuclear\ndivision that results in two nuclei that are usually partitioned into two new cells. The nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are\ngenetically identical to the original nucleus. They have the same number of sets of chromosomes: one set in the case of haploid\ncells and two sets in the case of diploid cells. In contrast, meiosis consists of two nuclear divisions resulting in four nuclei that\nare usually partitioned into four new, genetically distinct cells. The four nuclei produced during meiosis are not genetically\nidentical, and they contain one chromosome set only. This is half the number of chromosome sets in the original cell, which is\n286\nChapter 11 \u2022 Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ndiploid.\nThe main differences between mitosis and meiosis occur in meiosis I, which is a very different nuclear division than mitosis. In\nmeiosis I, the homologous chromosome pairs physically meet and are bound together with the synaptonemal complex.\nFollowing this, the chromosomes develop chiasmata and undergo crossover between nonsister chromatids. In the end, the\nchromosomes line up along the metaphase plate as tetrads\u2014with kinetochore fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to\neach kinetochore of a homolog to form a tetrad. All of these events occur only in meiosis I.\nWhen the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another, the ploidy level\u2014the\nnumber of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus\u2014has been reduced from two to one. For this reason, meiosis I is referred\nto as a reductional division. There is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis.\nMeiosis II is analogous to a mitotic division. In this case, the duplicated chromosomes (only one set of them) line up on the\nmetaphase plate with divided kinetochores attached to kinetochore fibers from opposite poles. During anaphase II, as in\nmitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatid\u2014now referred to as a chromosome\u2014is pulled to one pole\nwhile the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole. If it were not for the fact that there had been crossover, the two\nproducts of each individual meiosis II division would be identical (as in mitosis). Instead, they are different because there has\nalways been at least one crossover per chromosome. Meiosis II is not a reduction division because although there are fewer\ncopies of the genome in the resulting cells, there is still one set of chromosomes, as there was at the end of meiosis I.\nFigure 11.7 Meiosis and mitosis are both preceded by one cycle of DNA replication; however, meiosis includes two nuclear divisions. The\nfour daughter cells resulting from meiosis are haploid and genetically distinct. The daughter cells resulting from mitosis are diploid and\n11.1 \u2022 The Process of Meiosis\n287\nidentical to the parent cell.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThe Mystery of the Evolution of Meiosis\nSome characteristics of organisms are so widespread and fundamental that it is sometimes difficult to remember that they\nevolved like other simple traits. Meiosis is such an extraordinarily complex series of cellular events that biologists have had\ntrouble testing hypotheses concerning how it may have evolved. Although meiosis is inextricably entwined with sexual\nreproduction and its advantages and disadvantages, it is important to separate the questions of the evolution of meiosis and the\nevolution of sex, because early meiosis may have been advantageous for different reasons than it is now. Thinking outside the\nbox and imagining what the early benefits from meiosis might have been is one approach to uncovering how it may have\nevolved.\nMeiosis and mitosis share obvious cellular processes, and it makes sense that meiosis evolved from mitosis. The difficulty lies in\nthe clear differences between meiosis I and mitosis. Adam Wilkins and Robin Holliday1 summarized the unique events that\nneeded to occur for the evolution of meiosis from mitosis. These steps are homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis,\ncrossover exchanges, sister chromatids remaining attached during anaphase, and suppression of DNA replication in interphase.\nThey argue that the first step is the hardest and most important and that understanding how it evolved would make the\nevolutionary process clearer. They suggest genetic experiments that might shed light on the evolution of synapsis.\nThere are other approaches to understanding the evolution of meiosis in progress. Different forms of meiosis exist in single-\ncelled protists. Some appear to be simpler or more \u201cprimitive\u201d forms of meiosis. Comparing the meiotic divisions of different\nprotists may shed light on the evolution of meiosis. Marilee Ramesh and colleagues2 compared the genes involved in meiosis in\nprotists to understand when and where meiosis might have evolved. Although research is still ongoing, recent scholarship into\nmeiosis in protists suggests that some aspects of meiosis may have evolved later than others. This kind of genetic comparison\ncan tell us what aspects of meiosis are the oldest and what cellular processes they may have borrowed from in earlier cells.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick through the steps of this interactive animation to compare the meiotic process of cell division to that of mitosis at How\nCells Divide (http://openstax.org/l/how_cells_dvide) .\n11.2 Sexual Reproduction\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain that meiosis and sexual reproduction are highly evolved traits\n\u2022\nIdentify variation among offspring as a potential evolutionary advantage of sexual reproduction\n\u2022\nDescribe the three different life-cycle types among sexually reproducing multicellular organisms.\nSexual reproduction was likely an early evolutionary innovation after the appearance of eukaryotic cells. It appears to have been\nvery successful because most eukaryotes are able to reproduce sexually and, in many animals, it is the only mode of\nreproduction. And yet, scientists also recognize some real disadvantages to sexual reproduction. On the surface, creating\noffspring that are genetic clones of the parent appears to be a better system. If the parent organism is successfully occupying a\nhabitat, offspring with the same traits should be similarly successful. There is also the obvious benefit to an organism that can\nproduce offspring whenever circumstances are favorable by asexual budding, fragmentation, or by producing eggs asexually.\nThese methods of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite sex. Indeed, some organisms that lead a\nsolitary lifestyle have retained the ability to reproduce asexually. In addition, in asexual populations, every individual is capable\nof reproduction. In sexual populations, the males are not producing the offspring themselves, so hypothetically an asexual\n1Adam S. Wilkins and Robin Holliday, \u201cThe Evolution of Meiosis from Mitosis,\u201d Genetics 181 (2009): 3\u201312.\n2Marilee A. Ramesh, Shehre-Banoo Malik and John M.

Why are meiosis and\nsexual reproductive strategies so common? These are important (and as yet unanswered) questions in biology, even though they\nhave been the focus of much research beginning in the latter half of the 20th century. There are several possible explanations,\none of which is that the variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very important to the survival and\nreproduction of the population. Thus, on average, a sexually reproducing population will leave more descendants than an\notherwise similar asexually reproducing population. The only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation. Mutations\nthat take place during the formation of germ cell lines are also the ultimate source of variation in sexually reproducing\norganisms. However, in contrast to mutation during asexual reproduction, the mutations during sexual reproduction can be\ncontinually reshuffled from one generation to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes are\nmixed into different combinations by crossovers during prophase I and random assortment at metaphase I.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThe Red Queen Hypothesis\nGenetic variation is the outcome of sexual reproduction, but why are ongoing variations necessary, even under seemingly stable\nenvironmental conditions? Enter the Red Queen hypothesis, first proposed by Leigh Van Valen in 1973.3 The concept was named\nin reference to the Red Queen's race in Lewis Carroll's book, Through the Looking-Glass.\nAll species coevolve (evolve together) with other organisms. For example, predators evolve with their prey, and parasites evolve\nwith their hosts. Each tiny advantage gained by favorable variation gives a species a reproductive edge over close competitors,\npredators, parasites, or even prey. However, survival of any given genotype or phenotype in a population is dependent on the\nreproductive fitness of other genotypes or phenotypes within a given species. The only method that will allow a coevolving\nspecies to maintain its own share of the resources is to also continually improve its fitness (the capacity of the members to\nproduce more reproductively viable offspring relative to others within a species). As one species gains an advantage, this\nincreases selection on the other species; they must also develop an advantage or they will be outcompeted. No single species\nprogresses too far ahead because genetic variation among the progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a\nmechanism to improve rapidly. Species that cannot keep up become extinct. The Red Queen\u2019s catchphrase was, \u201cIt takes all the\nrunning you can do to stay in the same place.\u201d This is an apt description of coevolution between competing species.\nLife Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms\nFertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles. What happens between these two events depends on the organism\u2019s\n\u201creproductive strategy.\u201d The process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half. Fertilization, the joining of two haploid\ngametes, restores the diploid condition. Some organisms have a multicellular diploid stage that is most obvious and only\nproduce haploid reproductive cells. Animals, including humans, have this type of life cycle. Other organisms, such as fungi, have\na multicellular haploid stage that is most obvious. Plants and some algae have alternation of generations, in which they have\nmulticellular diploid and haploid life stages that are apparent to different degrees depending on the group.\nNearly all animals employ a diploid-dominant life-cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are\nthe gametes. Early in the development of the embryo, specialized diploid cells, called germ cells, are produced within the\ngonads (such as the testes and ovaries). Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the germ cell line and meiosis to produce\nhaploid gametes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again. There is no multicellular haploid life\nstage. Fertilization occurs with the fusion of two gametes, usually from different individuals, restoring the diploid state (Figure\n11.8).\n3Leigh Van Valen, \u201cA New Evolutionary Law,\u201d Evolutionary Theory 1 (1973): 1\u201330\n11.2 \u2022 Sexual Reproduction\n289\nFigure 11.8 In animals, sexually reproducing adults form haploid gametes from diploid germ cells. Fusion of the gametes gives rise to a\nfertilized egg cell, or zygote. The zygote will undergo multiple rounds of mitosis to produce a multicellular offspring. The germ cells are\ngenerated early in the development of the zygote.\nMost fungi and algae employ a life-cycle type in which the \u201cbody\u201d of the organism\u2014the ecologically important part of the life\ncycle\u2014is haploid. The haploid cells that make up the tissues of the dominant multicellular stage are formed by mitosis. During\nsexual reproduction, specialized haploid cells from two individuals\u2014designated the (+) and (\u2212) mating types\u2014join to form a\ndiploid zygote. The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis to form four haploid cells called spores. Although these spores are\nhaploid like the \u201cparents,\u201d they contain a new genetic combination from two parents. The spores can remain dormant for various\ntime periods. Eventually, when conditions are favorable, the spores form multicellular haploid structures through many rounds\nof mitosis (Figure 11.9).\n290\nChapter 11 \u2022 Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 11.9 Fungi, such as black bread mold (Rhizopus nigricans), have a haploid multicellular stage that produces specialized haploid cells\nby mitosis that fuse to form a diploid zygote.

Species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life\ncycle. The haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes, because they produce gametes from specialized cells. Meiosis is\nnot directly involved in the production of gametes in this case, because the organism that produces the gametes is already\nhaploid. Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote. The zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise\nto a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte. Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce\nhaploid spores. The spores will subsequently develop into the gametophytes (Figure 11.10).\n11.2 \u2022 Sexual Reproduction\n291\nFigure 11.10 Plants have a life cycle that alternates between a multicellular haploid organism and a multicellular diploid organism. In some\nplants, such as ferns, both the haploid and diploid plant stages are free-living. The diploid plant is called a sporophyte because it produces\nhaploid spores by meiosis. The spores develop into multicellular, haploid plants that are called gametophytes because they produce\ngametes. The gametes of two individuals will fuse to form a diploid zygote that becomes the sporophyte.

In plants such as moss, the gametophyte organism is the free-\nliving plant and the sporophyte is physically dependent on the gametophyte. In other plants, such as ferns, both the\ngametophyte and sporophyte plants are free-living; however, the sporophyte is much larger. In seed plants, such as magnolia\ntrees and daisies, the gametophyte is composed of only a few cells and, in the case of the female gametophyte, is completely\nretained within the sporophyte.\nSexual reproduction takes many forms in multicellular organisms. The fact that nearly every multicellular organism on Earth\nemploys sexual reproduction is strong evidence for the benefits of producing offspring with unique gene combinations, though\nthere are other possible benefits as well.\n292\nChapter 11 \u2022 Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nalternation of generations\nlife-cycle type in which the\ndiploid and haploid stages alternate\nchiasmata\n(singular, chiasma) the structure that forms at\nthe crossover points after genetic material is exchanged\ncohesin\nproteins that form a complex that seals sister\nchromatids together at their centromeres until anaphase\nII of meiosis\ncrossover\nexchange of genetic material between nonsister\nchromatids resulting in chromosomes that incorporate\ngenes from both parents of the organism\nfertilization\nunion of two haploid cells from two individual\norganisms\ngametophyte\na multicellular haploid life-cycle stage that\nproduces gametes\ngerm cells\nspecialized cell line that produces gametes, such\nas eggs or sperm\ninterkinesis\n(also, interphase II) brief period of rest\nbetween meiosis I and meiosis II\nlife cycle\nthe sequence of events in the development of an\norganism and the production of cells that produce\noffspring\nmeiosis\na nuclear division process that results in four\nhaploid cells\nmeiosis I\nfirst round of meiotic cell division; referred to as\nreduction division because the ploidy level is reduced\nfrom diploid to haploid\nmeiosis II\nsecond round of meiotic cell division following\nmeiosis I; sister chromatids are separated into individual\nchromosomes, and the result is four unique haploid cells\nrecombination nodules\nprotein assemblies formed on the\nsynaptonemal complex that mark the points of crossover\nevents and mediate the multistep process of genetic\nrecombination between nonsister chromatids\nreduction division\nnuclear division that produces daughter\nnuclei each having one-half as many chromosome sets as\nthe parental nucleus; meiosis I is a reduction division\nsomatic cell\nall the cells of a multicellular organism except\nthe gametes or reproductive cells\nspore\nhaploid cell that can produce a haploid multicellular\norganism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid\ncell\nsporophyte\na multicellular diploid life-cycle stage that\nproduces haploid spores by meiosis\nsynapsis\nformation of a close association between\nhomologous chromosomes during prophase I\nsynaptonemal complex\nprotein lattice that forms between\nhomologous chromosomes during prophase I,\nsupporting crossover\ntetrad\ntwo duplicated homologous chromosomes (four\nchromatids) bound together by chiasmata during\nprophase I\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n11.1 The Process of Meiosis\nSexual reproduction requires that organisms produce cells\nthat can fuse during fertilization to produce offspring. In\nmost animals, meiosis is used to produce haploid eggs and\nsperm from diploid parent cells so that the fusion of an egg\nand sperm produces a diploid zygote. As with mitosis, DNA\nreplication occurs prior to meiosis during the S-phase of the\ncell cycle so that each chromosome becomes a pair of sister\nchromatids. In meiosis, there are two rounds of nuclear\ndivision resulting in four nuclei and usually four daughter\ncells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the\nparent cell. The first division separates homologs, and the\nsecond\u2014like mitosis\u2014separates chromatids into individual\nchromosomes. Meiosis generates variation in the daughter\nnuclei during crossover in prophase I as well as during the\nrandom alignment of tetrads at metaphase I. The cells that\nare produced by meiosis are genetically unique.\nMeiosis and mitosis share similar processes, but have\ndistinct outcomes. Mitotic divisions are single nuclear\ndivisions that produce genetically identical daughter nuclei\n(i.e., each daughter nucleus has the same number of\nchromosome sets as the original cell). In contrast, meiotic\ndivisions include two nuclear divisions that ultimately\nproduce four genetically different daughter nuclei that have\nonly one chromosome set (instead of the two sets of\nchromosomes in the parent cell). The main differences\nbetween the two nuclear division processes take place during\nthe first division of meiosis: homologous chromosomes pair,\ncrossover, and exchange homologous nonsister chromatid\nsegments. The homologous chromosomes separate into\ndifferent nuclei during meiosis I, causing a reduction of\nploidy level in the first division. The second division of\nmeiosis is similar to a mitotic division, except that the\ndaughter cells do not contain identical genomes because of\ncrossover and chromosome recombination in prophase I.\n11.2 Sexual Reproduction\nNearly all eukaryotes undergo sexual reproduction. The\nvariation introduced into the reproductive cells by meiosis\nprovides an important advantage that has made sexual\nreproduction evolutionarily successful. Meiosis and\nfertilization alternate in sexual life cycles. The process of\nmeiosis produces unique reproductive cells called gametes,\nwhich have half the number of chromosomes as the parent\ncell. When two haploid gametes fuse, this restores the\nChapter 11 \u2022 Key Terms\n293\ndiploid condition in the new zygote. Thus, most sexually\nreproducing organisms alternate between haploid and\ndiploid stages. However, the ways in which reproductive cells\nare produced and the timing between meiosis and\nfertilization vary greatly.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

(credit: modification of work by Jerry Kirkhart)\nINTRODUCTION Genetics is the study of heredity. Johann Gregor Mendel set the framework for\ngenetics long before chromosomes or genes had been identified, at a time when meiosis was not well\nunderstood. Mendel selected a simple biological system and conducted methodical, quantitative\nanalyses using large sample sizes. Because of Mendel\u2019s work, the fundamental principles of heredity\nwere revealed. We now know that genes, carried on chromosomes, are the basic functional units of\nheredity with the capability to be replicated, expressed, or mutated. Today, the postulates put forth by\nMendel form the basis of classical, or Mendelian, genetics. Not all genes are transmitted from parents to\noffspring according to Mendelian genetics, but Mendel\u2019s experiments serve as an excellent starting point\nfor thinking about inheritance.\nChapter Outline\n12.1 Mendel\u2019s\nExperiments and\nthe Laws of\nProbability\n12.2 Characteristics and\nTraits\n12.3 Laws of Inheritance\n12.1 Mendel\u2019s Experiments and the Laws of\nProbability\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the scientific reasons for the success of Mendel\u2019s experimental work\n\u2022\nDescribe the expected outcomes of monohybrid crosses involving dominant and recessive\nalleles\n\u2022\nApply the sum and product rules to calculate probabilities\nFigure 12.2 Johann Gregor Mendel is considered the father of genetics.\nJohann Gregor Mendel (1822\u20131884) (Figure 12.2) was a lifelong learner, teacher, scientist, and man of faith.\nAs a young adult, he joined the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic.\nSupported by the monastery, he taught physics, botany, and natural science courses at the secondary and\nuniversity levels. In 1856, he began a decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in\nhoneybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system (a system with\nconvenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems). In\n1865, Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local Natural\nHistory Society. He demonstrated that traits are transmitted from parents to offspring independently of\nother traits and in dominant and recessive patterns. In 1866, he published his work, Experiments in Plant\nHybridization,1 in the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Br\u00fcnn.\nMendel\u2019s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community, which believed, incorrectly, that the\nprocess of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical\nappearance in offspring. The blending theory of inheritance asserted that the original parental traits were\nlost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring, but we now know that this is not the case. This hypothetical\nprocess appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation. Continuous variation\nresults from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height. Offspring appear to\nbe a \u201cblend\u201d of their parents\u2019 traits.\nInstead of continuous characteristics, Mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes\n(specifically, violet versus white flowers); this is referred to as discontinuous variation. Mendel\u2019s choice of\nthese kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring, nor\n1Johann Gregor Mendel, Versuche \u00fcber Pflanzenhybriden Verhandlungen des naturforschenden Vereines in Br\u00fcnn, Bd. IV f\u00fcr das\nJahr, 1865 Abhandlungen, 3\u201347. [for English translation see http://www.mendelweb.org/Mendel.plain.html (http://openstax.org/l/\nmendel_experiments) ]\n298\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nwere they absorbed, but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on. In 1868, Mendel became abbot of the\nmonastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties. He was not recognized for his extraordinary scientific\ncontributions during his lifetime. In fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and revitalized by\nscientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of heredity.\nMendel\u2019s Model System\nMendel\u2019s seminal work was accomplished using the garden pea, Pisum sativum, to study inheritance. This species naturally self-\nfertilizes, such that pollen encounters ova within individual flowers. The flower petals remain sealed tightly until after\npollination, preventing pollination from other plants. The result is highly inbred, or \u201ctrue-breeding,\u201d pea plants. These are plants\nthat always produce offspring that look like the parent. By experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, Mendel avoided the\nappearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true breeding. The garden pea also grows to\nmaturity within one season, meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short time. Finally, large\nquantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing Mendel to conclude that his results did not come about\nsimply by chance.\nMendelian Crosses\nMendel performed hybridizations, which involve mating two true-breeding individuals that have different traits. In the pea,\nwhich is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one\nvariety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety. In plants, pollen carries the male gametes (sperm) to\nthe stigma, a sticky organ that traps pollen and allows the sperm to move down the pistil to the female gametes (ova) below. To\nprevent the pea plant that was receiving pollen from self-fertilizing and confounding his results, Mendel painstakingly removed\nall of the anthers from the plant\u2019s flowers before they had a chance to mature.\nPlants used in first-generation crosses were called P0, or parental generation one (Figure 12.3). After each cross, Mendel\ncollected the seeds belonging to the P0 plants and grew them the following season. These offspring were called the F1, or the first\nfilial (filial = offspring, daughter or son) generation. Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants, he\nallowed them to self-fertilize naturally. He then collected and grew the seeds from the F1 plants to produce the F2, or second\nfilial, generation. Mendel\u2019s experiments extended beyond the F2 generation to the F3 and F4generations, and so on, but it was\nthe ratio of characteristics in the P0\u2212F1\u2212F2 generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for Mendel\u2019s\npostulates.\n12.1 \u2022 Mendel\u2019s Experiments and the Laws of Probability\n299\nFigure 12.3 In one of his experiments on inheritance patterns, Mendel crossed plants that were true-breeding for violet flower color with\nplants true-breeding for white flower color (the P generation). The resulting hybrids in the F1 generation all had violet flowers. In the F2\ngeneration, approximately three quarters of the plants had violet flowers, and one quarter had white flowers.\nGarden Pea Characteristics Revealed the Basics of Heredity\nIn his 1865 publication, Mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics, each with two\ncontrasting traits. A trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic. The characteristics\nincluded plant height, seed texture, seed color, flower color, pea pod size, pea pod color, and flower position. For the\ncharacteristic of flower color, for example, the two contrasting traits were white versus violet. To fully examine each\ncharacteristic, Mendel generated large numbers of F1and F2 plants, reporting results from 19,959 F2 plants alone. His findings\nwere consistent.\nWhat results did Mendel find in his crosses for flower color? First, Mendel confirmed that he had plants that bred true for white\nor violet flower color. Regardless of how many generations Mendel examined, all self-crossed offspring of parents with white\nflowers had white flowers, and all self-crossed offspring of parents with violet flowers had violet flowers. In addition, Mendel\n300\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nconfirmed that, other than flower color, the pea plants were physically identical.\nOnce these validations were complete, Mendel applied the pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with\nwhite flowers. After gathering and sowing the seeds that resulted from this cross, Mendel found that 100 percent of the F1 hybrid\ngeneration had violet flowers. Conventional wisdom at that time (the blending theory) would have predicted the hybrid flowers\nto be pale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal numbers of white and violet flowers. In other words, the contrasting parental\ntraits were expected to blend in the offspring. Instead, Mendel\u2019s results demonstrated that the white flower trait in the F1\ngeneration had completely disappeared.\nImportantly, Mendel did not stop his experimentation there. He allowed the F1 plants to self-fertilize and found that, of\nF2-generation plants, 705 had violet flowers and 224 had white flowers. This was a ratio of 3.15 violet flowers per one white\nflower, or approximately 3:1. When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white\nflowers and vice versa, he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent, male or female, contributed which trait.\nThis is called a reciprocal cross\u2014a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the\nrespective traits of the female and male in the other cross. For the other six characteristics Mendel examined, the F1 and F2\ngenerations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color. One of the two traits would disappear completely from the F1\ngeneration only to reappear in the F2 generation at a ratio of approximately 3:1 (Table 12.1).\nThe Results of Mendel\u2019s Garden Pea Hybridizations\nCharacteristic\nContrasting P0 Traits\nF1 Offspring Traits\nF2 Offspring Traits\nF2 Trait Ratios\nFlower color\nViolet vs. white\n100 percent violet\n705 violet\n224 white\n3.15:1\nFlower position\nAxial vs. terminal\n100 percent axial\n651 axial\n207 terminal\n3.14:1\nPlant height\nTall vs. dwarf\n100 percent tall\n787 tall\n277 dwarf\n2.84:1\nSeed texture\nRound vs. wrinkled\n100 percent round\n5,474 round\n1,850 wrinkled\n2.96:1\nSeed color\nYellow vs. green\n100 percent yellow\n6,022 yellow\n2,001 green\n3.01:1\nPea pod texture\nInflated vs. constricted\n100 percent inflated\n882 inflated\n299 constricted\n2.95:1\nPea pod color\nGreen vs. yellow\n100 percent green\n428 green\n152 yellow\n2.82:1\nTable 12.1\nUpon compiling his results for many thousands of plants, Mendel concluded that the characteristics could be divided into\nexpressed and latent traits. He called these, respectively, dominant and recessive traits. Dominant traits are those that are\ninherited unchanged in a hybridization. Recessive traits become latent, or disappear, in the offspring of a hybridization. The\nrecessive trait does, however, reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring. An example of a dominant trait is the violet-flower\ntrait. For this same characteristic (flower color), white-colored flowers are a recessive trait. The fact that the recessive trait\n12.1 \u2022 Mendel\u2019s Experiments and the Laws of Probability\n301\nreappeared in the F2 generation meant that the traits remained separate (not blended) in the plants of the F1 generation. Mendel\nalso proposed that plants possessed two copies of the trait for the flower-color characteristic, and that each parent transmitted\none of its two copies to its offspring, where they came together. Moreover, the physical observation of a dominant trait could\nmean that the genetic composition of the organism included two dominant versions of the characteristic or that it included one\ndominant and one recessive version. Conversely, the observation of a recessive trait meant that the organism lacked any\ndominant versions of this characteristic.\nSo why did Mendel repeatedly obtain 3:1 ratios in his crosses? To understand how Mendel deduced the basic mechanisms of\ninheritance that lead to such ratios, we must first review the laws of probability.\nProbability Basics\nProbabilities are mathematical measures of likelihood. The empirical probability of an event is calculated by dividing the\nnumber of times the event occurs by the total number of opportunities for the event to occur. It is also possible to calculate\ntheoretical probabilities by dividing the number of times that an event is expected to occur by the number of times that it could\noccur. Empirical probabilities come from observations, like those of Mendel. Theoretical probabilities, on the other hand, come\nfrom knowing how the events are produced and assuming that the probabilities of individual outcomes are equal. A probability\nof one for some event indicates that it is guaranteed to occur, whereas a probability of zero indicates that it is guaranteed not to\noccur. An example of a genetic event is a round seed produced by a pea plant.\nIn one experiment, Mendel demonstrated that the probability of the event \u201cround seed\u201d occurring was one in the F1 offspring of\ntrue-breeding parents, one of which has round seeds and one of which has wrinkled seeds. When the F1 plants were\nsubsequently self-crossed, the probability of any given F2 offspring having round seeds was now three out of four. In other\nwords, in a large population of F2 offspring chosen at random, 75 percent were expected to have round seeds, whereas 25 percent\nwere expected to have wrinkled seeds. Using large numbers of crosses, Mendel was able to calculate probabilities and use these\nto predict the outcomes of other crosses.\nThe Product Rule and Sum Rule\nMendel demonstrated that pea plants transmit characteristics as discrete units from parent to offspring. As will be discussed,\nMendel also determined that different characteristics, like seed color and seed texture, were transmitted independently of one\nanother and could be considered in separate probability analyses. For instance, performing a cross between a plant with green,\nwrinkled seeds and a plant with yellow, round seeds still produced offspring that had a 3:1 ratio of yellow:green seeds (ignoring\nseed texture) and a 3:1 ratio of wrinkled:round seeds (ignoring seed color). The characteristics of color and texture did not\ninfluence each other.\nThe product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics. The\nproduct rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the\nindividual probabilities of each event occurring alone. To demonstrate the product rule, imagine that you are rolling a six-sided\ndie (D) and flipping a penny (P) at the same time. The die may roll any number from 1\u20136 (D#), whereas the penny may turn up\nheads (PH) or tails (PT). The outcome of rolling the die has no effect on the outcome of flipping the penny and vice versa. There\nare 12 possible outcomes of this action (Table 12.2), and each event is expected to occur with equal probability.\nTwelve Equally Likely Outcomes of Rolling a Die and Flipping a Penny\nRolling Die\nFlipping Penny\nD1\nPH\nD1\nPT\nD2\nPH\nD2\nPT\nTable 12.2\n302\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nRolling Die\nFlipping Penny\nD3\nPH\nD3\nPT\nD4\nPH\nD4\nPT\nD5\nPH\nD5\nPT\nD6\nPH\nD6\nPT\nTable 12.2\nOf the 12 possible outcomes, the die has a 2/12 (or 1/6) probability of rolling a two, and the penny has a 6/12 (or 1/2) probability of\ncoming up heads. By the product rule, the probability that you will obtain the combined outcome 2 and heads is: (D2) x (PH) = (1/\n6) x (1/2) or 1/12 (Table 12.3). Notice the word \u201cand\u201d in the description of the probability. The \u201cand\u201d is a signal to apply the product\nrule. For example, consider how the product rule is applied to the dihybrid cross: the probability of having both dominant traits\n(for example, yellow and round) in the F2 progeny is the product of the probabilities of having the dominant trait for each\ncharacteristic, as shown here:\nOn the other hand, the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come\nabout by more than one pathway. The sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event, of\ntwo mutually exclusive events, is the sum of their individual probabilities. Notice the word \u201cor\u201d in the description of the\nprobability. The \u201cor\u201d indicates that you should apply the sum rule. In this case, let\u2019s imagine you are flipping a penny (P) and a\nquarter (Q). What is the probability of one coin coming up heads and one coin coming up tails? This outcome can be achieved by\ntwo cases: the penny may be heads (PH) and the quarter may be tails (QT), or the quarter may be heads (QH) and the penny may\nbe tails (PT). Either case fulfills the outcome. By the sum rule, we calculate the probability of obtaining one head and one tail as\n[(PH) \u00d7 (QT)] + [(QH) \u00d7 (PT)] = [(1/2) \u00d7 (1/2)] + [(1/2) \u00d7 (1/2)] = 1/2 (Table 12.3). You should also notice that we used the product rule to\ncalculate the probability of PH and QT, and also the probability of PT and QH, before we summed them. Again, the sum rule can\nbe applied to show the probability of having at least one dominant trait in the F2 generation of a dihybrid cross:\nThe Product Rule and Sum Rule\nProduct Rule\nSum Rule\nFor independent events A and B, the probability (P) of them\nboth occurring (A and B) is (PA \u00d7 PB)\nFor mutually exclusive events A and B, the probability (P) that\nat least one occurs (A or B) is (PA + PB)\nTable 12.3\nTo use probability laws in practice, we must work with large sample sizes because small sample sizes are prone to deviations\n12.1 \u2022 Mendel\u2019s Experiments and the Laws of Probability\n303\ncaused by chance. The large quantities of pea plants that Mendel examined allowed him calculate the probabilities of the traits\nappearing in his F2 generation. As you will learn, this discovery meant that when parental traits were known, the offspring\u2019s\ntraits could be predicted accurately even before fertilization.\n12.2 Characteristics and Traits\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes in dominant and recessive gene systems\n\u2022\nDevelop a Punnett square to calculate the expected proportions of genotypes and phenotypes in a\nmonohybrid cross\n\u2022\nExplain the purpose and methods of a test cross\n\u2022\nIdentify non-Mendelian inheritance patterns such as incomplete dominance, codominance, recessive lethals,\nmultiple alleles, and sex linkage\nPhysical characteristics are expressed through genes carried on chromosomes. The genetic makeup of peas consists of two\nsimilar, or homologous, copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. Each pair of homologous chromosomes has the\nsame linear order of genes. In other words, peas are diploid organisms in that they have two copies of each chromosome. The\nsame is true for many other plants and for virtually all animals. Diploid organisms produce haploid gametes, which contain one\ncopy of each homologous chromosome that unite at fertilization to create a diploid zygote.\nFor cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not\nencode the same version of that characteristic. Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on\nhomologous chromosomes are called alleles. Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms, but it is\ncommon to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population.\nPhenotypes and Genotypes\nTwo alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. The observable\ntraits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype. An organism\u2019s underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both\nphysically visible and non-expressed alleles, is called its genotype. Mendel\u2019s hybridization experiments demonstrate the\ndifference between phenotype and genotype. When true-breeding plants in which one parent had yellow pods and one had\ngreen pods were cross-fertilized, all of the F1 hybrid offspring had yellow pods. That is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically\nidentical to the true-breeding parent with yellow pods. However, we know that the allele donated by the parent with green pods\nwas not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F2 offspring. Therefore, the F1 plants must have been genotypically\ndifferent from the parent with yellow pods.\nThe P1 plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms that\nare homozygous at a given gene, or locus, have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes. Mendel\u2019s\nparental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait. When P1 plants with\ncontrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait, meaning that their\ngenotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined.\nDominant and Recessive Alleles\nOur discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to why the F1 heterozygous offspring were identical to\none of the parents, rather than expressing both alleles. In all seven pea-plant characteristics, one of the two contrasting alleles\nwas dominant, and the other was recessive. Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive allele was\nreferred to as the latent unit factor. We now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on homologous\nchromosome pairs. For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant and heterozygous\norganisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype). The recessive allele will only be\nobserved in homozygous recessive individuals (Table 12.4).\n304\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nHuman Inheritance in Dominant and Recessive Patterns\nDominant Traits\nRecessive Traits\nAchondroplasia\nAlbinism\nBrachydactyly\nCystic fibrosis\nHuntington\u2019s disease\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy\nMarfan syndrome\nGalactosemia\nNeurofibromatosis\nPhenylketonuria\nWidow\u2019s peak\nSickle-cell anemia\nWooly hair\nTay-Sachs disease\nTable 12.4\nSeveral conventions exist for referring to genes and alleles. For the purposes of this chapter, we will abbreviate genes using the\nfirst letter of the gene\u2019s corresponding dominant trait. For example, violet is the dominant trait for a pea plant\u2019s flower color, so\nthe flower-color gene would be abbreviated as V (note that it is customary to italicize gene designations). Furthermore, we will\nuse uppercase and lowercase letters to represent dominant and recessive alleles, respectively. Therefore, we would refer to the\ngenotype of a homozygous dominant pea plant with violet flowers as VV, a homozygous recessive pea plant with white flowers\nas vv, and a heterozygous pea plant with violet flowers as Vv.\nThe Punnett Square Approach for a Monohybrid Cross\nWhen fertilization occurs between two true-breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic, the process is called a\nmonohybrid cross, and the resulting offspring are monohybrids. Mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving\ncontrasting traits for each characteristic. On the basis of his results in F1 and F2 generations, Mendel postulated that each parent\nin the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each offspring, and every possible combination of unit\nfactors was equally likely.\nTo demonstrate a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea plants with yellow versus green pea seeds. The\ndominant seed color is yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes were YY for the plants with yellow seeds and yy for the plants\nwith green seeds, respectively. A Punnett square, devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett, can be drawn that applies\nthe rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies. To prepare\na Punnett square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top (for one parent) and side (for the other\nparent) of a grid, representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes. Then the combinations of egg and sperm are\nmade in the boxes in the table to show which alleles are combining. Each box then represents the diploid genotype of a zygote,\nor fertilized egg, that could result from this mating. Because each possibility is equally likely, genotypic ratios can be\ndetermined from a Punnett square. If the pattern of inheritance (dominant or recessive) is known, the phenotypic ratios can be\ninferred as well. For a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding parents, each parent contributes one type of allele. In this case,\nonly one genotype is possible. All offspring are Yy and have yellow seeds (Figure 12.4).\n12.2 \u2022 Characteristics and Traits\n305\nFigure 12.4 In the P generation, pea plants that are true-breeding for the dominant yellow phenotype are crossed with plants with the\nrecessive green phenotype. This cross produces F1 heterozygotes with a yellow phenotype. Punnett square analysis can be used to predict\nthe genotypes of the F2 generation.\nA self-cross of one of the Yy heterozygous offspring can be represented in a 2 \u00d7 2 Punnett square because each parent can donate\none of two different alleles. Therefore, the offspring can potentially have one of four allele combinations: YY, Yy, yY, or yy (Figure\n12.4). Notice that there are two ways to obtain the Yy genotype: a Y from the egg and a y from the sperm, or a y from the egg and\na Y from the sperm. Both of these possibilities must be counted. Recall that Mendel\u2019s pea-plant characteristics behaved in the\nsame way in reciprocal crosses. Therefore, the two possible heterozygous combinations produce offspring that are genotypically\nand phenotypically identical despite their dominant and recessive alleles deriving from different parents. They are grouped\ntogether. Because fertilization is a random event, we expect each combination to be equally likely and for the offspring to exhibit\na ratio of YY:Yy:yy genotypes of 1:2:1 (Figure 12.4). Furthermore, because the YY and Yy offspring have yellow seeds and are\nphenotypically identical, applying the sum rule of probability, we expect the offspring to exhibit a phenotypic ratio of 3 yellow:1\ngreen. Indeed, working with large sample sizes, Mendel observed approximately this ratio in every F2 generation resulting from\ncrosses for individual traits.\nMendel validated these results by performing an F3 cross in which he self-crossed the dominant- and recessive-expressing F2\nplants. When he self-crossed the plants expressing green seeds, all of the offspring had green seeds, confirming that all green\nseeds had homozygous genotypes of yy. When he self-crossed the F2 plants expressing yellow seeds, he found that one-third of\nthe plants bred true, and two-thirds of the plants segregated at a 3:1 ratio of yellow:green seeds. In this case, the true-breeding\nplants had homozygous (YY) genotypes, whereas the segregating plants corresponded to the heterozygous (Yy) genotype. When\nthese plants self-fertilized, the outcome was just like the F1 self-fertilizing cross.\nThe Test Cross Distinguishes the Dominant Phenotype\nBeyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents, Mendel also developed a way\nto determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote. Called the test cross,\n306\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthis technique is still used by plant and animal breeders. In a test cross, the dominant-expressing organism is crossed with an\norganism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic. If the dominant-expressing organism is a homozygote, then\nall F1 offspring will be heterozygotes expressing the dominant trait (Figure 12.5). Alternatively, if the dominant expressing\norganism is a heterozygote, the F1 offspring will exhibit a 1:1 ratio of heterozygotes and recessive homozygotes (Figure 12.5). The\ntest cross further validates Mendel\u2019s postulate that pairs of unit factors segregate equally.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 12.5 A test cross can be performed to determine whether an organism expressing a dominant trait is a homozygote or a\nheterozygote.\nIn pea plants, round peas (R) are dominant to wrinkled peas (r). You do a test cross between a pea plant with wrinkled peas\n(genotype rr) and a plant of unknown genotype that has round peas. You end up with three plants, all which have round peas.\nFrom this data, can you tell if the round pea parent plant is homozygous dominant or heterozygous? If the round pea parent\nplant is heterozygous, what is the probability that a random sample of 3 progeny peas will all be round?\nMany human diseases are genetically inherited. A healthy person in a family in which some members suffer from a recessive\ngenetic disorder may want to know if he or she has the disease-causing gene and what risk exists of passing the disorder on to\nhis or her offspring. Of course, doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical. Instead, geneticists use pedigree\nanalysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases (Figure 12.6).\n12.2 \u2022 Characteristics and Traits\n307\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 12.6 Alkaptonuria is a recessive genetic disorder in which two amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine, are not properly\nmetabolized. Affected individuals may have darkened skin and brown urine, and may suffer joint damage and other complications. In this\npedigree, individuals with the disorder are indicated in blue and have the genotype aa. Unaffected individuals are indicated in yellow and\nhave the genotype AA or Aa. Note that it is often possible to determine a person\u2019s genotype from the genotype of their offspring. For\nexample, if neither parent has the disorder but their child does, they must be heterozygous. Two individuals on the pedigree have an\nunaffected phenotype but unknown genotype. Because they do not have the disorder, they must have at least one normal allele, so their\ngenotype gets the \u201cA?\u201d designation.\nWhat are the genotypes of the individuals labeled 1, 2, and 3?\nAlternatives to Dominance and Recessiveness\nMendel\u2019s experiments with pea plants suggested that: (1) two \u201cunits\u201d or alleles exist for every gene; (2) alleles maintain their\nintegrity in each generation (no blending); and (3) in the presence of the dominant allele, the recessive allele is hidden and makes\nno contribution to the phenotype. Therefore, recessive alleles can be \u201ccarried\u201d and not expressed by individuals. Such\nheterozygous individuals are sometimes referred to as \u201ccarriers.\u201d Further genetic studies in other plants and animals have\nshown that much more complexity exists, but that the fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics still hold true. In the\nsections to follow, we consider some of the extensions of Mendelism. If Mendel had chosen an experimental system that\nexhibited these genetic complexities, it\u2019s possible that he would not have understood what his results meant.\nIncomplete Dominance\nMendel\u2019s results, that traits are inherited as dominant and recessive pairs, contradicted the view at that time that offspring\nexhibited a blend of their parents\u2019 traits. However, the heterozygote phenotype occasionally does appear to be intermediate\nbetween the two parents. For example, in the snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus (Figure 12.7), a cross between a homozygous\nparent with white flowers (CWCW) and a homozygous parent with red flowers (CRCR) will produce offspring with pink flowers\n(CRCW). (Note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for Mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from\nsimple dominance and recessiveness.) This pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance, denoting the\nexpression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype. The allele for red flowers is\nincompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers. However, the results of a heterozygote self-cross can still be predicted,\njust as with Mendelian dominant and recessive crosses. In this case, the genotypic ratio would be 1 CRCR:2 CRCW:1 CWCW, and\nthe phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1 for red:pink:white.\n308\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 12.7 These pink flowers of a heterozygote snapdragon result from incomplete dominance. (credit: \u201cstorebukkebruse\u201d/Flickr)\nCodominance\nA variation on incomplete dominance is codominance, in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously\nexpressed in the heterozygote. An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of humans. The M and N alleles are\nexpressed in the form of an M or N antigen present on the surface of red blood cells. Homozygotes (LMLM and LNLN) express\neither the M or the N allele, and heterozygotes (LMLN) express both alleles equally. In a self-cross between heterozygotes\nexpressing a codominant trait, the three possible offspring genotypes are phenotypically distinct. However, the 1:2:1 genotypic\nratio characteristic of a Mendelian monohybrid cross still applies.\nMultiple Alleles\nMendel implied that only two alleles, one dominant and one recessive, could exist for a given gene. We now know that this is an\noversimplification. Although individual humans (and all diploid organisms) can only have two alleles for a given gene, multiple\nalleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed. Note that when many alleles\nexist for the same gene, the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild\ntype (often abbreviated \u201c+\u201d); this is considered the standard or norm. All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants\nof this standard, meaning that they deviate from the wild type. The variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild-type allele.\nAn example of multiple alleles is coat color in rabbits (Figure 12.8). Here, four alleles exist for the c gene. The wild-type version,\nC+C+, is expressed as brown fur. The chinchilla phenotype, cchcch, is expressed as black-tipped white fur. The Himalayan\nphenotype, chch, has black fur on the extremities and white fur elsewhere. Finally, the albino, or \u201ccolorless\u201d phenotype, cc, is\nexpressed as white fur. In cases of multiple alleles, dominance hierarchies can exist. In this case, the wild-type allele is dominant\nover all the others, chinchilla is incompletely dominant over Himalayan and albino, and Himalayan is dominant over albino. This\nhierarchy, or allelic series, was revealed by observing the phenotypes of each possible heterozygote offspring.\n12.2 \u2022 Characteristics and Traits\n309\nFigure 12.8 Four different alleles exist for the rabbit coat color (C) gene.\nThe complete dominance of a wild-type phenotype over all other mutants often occurs as an effect of \u201cdosage\u201d of a specific gene\nproduct, such that the wild-type allele supplies the correct amount of gene product whereas the mutant alleles cannot. For the\nallelic series in rabbits, the wild-type allele may supply a given dosage of fur pigment, whereas the mutants supply a lesser\ndosage or none at all. Interestingly, the Himalayan phenotype is the result of an allele that produces a temperature-sensitive\ngene product that only produces pigment in the cooler extremities of the rabbit\u2019s body.\nAlternatively, one mutant allele can be dominant over all other phenotypes, including the wild type. This may occur when the\nmutant allele somehow interferes with the genetic message so that even a heterozygote with one wild-type allele copy expresses\nthe mutant phenotype. One way in which the mutant allele can interfere is by enhancing the function of the wild-type gene\nproduct or changing its distribution in the body. One example of this is the Antennapedia mutation in Drosophila (Figure 12.9).\nIn this case, the mutant allele expands the distribution of the gene product, and as a result, the Antennapedia heterozygote\ndevelops legs on its head where its antennae should be.\nFigure 12.9 As seen in comparing the wild-type Drosophila (left) and the Antennapedia mutant (right), the Antennapedia mutant has legs\non its head in place of antennae.\n310\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nMultiple Alleles Confer Drug Resistance in the Malaria Parasite\nMalaria is a parasitic disease in humans that is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, including Anopheles gambiae\n(Figure 12.10a), and is characterized by cyclic high fevers, chills, flu-like symptoms, and severe anemia. Plasmodium falciparum\nand P. vivax are the most common causative agents of malaria, and P. falciparum is the most deadly (Figure 12.10b). When\npromptly and correctly treated, P. falciparum malaria has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent. However, in some parts of the world,\nthe parasite has evolved resistance to commonly used malaria treatments, so the most effective malarial treatments can vary by\ngeographic region.\nFigure 12.10 The (a) Anopheles gambiae, or African malaria mosquito, acts as a vector in the transmission to humans of the malaria-\ncausing parasite (b) Plasmodium falciparum, here visualized using false-color transmission electron microscopy. (credit a: James D.\nGathany; credit b: Ute Frevert; false color by Margaret Shear; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nIn Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America, P. falciparum has developed resistance to the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine,\nmefloquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. P. falciparum, which is haploid during the life stage in which it is infectious to\nhumans, has evolved multiple drug-resistant mutant alleles of the dhps gene. Varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are\nassociated with each of these alleles. Being haploid, P. falciparum needs only one drug-resistant allele to express this trait.\nIn Southeast Asia, different sulfadoxine-resistant alleles of the dhps gene are localized to different geographic regions. This is a\ncommon evolutionary phenomenon that occurs because drug-resistant mutants arise in a population and interbreed with other\nP. falciparum isolates in close proximity. Sulfadoxine-resistant parasites cause considerable human hardship in regions where\nthis drug is widely used as an over-the-counter malaria remedy. As is common with pathogens that multiply to large numbers\nwithin an infection cycle, P. falciparum evolves relatively rapidly (over a decade or so) in response to the selective pressure of\ncommonly used anti-malarial drugs. For this reason, scientists must constantly work to develop new drugs or drug\ncombinations to combat the worldwide malaria burden.2\nX-Linked Traits\nIn humans, as well as in many other animals and some plants, the sex of the individual is determined by sex chromosomes. The\nsex chromosomes are one pair of non-homologous chromosomes. Until now, we have only considered inheritance patterns\namong non-sex chromosomes, or autosomes. In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, human females have a\nhomologous pair of X chromosomes, whereas human males have an XY chromosome pair. Although the Y chromosome contains\na small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis, the Y chromosome is much shorter and\ncontains many fewer genes. When a gene being examined is present on the X chromosome, but not on the Y chromosome, it is\nsaid to be X-linked.\nEye color in Drosophila was one of the first X-linked traits to be identified. Thomas Hunt Morgan mapped this trait to the X\nchromosome in 1910. Like humans, Drosophila males have an XY chromosome pair, and females are XX. In flies, the wild-type\neye color is red (XW) and it is dominant to white eye color (Xw) (Figure 12.11). Because of the location of the eye-color gene,\nreciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios. Males are said to be hemizygous, because they have only one allele\nfor any X-linked characteristic. Hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for XY males.\nDrosophila males lack a second allele copy on the Y chromosome; that is, their genotype can only be XWY or XwY. In contrast,\nfemales have two allele copies of this gene and can be XWXW, XWXw, or XwXw.\n2Sumiti Vinayak, et al., \u201cOrigin and Evolution of Sulfadoxine Resistant Plasmodium falciparum,\u201d Public Library of Science Pathogens 6, no. 3 (2010):\ne1000830, doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000830.\n12.2 \u2022 Characteristics and Traits\n311\nFigure 12.11 In Drosophila, several genes determine eye color. The genes for white and vermilion eye colors are located on the X\nchromosome. Others are located on the autosomes. Clockwise from top left are brown, cinnabar, sepia, vermilion, white, and red. Red eye\ncolor is wild-type and is dominant to white eye color.\nIn an X-linked cross, the genotypes of F1 and F2 offspring depend on whether the recessive trait was expressed by the male or the\nfemale in the P1 generation. With regard to Drosophila eye color, when the P1 male expresses the white-eye phenotype and the\nfemale is homozygous red-eyed, all members of the F1 generation exhibit red eyes (Figure 12.12). The F1 females are heterozygous\n(XWXw), and the males are all XWY, having received their X chromosome from the homozygous dominant P1 female and their Y\nchromosome from the P1 male. A subsequent cross between the XWXw female and the XWY male would produce only red-eyed\nfemales (with XWXW or XWXw genotypes) and both red- and white-eyed males (with XWY or XwY genotypes). Now, consider a\ncross between a homozygous white-eyed female and a male with red eyes. The F1 generation would exhibit only heterozygous\nred-eyed females (XWXw) and only white-eyed males (XwY). Half of the F2 females would be red-eyed (XWXw) and half would be\nwhite-eyed (XwXw). Similarly, half of the F2 males would be red-eyed (XWY) and half would be white-eyed (XwY).\n312\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 12.12 Punnett square analysis is used to determine the ratio of offspring from a cross between a red-eyed male fruit fly and a white-\neyed female fruit fly.\nWhat ratio of offspring would result from a cross between a white-eyed male and a female that is heterozygous for red eye color?\nDiscoveries in fruit fly genetics can be applied to human genetics. When a female parent is homozygous for a recessive X-linked\ntrait, she will pass the trait on to 100 percent of her offspring. Her male offspring are, therefore, destined to express the trait, as\nthey will inherit their father's Y chromosome. In humans, the alleles for certain conditions (some forms of color blindness,\nhemophilia, and muscular dystrophy) are X-linked. Females who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to be carriers and\nmay not exhibit any phenotypic effects. These females will pass the disease to half of their sons and will pass carrier status to half\nof their daughters; therefore, recessive X-linked traits appear more frequently in males than females.\nIn some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes, the sex with the non-homologous sex chromosomes is the female rather\nthan the male. This is the case for all birds. In this case, sex-linked traits will be more likely to appear in the female, in which they\nare hemizygous.\nHuman Sex-linked Disorders\nSex-linkage studies in Morgan\u2019s laboratory provided the fundamentals for understanding X-linked recessive disorders in\nhumans, which include red-green color blindness, and Types A and B hemophilia. Because human males need to inherit only\none recessive mutant X allele to be affected, X-linked disorders are disproportionately observed in males. Females must inherit\nrecessive X-linked alleles from both of their parents in order to express the trait. When they inherit one recessive X-linked\nmutant allele and one dominant X-linked wild-type allele, they are carriers of the trait and are typically unaffected. Carrier\nfemales can manifest mild forms of the trait due to the inactivation of the dominant allele located on one of the X chromosomes.\nHowever, female carriers can contribute the trait to their sons, resulting in the son exhibiting the trait, or they can contribute\nthe recessive allele to their daughters, resulting in the daughters being carriers of the trait (Figure 12.13). Although some Y-\nlinked recessive disorders exist, typically they are associated with infertility in males and are therefore not transmitted to\nsubsequent generations.\n12.2 \u2022 Characteristics and Traits\n313\nFigure 12.13 The son of a woman who is a carrier of a recessive X-linked disorder will have a 50 percent chance of being affected. A\ndaughter will not be affected, but she will have a 50 percent chance of being a carrier like her mother.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video to learn more about sex-linked traits.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/sex-linked_trts)\nLethality\nA large proportion of genes in an individual\u2019s genome are essential for survival. Occasionally, a nonfunctional allele for an\nessential gene can arise by mutation and be transmitted in a population as long as individuals with this allele also have a wild-\ntype, functional copy. The wild-type allele functions at a capacity sufficient to sustain life and is therefore considered to be\ndominant over the nonfunctional allele. However, consider two heterozygous parents that have a genotype of wild-type/\nnonfunctional mutant for a hypothetical essential gene. In one quarter of their offspring, we would expect to observe\nindividuals that are homozygous recessive for the nonfunctional allele. Because the gene is essential, these individuals might\nfail to develop past fertilization, die in utero, or die later in life, depending on what life stage requires this gene. An inheritance\npattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal or have some\naltered nonlethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal.\nFor crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous,\nonly wild-type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed. The genotypic ratio would therefore be 2:1. In other\ninstances, the recessive lethal allele might also exhibit a dominant (but not lethal) phenotype in the heterozygote. For instance,\nthe recessive lethal Curly allele in Drosophila affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote.\nA single copy of the wild-type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival. The dominant lethal\ninheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote; this allele can only be\ntransmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age. Individuals with mutations that result in dominant lethal\nalleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form. Dominant lethal alleles are very rare because, as you might expect, the allele\nonly lasts one generation and is not transmitted. However, just as the recessive lethal allele might not immediately manifest the\nphenotype of death, dominant lethal alleles also might not be expressed until adulthood. Once the individual reaches\nreproductive age, the allele may be unknowingly passed on, resulting in a delayed death in both generations. An example of this\n314\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nin humans is Huntington\u2019s disease, in which the nervous system gradually wastes away (Figure 12.14). People who are\nheterozygous for the dominant Huntington allele (Hh) will inevitably develop the fatal disease. However, the onset of\nHuntington\u2019s disease may not occur until age 40, at which point the afflicted persons may have already passed the allele to 50\npercent of their offspring.\nFigure 12.14 The neuron in the center of this micrograph (yellow) has nuclear inclusions characteristic of Huntington\u2019s disease (orange area\nin the center of the neuron). Huntington\u2019s disease occurs when an abnormal dominant allele for the Huntington gene is present.

As you have learned, more complex\nextensions of Mendelism exist that do not exhibit the same F2 phenotypic ratios (3:1). Nevertheless, these laws summarize the\nbasics of classical genetics.\nPairs of Unit Factors, or Genes\nMendel proposed first that paired unit factors of heredity were transmitted faithfully from generation to generation by the\ndissociation and reassociation of paired factors during gametogenesis and fertilization, respectively. After he crossed peas with\ncontrasting traits and found that the recessive trait resurfaced in the F2 generation, Mendel deduced that hereditary factors\nmust be inherited as discrete units. This finding contradicted the belief at that time that parental traits were blended in the\noffspring.\n12.3 \u2022 Laws of Inheritance\n315\nAlleles Can Be Dominant or Recessive\nMendel\u2019s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same\ncharacteristic. Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively. The\nrecessive allele will remain \u201clatent\u201d but will be transmitted to offspring by the same manner in which the dominant allele is\ntransmitted. The recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that have two copies of this allele (Figure 12.15), and these\noffspring will breed true when self-crossed.\nSince Mendel\u2019s experiments with pea plants, researchers have found that the law of dominance does not always hold true.\nInstead, several different patterns of inheritance have been found to exist.\nFigure 12.15 The child in the photo expresses albinism, a recessive trait.\nEqual Segregation of Alleles\nObserving that true-breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F1 generations that all expressed the dominant trait\nand F2 generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio, Mendel proposed the law of segregation. This\nlaw states that paired unit factors (genes) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of\ninheriting either factor. For the F2 generation of a monohybrid cross, the following three possible combinations of genotypes\ncould result: homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive. Because heterozygotes could arise from two\ndifferent pathways (receiving one dominant and one recessive allele from either parent), and because heterozygotes and\nhomozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically identical, the law supports Mendel\u2019s observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio. The\nequal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the Punnett square to accurately predict the offspring of parents with\nknown genotypes. The physical basis of Mendel\u2019s law of segregation is the first division of meiosis, in which the homologous\nchromosomes with their different versions of each gene are segregated into daughter nuclei. The role of the meiotic segregation\nof chromosomes in sexual reproduction was not understood by the scientific community during Mendel\u2019s lifetime.\nIndependent Assortment\nMendel\u2019s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into\ngametes, and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur. The independent assortment of genes\ncan be illustrated by the dihybrid cross, a cross between two true-breeding parents that express different traits for two\ncharacteristics. Consider the characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea plants, one that has green, wrinkled\nseeds (yyrr) and another that has yellow, round seeds (YYRR). Because each parent is homozygous, the law of segregation\nindicates that the gametes for the green/wrinkled plant all are yr, and the gametes for the yellow/round plant are all YR.\nTherefore, the F1 generation of offspring all are YyRr (Figure 12.16).\n316\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 12.16 This dihybrid cross of pea plants involves the genes for seed color and texture.\nIn pea plants, purple flowers (P) are dominant to white flowers (p) and yellow peas (Y) are dominant to green peas (y). What are\nthe possible genotypes and phenotypes for a cross between PpYY and ppYy pea plants? How many squares do you need to do a\nPunnett square analysis of this cross?\nFor the F2 generation, the law of segregation requires that each gamete receive either an R allele or an r allele along with either a\nY allele or a y allele. The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which an r allele sorted would be equally likely\nto contain either a Y allele or a y allele. Thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed when the YyRr heterozygote\nis self-crossed, as follows: YR, Yr, yR, and yr. Arranging these gametes along the top and left of a 4 \u00d7 4 Punnett square (Figure\n12.16) gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations. From these genotypes, we infer a phenotypic ratio of 9 round/yellow:3\nround/green:3 wrinkled/yellow:1 wrinkled/green (Figure 12.16). These are the offspring ratios we would expect, assuming we\nperformed the crosses with a large enough sample size.\nBecause of independent assortment and dominance, the 9:3:3:1 dihybrid phenotypic ratio can be collapsed into two 3:1 ratios,\ncharacteristic of any monohybrid cross that follows a dominant and recessive pattern. Ignoring seed color and considering only\nseed texture in the above dihybrid cross, we would expect that three quarters of the F2 generation offspring would be round, and\none quarter would be wrinkled. Similarly, isolating only seed color, we would assume that three quarters of the F2 offspring\nwould be yellow and one quarter would be green. The sorting of alleles for texture and color are independent events, so we can\napply the product rule. Therefore, the proportion of round and yellow F2 offspring is expected to be (3/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 9/16, and the\nproportion of wrinkled and green offspring is expected to be (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 1/16. These proportions are identical to those obtained\nusing a Punnett square. Round, green and wrinkled, yellow offspring can also be calculated using the product rule, as each of\nthese genotypes includes one dominant and one recessive phenotype. Therefore, the proportion of each is calculated as (3/4) \u00d7 (1/\n4) = 3/16.\nThe law of independent assortment also indicates that a cross between yellow, wrinkled (YYrr) and green, round (yyRR) parents\nwould yield the same F1 and F2 offspring as in the YYRR x yyrr cross.\nThe physical basis for the law of independent assortment also lies in meiosis I, in which the different homologous pairs line up\nin random orientations. Each gamete can contain any combination of paternal and maternal chromosomes (and therefore the\ngenes on them) because the orientation of tetrads on the metaphase plane is random.\n12.3 \u2022 Laws of Inheritance\n317\nForked-Line Method\nWhen more than two genes are being considered, the Punnett-square method becomes unwieldy. For instance, examining a\ncross involving four genes would require a 16 \u00d7 16 grid containing 256 boxes. It would be extremely cumbersome to manually\nenter each genotype. For more complex crosses, the forked-line and probability methods are preferred.\nTo prepare a forked-line diagram for a cross between F1 heterozygotes resulting from a cross between AABBCC and aabbcc\nparents, we first create rows equal to the number of genes being considered, and then segregate the alleles in each row on forked\nlines according to the probabilities for individual monohybrid crosses (Figure 12.17). We then multiply the values along each\nforked path to obtain the F2 offspring probabilities. Note that this process is a diagrammatic version of the product rule. The\nvalues along each forked pathway can be multiplied because each gene assorts independently. For a trihybrid cross, the F2\nphenotypic ratio is 27:9:9:9:3:3:3:1.\nFigure 12.17 The forked-line method can be used to analyze a trihybrid cross. Here, the probability for color in the F2 generation occupies\nthe top row (3 yellow:1 green). The probability for shape occupies the second row (3 round: 1 wrinkled), and the probability for height\noccupies the third row (3 tall:1 dwarf). The probability for each possible combination of traits is calculated by multiplying the probability for\neach individual trait. Thus, the probability of F2 offspring having yellow, round, and tall traits is 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3, or 27.\nProbability Method\nWhile the forked-line method is a diagrammatic approach to keeping track of probabilities in a cross, the probability method\ngives the proportions of offspring expected to exhibit each phenotype (or genotype) without the added visual assistance. Both\nmethods make use of the product rule and consider the alleles for each gene separately. Earlier, we examined the phenotypic\nproportions for a trihybrid cross using the forked-line method; now we will use the probability method to examine the genotypic\nproportions for a cross with even more genes.\nFor a trihybrid cross, writing out the forked-line method is tedious, albeit not as tedious as using the Punnett-square method.\nTo fully demonstrate the power of the probability method, however, we can consider specific genetic calculations. For instance,\nfor a tetrahybrid cross between individuals that are heterozygotes for all four genes, and in which all four genes are sorting\nindependently and in a dominant and recessive pattern, what proportion of the offspring will be expected to be homozygous\nrecessive for all four alleles? Rather than writing out every possible genotype, we can use the probability method. We know that\nfor each gene, the fraction of homozygous recessive offspring will be 1/4. Therefore, multiplying this fraction for each of the four\ngenes, (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4), we determine that 1/256 of the offspring will be quadruply homozygous recessive.\nFor the same tetrahybrid cross, what is the expected proportion of offspring that have the dominant phenotype at all four loci?\nWe can answer this question using phenotypic proportions, but let\u2019s do it the hard way\u2014using genotypic proportions. The\nquestion asks for the proportion of offspring that are 1) homozygous dominant at A or heterozygous at A, and 2) homozygous at\nB or heterozygous at B, and so on. Noting the \u201cor\u201d and \u201cand\u201d in each circumstance makes clear where to apply the sum and\nproduct rules. The probability of a homozygous dominant at A is 1/4 and the probability of a heterozygote at A is 1/2. The\nprobability of the homozygote or the heterozygote is 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 using the sum rule. The same probability can be obtained in\nthe same way for each of the other genes, so that the probability of a dominant phenotype at A and B and C and D is, using the\nproduct rule, equal to 3/4 \u00d7 3/4 \u00d7 3/4 \u00d7 3/4, or 81/256. If you are ever unsure about how to combine probabilities, returning to the\nforked-line method should make it clear.\nRules for Multihybrid Fertilization\nPredicting the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from given crosses is the best way to test your knowledge of Mendelian\n318\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ngenetics. Given a multihybrid cross that obeys independent assortment and follows a dominant and recessive pattern, several\ngeneralized rules exist; you can use these rules to check your results as you work through genetics calculations (Table 12.5). To\napply these rules, first you must determine n, the number of heterozygous gene pairs (the number of genes segregating two\nalleles each). For example, a cross between AaBb and AaBb heterozygotes has an n of 2. In contrast, a cross between AABb and\nAABb has an n of 1 because A is not heterozygous.\nGeneral Rules for Multihybrid Crosses\nGeneral Rule\nNumber of Heterozygous Gene\nPairs\nNumber of different F1 gametes\n2n\nNumber of different F2 genotypes\n3n\nGiven dominant and recessive inheritance, the number of different F2\nphenotypes\n2n\nTable 12.5\nLinked Genes Violate the Law of Independent Assortment\nAlthough all of Mendel\u2019s pea characteristics behaved according to the law of independent assortment, we now know that some\nallele combinations are not inherited independently of each other. Genes that are located on separate non-homologous\nchromosomes will always sort independently. However, each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes, organized\nlinearly on chromosomes like beads on a string. The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage, in which\ngenes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair. However,\nbecause of the process of recombination, or \u201ccrossover,\u201d it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave\nindependently, or as if they are not linked. To understand this, let\u2019s consider the biological basis of gene linkage and\nrecombination.\nHomologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same linear order. The alleles may differ on homologous chromosome\npairs, but the genes to which they correspond do not. In preparation for the first division of meiosis, homologous chromosomes\nreplicate and synapse. Like genes on the homologs align with each other. At this stage, segments of homologous chromosomes\nexchange linear segments of genetic material (Figure 12.18). This process is called recombination, or crossover, and it is a\ncommon genetic process. Because the genes are aligned during recombination, the gene order is not altered. Instead, the result\nof recombination is that maternal and paternal alleles are combined onto the same chromosome. Across a given chromosome,\nseveral recombination events may occur, causing extensive shuffling of alleles.\n12.3 \u2022 Laws of Inheritance\n319\nFigure 12.18 The process of crossover, or recombination, occurs when two homologous chromosomes align during meiosis and exchange a\nsegment of genetic material. Here, the alleles for gene C were exchanged. The result is two recombinant and two non-recombinant\nchromosomes.\nWhen two genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, they are considered linked, and their alleles tend to be\ntransmitted through meiosis together. To exemplify this, imagine a dihybrid cross involving flower color and plant height in\nwhich the genes are next to each other on the chromosome. If one homologous chromosome has alleles for tall plants and red\nflowers, and the other chromosome has genes for short plants and yellow flowers, then when the gametes are formed, the tall\nand red alleles will go together into a gamete and the short and yellow alleles will go into other gametes. These are called the\nparental genotypes because they have been inherited intact from the parents of the individual producing gametes. But unlike if\nthe genes were on different chromosomes, there will be no gametes with tall and yellow alleles and no gametes with short and\nred alleles. If you create the Punnett square with these gametes, you will see that the classical Mendelian prediction of a 9:3:3:1\noutcome of a dihybrid cross would not apply. As the distance between two genes increases, the probability of one or more\ncrossovers between them increases, and the genes behave more like they are on separate chromosomes. Geneticists have used\nthe proportion of recombinant gametes (the ones not like the parents) as a measure of how far apart genes are on a\nchromosome. Using this information, they have constructed elaborate maps of genes on chromosomes for well-studied\norganisms, including humans.\nMendel\u2019s seminal publication makes no mention of linkage, and many researchers have questioned whether he encountered\nlinkage but chose not to publish those crosses out of concern that they would invalidate his independent assortment postulate.\nThe garden pea has seven chromosomes, and some have suggested that his choice of seven characteristics was not a coincidence.\nHowever, even if the genes he examined were not located on separate chromosomes, it is possible that he simply did not observe\nlinkage because of the extensive shuffling effects of recombination.\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION\nTesting the Hypothesis of Independent Assortment\nTo better appreciate the amount of labor and ingenuity that went into Mendel\u2019s experiments, proceed through one of Mendel\u2019s\n320\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ndihybrid crosses.\nQuestion: What will be the offspring of a dihybrid cross?\nBackground: Consider that pea plants mature in one growing season, and you have access to a large garden in which you can\ncultivate thousands of pea plants. There are several true-breeding plants with the following pairs of traits: tall plants with\ninflated pods, and dwarf plants with constricted pods. Before the plants have matured, you remove the pollen-producing organs\nfrom the tall/inflated plants in your crosses to prevent self-fertilization. Upon plant maturation, the plants are manually crossed\nby transferring pollen from the dwarf/constricted plants to the stigmata of the tall/inflated plants.\nHypothesis: Both trait pairs will sort independently according to Mendelian laws. When the true-breeding parents are crossed,\nall of the F1 offspring are tall and have inflated pods, which indicates that the tall and inflated traits are dominant over the dwarf\nand constricted traits, respectively. A self-cross of the F1 heterozygotes results in 2,000 F2 progeny.\nTest the hypothesis: Because each trait pair sorts independently, the ratios of tall:dwarf and inflated:constricted are each\nexpected to be 3:1. The tall/dwarf trait pair is called T/t, and the inflated/constricted trait pair is designated I/i. Each member of\nthe F1 generation therefore has a genotype of TtIi. Construct a grid analogous to Figure 12.16, in which you cross two TtIi\nindividuals. Each individual can donate four combinations of two traits: TI, Ti, tI, or ti, meaning that there are 16 possibilities of\noffspring genotypes. Because the T and I alleles are dominant, any individual having one or two of those alleles will express the\ntall or inflated phenotypes, respectively, regardless if they also have a t or i allele. Only individuals that are tt or ii will express the\ndwarf and constricted alleles, respectively. As shown in Figure 12.19, you predict that you will observe the following offspring\nproportions: tall/inflated:tall/constricted:dwarf/inflated:dwarf/constricted in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Notice from the grid that when\nconsidering the tall/dwarf and inflated/constricted trait pairs in isolation, they are each inherited in 3:1 ratios.\nFigure 12.19 This figure shows all possible combinations of offspring resulting from a dihybrid cross of pea plants that are heterozygous for\nthe tall/dwarf and inflated/constricted alleles.\nTest the hypothesis: You cross the dwarf and tall plants and then self-cross the offspring. For best results, this is repeated with\nhundreds or even thousands of pea plants. What special precautions should be taken in the crosses and in growing the plants?\nAnalyze your data: You observe the following plant phenotypes in the F2 generation: 2706 tall/inflated, 930 tall/constricted, 888\ndwarf/inflated, and 300 dwarf/constricted. Reduce these findings to a ratio and determine if they are consistent with Mendelian\nlaws.\nForm a conclusion: Were the results close to the expected 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio? Do the results support the prediction? What\nmight be observed if far fewer plants were used, given that alleles segregate randomly into gametes? Try to imagine growing\nthat many pea plants, and consider the potential for experimental error. For instance, what would happen if it was extremely\nwindy one day?\n12.3 \u2022 Laws of Inheritance\n321\nEpistasis\nMendel\u2019s studies in pea plants implied that the sum of an individual\u2019s phenotype was controlled by genes (or as he called them,\nunit factors), such that every characteristic was distinctly and completely controlled by a single gene. In fact, single observable\ncharacteristics are almost always under the influence of multiple genes (each with two or more alleles) acting in unison. For\nexample, at least eight genes contribute to eye color in humans.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nEye color in humans is determined by multiple genes. Use the Eye Color Calculator (http://openstax.org/l/eye_color_calc) to\npredict the eye color of children from parental eye color.\nIn some cases, several genes can contribute to aspects of a common phenotype without their gene products ever directly\ninteracting. In the case of organ development, for instance, genes may be expressed sequentially, with each gene adding to the\ncomplexity and specificity of the organ. Genes may function in complementary or synergistic fashions, such that two or more\ngenes need to be expressed simultaneously to affect a phenotype. Genes may also oppose each other, with one gene modifying\nthe expression of another.\nIn epistasis, the interaction between genes is antagonistic, such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of\nanother. \u201cEpistasis\u201d is a word composed of Greek roots that mean \u201cstanding upon.\u201d The alleles that are being masked or silenced\nare said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking. Often the biochemical basis of epistasis is a gene\npathway in which the expression of one gene is dependent on the function of a gene that precedes or follows it in the pathway.\nAn example of epistasis is pigmentation in mice. The wild-type coat color, agouti (AA), is dominant to solid-colored fur (aa).\nHowever, a separate gene (C) is necessary for pigment production. A mouse with a recessive c allele at this locus is unable to\nproduce pigment and is albino regardless of the allele present at locus A (Figure 12.20). Therefore, the genotypes AAcc, Aacc, and\naacc all produce the same albino phenotype. A cross between heterozygotes for both genes (AaCc x AaCc) would generate\noffspring with a phenotypic ratio of 9 agouti:3 solid color:4 albino (Figure 12.20). In this case, the C gene is epistatic to the A\ngene.\n322\nChapter 12 \u2022 Mendel's Experiments and Heredity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 12.20 In mice, the mottled agouti coat color (A) is dominant to a solid coloration, such as black or gray. A gene at a separate locus\n(C) is responsible for pigment production. The recessive c allele does not produce pigment, and a mouse with the homozygous recessive cc\ngenotype is albino regardless of the allele present at the A locus. Thus, the C gene is epistatic to the A gene.\nEpistasis can also occur when a dominant allele masks expression at a separate gene. Fruit color in summer squash is expressed\nin this way. Homozygous recessive expression of the W gene (ww) coupled with homozygous dominant or heterozygous\nexpression of the Y gene (YY or Yy) generates yellow fruit, and the wwyy genotype produces green fruit. However, if a dominant\ncopy of the W gene is present in the homozygous or heterozygous form, the summer squash will produce white fruit regardless\nof the Y alleles. A cross between white heterozygotes for both genes (WwYy \u00d7 WwYy) would produce offspring with a phenotypic\nratio of 12 white:3 yellow:1 green.\nFinally, epistasis can be reciprocal such that either gene, when present in the dominant (or recessive) form, expresses the same\nphenotype. In the shepherd\u2019s purse plant (Capsella bursa-pastoris), the characteristic of seed shape is controlled by two genes in\na dominant epistatic relationship. When the genes A and B are both homozygous recessive (aabb), the seeds are ovoid. If the\ndominant allele for either of these genes is present, the result is triangular seeds. That is, every possible genotype other than\naabb results in triangular seeds, and a cross between heterozygotes for both genes (AaBb x AaBb) would yield offspring with a\nphenotypic ratio of 15 triangular:1 ovoid.\nAs you work through genetics problems, keep in mind that any single characteristic that results in a phenotypic ratio that totals\n16 is typical of a two-gene interaction. Recall the phenotypic inheritance pattern for Mendel\u2019s dihybrid cross, which considered\ntwo noninteracting genes\u20149:3:3:1. Similarly, we would expect interacting gene pairs to also exhibit ratios expressed as 16 parts.\nNote that we are assuming the interacting genes are not linked; they are still assorting independently into gametes.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor an excellent review of Mendel\u2019s experiments and to perform your own crosses and identify patterns of inheritance, visit the\nMendel\u2019s Peas (http://openstax.org/l/mendels_peas) web lab.\n12.3 \u2022 Laws of Inheritance\n323\n", "key_terms": "\nallele\ngene variations that arise by mutation and exist at\nthe same relative locations on homologous chromosomes\nautosomes\nany of the non-sex chromosomes\nblending theory of inheritance\nhypothetical inheritance\npattern in which parental traits are blended together in\nthe offspring to produce an intermediate physical\nappearance\ncodominance\nin a heterozygote, complete and\nsimultaneous expression of both alleles for the same\ncharacteristic\ncontinuous variation\ninheritance pattern in which a\ncharacter shows a range of trait values with small\ngradations rather than large gaps between them\ndihybrid\nresult of a cross between two true-breeding\nparents that express different traits for two\ncharacteristics\ndiscontinuous variation\ninheritance pattern in which traits\nare distinct and are transmitted independently of one\nanother\ndominant\ntrait which confers the same physical\nappearance whether an individual has two copies of the\ntrait or one copy of the dominant trait and one copy of the\nrecessive trait\ndominant lethal\ninheritance pattern in which an allele is\nlethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote;

When the\noffspring in Mendel\u2019s experiment were self-crossed, the F2\noffspring exhibited the dominant trait or the recessive trait\nin a 3:1 ratio, confirming that the recessive trait had been\ntransmitted faithfully from the original P0 parent. Reciprocal\ncrosses generated identical F1 and F2 offspring ratios. By\nexamining sample sizes, Mendel showed that his crosses\nbehaved reproducibly according to the laws of probability,\nand that the traits were inherited as independent events.\nTwo rules in probability can be used to find the expected\nproportions of offspring of different traits from different\ncrosses. To find the probability of two or more independent\nevents occurring together, apply the product rule and\nmultiply the probabilities of the individual events. The use of\nthe word \u201cand\u201d suggests the appropriate application of the\nproduct rule. To find the probability of two or more events\noccurring in combination, apply the sum rule and add their\nindividual probabilities together. The use of the word \u201cor\u201d\nsuggests the appropriate application of the sum rule.\n12.2 Characteristics and Traits\nWhen true-breeding or homozygous individuals that differ\nfor a certain trait are crossed, all of the offspring will be\nheterozygotes for that trait. If the traits are inherited as\ndominant and recessive, the F1 offspring will all exhibit the\nsame phenotype as the parent homozygous for the dominant\ntrait. If these heterozygous offspring are self-crossed, the\nresulting F2 offspring will be equally likely to inherit gametes\ncarrying the dominant or recessive trait, giving rise to\noffspring of which one quarter are homozygous dominant,\nhalf are heterozygous, and one quarter are homozygous\nrecessive. Because homozygous dominant and heterozygous\nindividuals are phenotypically identical, the observed traits\nin the F2 offspring will exhibit a ratio of three dominant to\none recessive.\nAlleles do not always behave in dominant and recessive\npatterns. Incomplete dominance describes situations in\nwhich the heterozygote exhibits a phenotype that is\nintermediate between the homozygous phenotypes.\nCodominance describes the simultaneous expression of both\nof the alleles in the heterozygote. Although diploid\norganisms can only have two alleles for any given gene, it is\ncommon for more than two alleles of a gene to exist in a\npopulation. In humans, as in many animals and some plants,\nfemales have two X chromosomes and males have one X and\none Y chromosome. Genes that are present on the X but not\nthe Y chromosome are said to be X-linked, such that males\nonly inherit one allele for the gene, and females inherit two.\nFinally, some alleles can be lethal. Recessive lethal alleles are\nonly lethal in homozygotes, but dominant lethal alleles are\nfatal in heterozygotes as well.\n12.3 Laws of Inheritance\nMendel postulated that genes (characteristics) are inherited\nas pairs of alleles (traits) that behave in a dominant and\nrecessive pattern. Alleles segregate into gametes such that\neach gamete is equally likely to receive either one of the two\nalleles present in a diploid individual. In addition, genes are\nassorted into gametes independently of one another. That is,\nalleles are generally not more likely to segregate into a\ngamete with a particular allele of another gene. A dihybrid\ncross demonstrates independent assortment when the genes\nin question are on different chromosomes or distant from\neach other on the same chromosome. For crosses involving\nmore than two genes, use the forked line or probability\nmethods to predict offspring genotypes and phenotypes\nrather than a Punnett square.\nAlthough chromosomes sort independently into gametes\nduring meiosis, Mendel\u2019s law of independent assortment\nrefers to genes, not chromosomes, and a single chromosome\nmay carry more than 1,000 genes. When genes are located in\nclose proximity on the same chromosome, their alleles tend\nto be inherited together. This results in offspring ratios that\nviolate Mendel's law of independent assortment. However,\nrecombination serves to exchange genetic material on\nhomologous chromosomes such that maternal and paternal\nalleles may be recombined on the same chromosome. This is\nwhy alleles on a given chromosome are not always inherited\ntogether. Recombination is a random event occurring\nanywhere on a chromosome. Therefore, genes that are far\napart on the same chromosome are likely to still assort\nindependently because of recombination events that\noccurred in the intervening chromosomal space.\nWhether or not they are sorting independently, genes may\ninteract at the level of gene products such that the expression\nof an allele for one gene masks or modifies the expression of\nan allele for a different gene. This is called epistasis.\nChapter 12 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n325\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1. Figure 12.5 In pea plants, round peas (R) are dominant to\nwrinkled peas (r).

Chromosome behavior and interaction during meiosis explain, at a cellular level,\ninheritance patterns that we observe in populations.

With improved microscopic techniques during the late 1800s, cell\nbiologists could stain and visualize subcellular structures with dyes and observe their actions during cell\ndivision and meiosis. With each mitotic division, chromosomes replicated, condensed from an amorphous\n(no constant shape) nuclear mass into distinct X-shaped bodies (pairs of identical sister chromatids), and\nmigrated to separate cellular poles.\nChromosomal Theory of Inheritance\nThe speculation that chromosomes might be the key to understanding heredity led several scientists to\nexamine Mendel\u2019s publications and reevaluate his model in terms of chromosome behavior during mitosis\nand meiosis. In 1902, Theodor Boveri observed that proper sea urchin embryonic development does not\noccur unless chromosomes are present. That same year, Walter Sutton observed chromosome separation\ninto daughter cells during meiosis (Figure 13.2). Together, these observations led to the Chromosomal\nTheory of Inheritance, which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian\ninheritance.\nFigure 13.2 (a) Walter Sutton and (b) Theodor Boveri developed the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which states\nthat chromosomes carry the unit of heredity (genes).\nThe Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was consistent with Mendel\u2019s laws, which the following\nobservations supported:\n\u2022\nDuring meiosis, homologous chromosome pairs migrate as discrete structures that are independent of\nother chromosome pairs.\n\u2022\nChromosome sorting from each homologous pair into pre-gametes appears to be random.\n\u2022\nEach parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half their chromosomal complement.\n\u2022\nEven though male and female gametes (sperm and egg) differ in size and morphology, they have the\nsame number of chromosomes, suggesting equal genetic contributions from each parent.\n\u2022\nThe gametic chromosomes combine during fertilization to produce offspring with the same\nchromosome number as their parents.\nDespite compelling correlations between chromosome behavior during meiosis and Mendel\u2019s abstract laws,\n330\nChapter 13 \u2022 Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nscientists proposed the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance long before there was any direct evidence that chromosomes\ncarried traits. Critics pointed out that individuals had far more independently segregating traits than they had chromosomes. It\nwas only after several years of carrying out crosses with the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, that Thomas Hunt Morgan\nprovided experimental evidence to support the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance.\nGenetic Linkage and Distances\nMendel\u2019s work suggested that traits are inherited independently of each other. Morgan identified a 1:1 correspondence between\na segregating trait and the X chromosome, suggesting that random chromosome segregation was the physical basis of Mendel\u2019s\nmodel. This also demonstrated that linked genes disrupt Mendel\u2019s predicted outcomes. That each chromosome can carry many\nlinked genes explains how individuals can have many more traits than they have chromosomes. However, researchers in\nMorgan\u2019s laboratory suggested that alleles positioned on the same chromosome were not always inherited together. During\nmeiosis, linked genes somehow became unlinked.\nHomologous Recombination\nIn 1909, Frans Janssen observed chiasmata\u2014the point at which chromatids are in contact with each other and may exchange\nsegments\u2014prior to the first meiosis division. He suggested that alleles become unlinked and chromosomes physically exchange\nsegments. As chromosomes condensed and paired with their homologs, they appeared to interact at distinct points. Janssen\nsuggested that these points corresponded to regions in which chromosome segments exchanged. We now know that the pairing\nand interaction between homologous chromosomes, or synapsis, does more than simply organize the homologs for migration\nto separate daughter cells. When synapsed, homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in\nhomologous recombination, or more simply, \u201ccrossing over.\u201d\nTo better understand the type of experimental results that researchers were obtaining at this time, consider a heterozygous\nindividual that inherited dominant maternal alleles for two genes on the same chromosome (such as AB) and two recessive\npaternal alleles for those same genes (such as ab). If the genes are linked, one would expect this individual to produce gametes\nthat are either AB or ab with a 1:1 ratio. If the genes are unlinked, the individual should produce AB, Ab, aB, and ab gametes with\nequal frequencies, according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment. Because they correspond to new allele\ncombinations, the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis.\nParental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents. Morgan and his colleagues, however,\nfound that when they test crossed such heterozygous individuals to a homozygous recessive parent (AaBb \u00d7 aabb), both parental\nand nonparental cases occurred. For example, 950 offspring might be recovered that were either AaBb or aabb, but 50 offspring\nwould also result that were either Aabb or aaBb. These results suggested that linkage occurred most often, but a significant\nminority of offspring were the products of recombination.\n13.1 \u2022 Chromosomal Theory and Genetic Linkage\n331\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 13.3 This figure shows unlinked and linked gene inheritance patterns. In (a), two genes are located on different chromosomes so\nindependent assortment occurs during meiosis. The offspring have an equal chance of being the parental type (inheriting the same\ncombination of traits as the parents) or a nonparental type (inheriting a different combination of traits than the parents). In (b), two genes\nare very close together on the same chromosome so that no crossing over occurs between them. Therefore, the genes are always inherited\ntogether and all the offspring are the parental type. In (c), two genes are far apart on the chromosome such that crossing over occurs during\n332\nChapter 13 \u2022 Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nevery meiotic event. The recombination frequency will be the same as if the genes were on separate chromosomes. (d) The actual\nrecombination frequency of fruit fly wing length and body color that Thomas Morgan observed in 1912 was 17 percent. A crossover\nfrequency between 0 percent and 50 percent indicates that the genes are on the same chromosome and crossover sometimes occurs.\nIn a test cross for two characteristics such as the one here, can the recombinant offspring's predicted frequency be 60 percent?\nWhy or why not?\nGenetic Maps\nJanssen did not have the technology to demonstrate crossing over so it remained an abstract idea that scientists did not widely\nbelieve. Scientists thought chiasmata were a variation on synapsis and could not understand how chromosomes could break and\nrejoin. Yet, the data were clear that linkage did not always occur. Ultimately, it took a young undergraduate student and an \u201call-\nnighter\u201d to mathematically elucidate the linkage and recombination problem.\nIn 1913, Alfred Sturtevant, a student in Morgan\u2019s laboratory, gathered results from researchers in the laboratory, and took them\nhome one night to mull them over. By the next morning, he had created the first \u201cchromosome map,\u201d a linear representation of\ngene order and relative distance on a chromosome (Figure 13.4).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 13.4 This genetic map orders Drosophila genes on the basis of recombination frequency.\nWhich of the following statements is true?\na.\nRecombination of the body color and red/cinnabar eye alleles will occur more frequently than recombination of the alleles\nfor wing length and aristae length.\nb.\nRecombination of the body color and aristae length alleles will occur more frequently than recombination of red/brown eye\nalleles and the aristae length alleles.\nc.\nRecombination of the gray/black body color and long/short aristae alleles will not occur.\nd.\nRecombination of the red/brown eye and long/short aristae alleles will occur more frequently than recombination of the\nalleles for wing length and body color.\nAs Figure 13.4 shows, by using recombination frequency to predict genetic distance, we can infer the relative gene order on\nchromosome 2. The values represent map distances in centimorgans (cM), which correspond to recombination frequencies (in\npercent). Therefore, the genes for body color and wing size were 65.5 \u2212 48.5 = 17 cM apart, indicating that the maternal and\npaternal alleles for these genes recombine in 17 percent of offspring, on average.\nTo construct a chromosome map, Sturtevant assumed that genes were ordered serially on threadlike chromosomes. He also\nassumed that the incidence of recombination between two homologous chromosomes could occur with equal likelihood\nanywhere along the chromosome's length. Operating under these assumptions, Sturtevant postulated that alleles that were far\napart on a chromosome were more likely to dissociate during meiosis simply because there was a larger region over which\nrecombination could occur. Conversely, alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited\n13.1 \u2022 Chromosomal Theory and Genetic Linkage\n333\ntogether. The average number of crossovers between two alleles\u2014that is, their recombination frequency\u2014correlated with their\ngenetic distance from each other, relative to the locations of other genes on that chromosome. Considering the example cross\nbetween AaBb and aabb above, we could calculate the recombination's frequency as 50/1000 = 0.05. That is, the likelihood of a\ncrossover between genes A/a and B/b was 0.05, or 5 percent. Such a result would indicate that the genes were definitively linked,\nbut that they were far enough apart for crossovers to occasionally occur. Sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units, or\ncentimorgans (cM), in which a 0,01 recombination frequency corresponds to 1 cM.\nBy representing alleles in a linear map, Sturtevant suggested that genes can range from linking perfectly (recombination\nfrequency = 0) to unlinking perfectly (recombination frequency = 0.5) when genes are on different chromosomes or genes\nseparate very far apart on the same chromosome. Perfectly unlinked genes correspond to the frequencies Mendel predicted to\nassort independently in a dihybrid cross. A 0.5 recombination frequency indicates that 50 percent of offspring are recombinants\nand the other 50 percent are parental types. That is, every type of allele combination is represented with equal frequency. This\nrepresentation allowed Sturtevant to additively calculate distances between several genes on the same chromosome. However,\nas the genetic distances approached 0.50, his predictions became less accurate because it was not clear whether the genes were\nvery far apart on the same or on different chromosomes.\nIn 1931, Barbara McClintock and Harriet Creighton demonstrated the crossover of homologous chromosomes in corn plants.\nWeeks later, Curt Stern demonstrated microscopically homologous recombination in Drosophila. Stern observed several X-\nlinked phenotypes that were associated with a structurally unusual and dissimilar X chromosome pair in which one X was\nmissing a small terminal segment, and the other X was fused to a piece of the Y chromosome. By crossing flies, observing their\noffspring, and then visualizing the offspring\u2019s chromosomes, Stern demonstrated that every time the offspring allele\ncombination deviated from either of the parental combinations, there was a corresponding exchange of an X chromosome\nsegment. Using mutant flies with structurally distinct X chromosomes was the key to observing the products of recombination\nbecause DNA sequencing and other molecular tools were not yet available. We now know that homologous chromosomes\nregularly exchange segments in meiosis by reciprocally breaking and rejoining their DNA at precise locations.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReview Sturtevant\u2019s process to create a genetic map on the basis of recombination frequencies here (http://openstax.org/l/\ngene_crossover) .\nMendel\u2019s Mapped Traits\nHomologous recombination is a common genetic process, yet Mendel never observed it. Had he investigated both linked and\nunlinked genes, it would have been much more difficult for him to create a unified model of his data on the basis of probabilistic\ncalculations. Researchers who have since mapped the seven traits that Mendel investigated onto a pea plant genome's seven\nchromosomes have confirmed that all the genes he examined are either on separate chromosomes or are sufficiently far apart as\nto be statistically unlinked. Some have suggested that Mendel was enormously lucky to select only unlinked genes; whereas,\nothers question whether Mendel discarded any data suggesting linkage. In any case, Mendel consistently observed independent\nassortment because he examined genes that were effectively unlinked.\n13.2 Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe how a karyogram is created\n\u2022\nExplain how nondisjunction leads to disorders in chromosome number\n\u2022\nCompare disorders that aneuploidy causes\n\u2022\nDescribe how errors in chromosome structure occur through inversions and translocations\nInherited disorders can arise when chromosomes behave abnormally during meiosis. We can divide chromosome disorders into\ntwo categories: abnormalities in chromosome number and chromosomal structural rearrangements. Because even small\nchromosome segments can span many genes, chromosomal disorders are characteristically dramatic and often fatal.\nChromosome Identification\nChromosome isolation and microscopic observation forms the basis of cytogenetics and is the primary method by which\nclinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans. A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes, and\n334\nChapter 13 \u2022 Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nincludes their length, banding pattern, and centromere position. To obtain a view of an individual\u2019s karyotype, cytologists\nphotograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart, or karyogram. Another name is an\nideogram (Figure 13.5).\nFigure 13.5 This karyotype is of a female human. Notice that homologous chromosomes are the same size, and have the same centromere\npositions and banding patterns. A human male would have an XY chromosome pair instead of the XX pair. (credit: Andreas Blozer et al)\nIn a given species, we can identify chromosomes by their number, size, centromere position, and banding pattern. In a human\nkaryotype, autosomes or \u201cbody chromosomes\u201d (all of the non\u2013sex chromosomes) are generally organized in approximate order\nof size from largest (chromosome 1) to smallest (chromosome 22). The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes. However,\nchromosome 21 is actually shorter than chromosome 22. Researchers discovered this after naming Down syndrome as trisomy\n21, reflecting how this disease results from possessing one extra chromosome 21 (three total). Not wanting to change the name\nof this important disease, scientists retained the numbering of chromosome 21 despite describing it having the shortest set of\nchromosomes. We may designate the chromosome \u201carms\u201d projecting from either end of the centromere as short or long,\ndepending on their relative lengths. We abbreviate the short arm p (for \u201cpetite\u201d); whereas, we abbreviate the long arm q (because\nit follows \u201cp\u201d alphabetically). Numbers further subdivide and denote each arm. Using this naming system, we can describe\nchromosome locations consistently in the scientific literature.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nGeneticists Use Karyograms to Identify Chromosomal Aberrations\nAlthough we refer to Mendel as the \u201cfather of modern genetics,\u201d he performed his experiments with none of the tools that the\ngeneticists of today routinely employ. One such powerful cytological technique is karyotyping, a method in which geneticists\ncan identify traits characterized by chromosomal abnormalities from a single cell. To observe an individual\u2019s karyotype, a\ngeneticist first collects a person\u2019s cells (like white blood cells) from a blood sample or other tissue. In the laboratory, he or she\nstimulates the isolated cells to begin actively dividing. The geneticist then applies the chemical colchicine to cells to arrest\ncondensed chromosomes in metaphase. The geneticist then induces swelling in the cells using a hypotonic solution so the\nchromosomes spread apart. Finally, the geneticist preserves the sample in a fixative and applies it to a slide.\nThe geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better visualize each chromosome pair's distinct and\nreproducible banding patterns. Following staining, the geneticist views the chromosomes using bright-field microscopy. A\ncommon stain choice is the Giemsa stain. Giemsa staining results in approximately 400\u2013800 bands (of tightly coiled DNA and\ncondensed proteins) arranged along all 23 chromosome pairs. An experienced geneticist can identify each band. In addition to\nthe banding patterns, geneticists further identify chromosomes on the basis of size and centromere location. To obtain the\nclassic depiction of the karyotype in which homologous chromosome pairs align in numerical order from longest to shortest,\nthe geneticist obtains a digital image, identifies each chromosome, and manually arranges the chromosomes into this pattern\n(Figure 13.5).\nAt its most basic, the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which an individual has too many or too few chromosomes\nper cell. Examples of this are Down Syndrome, which one identifies by a third copy of chromosome 21, and Turner Syndrome,\nwhich has the presence of only one X chromosome in women instead of the normal two characterizes. Geneticists can also\nidentify large DNA deletions or insertions. For instance, geneticists can identify Jacobsen Syndrome\u2014which involves distinctive\nfacial features as well as heart and bleeding defects\u2014by a deletion on chromosome 11. Finally, the karyotype can pinpoint\ntranslocations, which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another\n13.2 \u2022 Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders\n335\nchromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome. Translocations are implicated in certain cancers, including chronic\nmyelogenous leukemia.\nDuring Mendel\u2019s lifetime, inheritance was an abstract concept that one could only infer by performing crosses and observing the\ntraits that offspring expressed. By observing a karyogram, today\u2019s geneticists can actually visualize an individual's\nchromosomal composition to confirm or predict genetic abnormalities in offspring, even before birth.\nChromosome Number Disorders\nOf all of the chromosomal disorders, chromosome number abnormalities are the most obviously identifiable from a karyogram.\nChromosome number disorders include duplicating or losing entire chromosomes, as well as changes in the number of\ncomplete sets of chromosomes. They are caused by nondisjunction, which occurs when homologous chromosome pairs or sister\nchromatids fail to separate during meiosis. Misaligned or incomplete synapsis, or a spindle apparatus dysfunction that\nfacilitates chromosome migration, can cause nondisjunction. The risk of nondisjunction occurring increases with the parents'\nage.\nNondisjunction can occur during either meiosis I or II, with differing results (Figure 13.6). If homologous chromosomes fail to\nseparate during meiosis I, the result is two gametes that lack that particular chromosome and two gametes with two\nchromosome copies. If sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis II, the result is one gamete that lacks that chromosome,\ntwo normal gametes with one chromosome copy, and one gamete with two chromosome copies.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 13.6 Nondisjunction occurs when homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis, resulting in an\nabnormal chromosome number.

In humans, euploidy\ncorresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. An individual with an error in chromosome number is\ndescribed as aneuploid, a term that includes monosomy (losing one chromosome) or trisomy (gaining an extraneous\nchromosome). Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they\nlack essential genes. This underscores the importance of \u201cgene dosage\u201d in humans. Most autosomal trisomies also fail to develop\nto birth; however, duplications of some smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring that survive for several\nweeks to many years. Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an excess in gene dose. Individuals\nwith an extra chromosome may synthesize an abundance of the gene products, which that chromosome encodes. This extra\ndose (150 percent) of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and often precludes development. The most\ncommon trisomy among viable births is that of chromosome 21, which corresponds to Down Syndrome. Short stature and\nstunted digits, facial distinctions that include a broad skull and large tongue, and significant developmental delays characterize\nindividuals with this inherited disorder. We can correlate the incidence of Down syndrome with maternal age. Older women are\nmore likely to become pregnant with fetuses carrying the trisomy 21 genotype (Figure 13.7).\nFigure 13.7 The incidence of having a fetus with trisomy 21 increases dramatically with maternal age.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisualize adding a chromosome that leads to Down syndrome in this video simulation (http://openstax.org/l/down_syndrome) .\nPolyploidy\nWe call an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) polyploid. For instance,\nfertilizing an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid animals are extremely\nrare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. Polyploid animals are sterile\nbecause meiosis cannot proceed normally and instead produces mostly aneuploid daughter cells that cannot yield viable\nzygotes. Rarely, polyploid animals can reproduce asexually by haplodiploidy, in which an unfertilized egg divides mitotically to\nproduce offspring. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and\nmore robust than euploids of their species (Figure 13.8).\n13.2 \u2022 Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders\n337\nFigure 13.8 As with many polyploid plants, this triploid orange daylily (Hemerocallis fulva) is particularly large and robust, and grows\nflowers with triple the number of petals of its diploid counterparts. (credit: Steve Karg)\nSex Chromosome Nondisjunction in Humans\nHumans display dramatic deleterious effects with autosomal trisomies and monosomies. Therefore, it may seem\ncounterintuitive that human females and males can function normally, despite carrying different numbers of the X\nchromosome. Rather than a gain or loss of autosomes, variations in the number of sex chromosomes occur with relatively mild\neffects. In part, this happens because of the molecular process X inactivation. Early in development, when female mammalian\nembryos consist of just a few thousand cells (relative to trillions in the newborn), one X chromosome in each cell inactivates by\ntightly condensing into a quiescent (dormant) structure, or a Barr body. The chance that an X chromosome (maternally or\npaternally derived) inactivates in each cell is random, but once this occurs, all cells derived from that one will have the same\ninactive X chromosome or Barr body. By this process, females compensate for their double genetic dose of X chromosome. In\nso-called \u201ctortoiseshell\u201d cats, we observe embryonic X inactivation as color variegation (Figure 13.9). Females that are\nheterozygous for an X-linked coat color gene will express one of two different coat colors over different regions of their body,\ncorresponding to whichever X chromosome inactivates in that region's embryonic cell progenitor.\nFigure 13.9 In cats, the gene for coat color is located on the X chromosome. In female cats' embryonic development, one of the two X\nchromosomes randomly inactivates in each cell, resulting in a tortoiseshell pattern if the cat has two different alleles for coat color. Male\ncats, having only one X chromosome, never exhibit a tortoiseshell coat color. (credit: Michael Bodega)\nAn individual carrying an abnormal number of X chromosomes will inactivate all but one X chromosome in each of her cells.\nHowever, even inactivated X chromosomes continue to express a few genes, and X chromosomes must reactivate for the proper\nmaturation of female ovaries. As a result, X-chromosomal abnormalities typically occur with mild mental and physical defects,\nas well as sterility. If the X chromosome is absent altogether, the individual will not develop in utero.\n338\nChapter 13 \u2022 Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nScientists have identified and characterized several errors in sex chromosome number. Individuals with three X chromosomes,\ntriplo-X, are phenotypically female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY genotype, corresponding to\none type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to phenotypically male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and\nreduced body hair. More complex types of Klinefelter syndrome exist in which the individual has as many as five X\nchromosomes. In all types, every X chromosome except one undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic\ndosage. We see this as several Barr bodies in each cell nucleus. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 genotype (i.e., only a\nsingle sex chromosome), corresponds to a phenotypically female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region,\nhearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility.\nDuplications and Deletions\nIn addition to losing or gaining an entire chromosome, a chromosomal segment may duplicate or lose itself. Duplications and\ndeletions often produce offspring that survive but exhibit physical and mental abnormalities. Duplicated chromosomal\nsegments may fuse to existing chromosomes or may be free in the nucleus. Cri-du-chat (from the French for \u201ccry of the cat\u201d) is a\nsyndrome that occurs with nervous system abnormalities and identifiable physical features that result from a deletion of most\n5p (the small arm of chromosome 5) (Figure 13.10). Infants with this genotype emit a characteristic high-pitched cry on which\nthe disorder\u2019s name is based.\nFigure 13.10 This figure shows an individual with cri-du-chat syndrome at two, four, nine, and 12 years of age. (credit: Paola Cerruti\nMainardi)\nChromosomal Structural Rearrangements\nCytologists have characterized numerous structural rearrangements in chromosomes, but chromosome inversions and\ntranslocations are the most common. We can identify both during meiosis by the adaptive pairing of rearranged chromosomes\nwith their former homologs to maintain appropriate gene alignment. If the genes on two homologs are not oriented correctly, a\nrecombination event could result in losing genes from one chromosome and gaining genes on the other. This would produce\naneuploid gametes.\n13.2 \u2022 Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders\n339\nChromosome Inversions\nA chromosome inversion is the detachment, 180\u00b0 rotation, and reinsertion of part of a chromosome. Inversions may occur in\nnature as a result of mechanical shear, or from transposable elements' action (special DNA sequences capable of facilitating\nrearranging chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste DNA sequences). Unless they disrupt a gene\nsequence, inversions only change gene orientation and are likely to have more mild effects than aneuploid errors. However,\naltered gene orientation can result in functional changes because regulators of gene expression could move out of position with\nrespect to their targets, causing aberrant levels of gene products.\nAn inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere, or paracentric and occur outside the centromere (Figure 13.11). A\npericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the chromosome arms' relative lengths, making these\ninversions easily identifiable.\nFigure 13.11 Pericentric inversions include the centromere, and paracentric inversions do not. A pericentric inversion can change the\nchromosome arms' relative lengths. A paracentric inversion cannot.\nWhen one homologous chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other does not, the individual is an inversion heterozygote.\nTo maintain point-for-point synapsis during meiosis, one homolog must form a loop, and the other homolog must mold around\nit. Although this topology can ensure that the genes correctly align, it also forces the homologs to stretch and can occur with\nimprecise synapsis regions (Figure 13.12).\nFigure 13.12 When one chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other does not, one chromosome must form an inverted loop to retain\npoint-for-point interaction during synapsis. This inversion pairing is essential to maintaining gene alignment during meiosis and to allow for\nrecombination.\n340\nChapter 13 \u2022 Modern Understandings of Inheritance\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThe Chromosome 18 Inversion\nNot all chromosomes' structural rearrangements produce nonviable, impaired, or infertile individuals. In rare instances, such a\nchange can result in new species evolving. In fact, a pericentric inversion in chromosome 18 appears to have contributed to\nhuman evolution. This inversion is not present in our closest genetic relatives, the chimpanzees. Humans and chimpanzees\ndiffer cytogenetically by pericentric inversions on several chromosomes and by the fusion of two separate chromosomes in\nchimpanzees that correspond to chromosome two in humans.\nScientists believe the pericentric chromosome 18 inversion occurred in early humans following their divergence from a common\nancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago. Researchers characterizing this inversion have suggested that\napproximately 19,000 nucleotide bases were duplicated on 18p, and the duplicated region inverted and reinserted on\nchromosome 18 of an ancestral human.\nA comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this inversion indicates that two genes\u2014ROCK1 and\nUSP14\u2014that are adjacent on chimpanzee chromosome 17 (which corresponds to human chromosome 18) are more distantly\npositioned on human chromosome 18. This suggests that one of the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes.\nInterestingly, humans and chimpanzees express USP14 at distinct levels in specific cell types, including cortical cells and\nfibroblasts. Perhaps the chromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific genes and reset their expression\nlevels in a useful way. Because both ROCK1 and USP14 encode cellular enzymes, a change in their expression could alter cellular\nfunction. We do not know how this inversion contributed to hominid evolution, but it appears to be a significant factor in the\ndivergence of humans from other primates.1\nTranslocations\nA translocation occurs when a chromosome segment dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome.\nTranslocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to\nregulatory sequences. Notably, specific translocations have occurred with several cancers and with schizophrenia. Reciprocal\ntranslocations result from exchanging chromosome segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes such that there is no\ngenetic information gain or loss (Figure 13.13).\nFigure 13.13 A reciprocal translocation occurs when a DNA segment transfers from one chromosome to another, nonhomologous\nchromosome.

Instead, chromosome behavior involves\nsegregation, independent assortment, and occasionally,\nlinkage. Sturtevant devised a method to assess\nrecombination frequency and infer linked genes' relative\npositions and distances on a chromosome on the basis of the\naverage number of crossovers in the intervening region\nbetween the genes. Sturtevant correctly presumed that genes\nare arranged in serial order on chromosomes and that\nrecombination between homologs can occur anywhere on a\nchromosome with equal likelihood. Whereas linkage causes\nalleles on the same chromosome to be inherited together,\nhomologous recombination biases alleles toward an\nindependent inheritance pattern.\n13.2 Chromosomal Basis of\nInherited Disorders\nThe number, size, shape, and banding pattern of\nchromosomes make them easily identifiable in a karyogram\nand allows for the assessment of many chromosomal\nabnormalities.

DNA can be retrieved from hair, blood, or saliva. Each person\u2019s DNA is unique, and it is possible\nto detect differences between individuals within a species on the basis of these unique features.\nDNA analysis has many practical applications beyond forensics. In humans, DNA testing is applied to\nnumerous uses: determining paternity, tracing genealogy, identifying pathogens, archeological\nresearch, tracing disease outbreaks, and studying human migration patterns. In the medical field, DNA\nis used in diagnostics, new vaccine development, and cancer therapy. It is now possible to determine\npredisposition to diseases by looking at genes.\nEach human cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes: one set of chromosomes is inherited from the mother and\nthe other set is inherited from the father. There is also a mitochondrial genome, inherited exclusively\nfrom the mother, which can be involved in inherited genetic disorders. On each chromosome, there are\nthousands of genes that are responsible for determining the genotype and phenotype of the individual. A\ngene is defined as a sequence of DNA that codes for a functional product.

In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher (Figure 14.2), a physician by profession, isolated\nphosphate-rich chemicals from white blood cells (leukocytes). He named these chemicals (which would\neventually be known as DNA) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.\nFigure 14.2 Friedrich Miescher (1844\u20131895) discovered nucleic acids.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo see Miescher conduct his experiment that led to his discovery of DNA and associated proteins in the\nnucleus, click through this review (http://openstax.org/l/miescher_levene) .\nA half century later, in 1928, British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith reported the first demonstration of\nbacterial transformation\u2014a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing its\nmorphology and physiology. Griffith conducted his experiments with Streptococcus pneumoniae, a\nbacterium that causes pneumonia. Griffith worked with two strains of this bacterium called rough (R) and\nsmooth (S). (The two cell types were called \u201crough\u201d and \u201csmooth\u201d after the appearance of their colonies grown\non a nutrient agar plate.)\nThe R strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease). The S strain is pathogenic (disease-causing), and\nhas a capsule outside its cell wall. The capsule allows the cell to escape the immune responses of the host\nmouse.\nWhen Griffith injected the living S strain into mice, they died from pneumonia. In contrast, when Griffith\ninjected the live R strain into mice, they survived. In another experiment, when he injected mice with the\nheat-killed S strain, they also survived. This experiment showed that the capsule alone was not the cause of\ndeath. In a third set of experiments, a mixture of live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into\nmice, and\u2014to his surprise\u2014the mice died. Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse, only the S\nstrain of bacteria was recovered. When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh mice, the mice died.\nGriffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and\ntransformed it into the pathogenic S strain. He called this the transforming principle (Figure 14.3). These\nexperiments are now known as Griffith's transformation experiments.\n346\nChapter 14 \u2022 DNA Structure and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 14.3 Two strains of S. pneumoniae were used in Griffith\u2019s transformation experiments. The R strain is non-pathogenic, whereas the\nS strain is pathogenic and causes death. When Griffith injected a mouse with the heat-killed S strain and a live R strain, the mouse died. The\nS strain was recovered from the dead mouse. Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain to the R strain,\ntransforming the R strain into the S strain in the process. (credit \"living mouse\": modification of work by NIH; credit \"dead mouse\":\nmodification of work by Sarah Marriage)\nScientists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944) were interested in exploring this transforming principle\nfurther. They isolated the S strain from the dead mice and isolated the proteins and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) as these were\npossible candidates for the molecule of heredity. They used enzymes that specifically degraded each component and then used\neach mixture separately to transform the R strain. They found that when DNA was degraded, the resulting mixture was no\nlonger able to transform the bacteria, whereas all of the other combinations were able to transform the bacteria. This led them to\nconclude that DNA was the transforming principle.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nForensic Scientist\nForensic Scientists used DNA analysis evidence for the first time to solve an immigration case. The story started with a teenage\nboy returning to London from Ghana to be with his mother. Immigration authorities at the airport were suspicious of him,\nthinking that he was traveling on a forged passport. After much persuasion, he was allowed to go live with his mother, but the\nimmigration authorities did not drop the case against him. All types of evidence, including photographs, were provided to the\nauthorities, but deportation proceedings were started nevertheless. Around the same time, Dr. Alec Jeffreys of Leicester\nUniversity in the United Kingdom had invented a technique known as DNA fingerprinting. The immigration authorities\napproached Dr. Jeffreys for help. He took DNA samples from the mother and three of her children, as well as an unrelated\nmother, and compared the samples with the boy\u2019s DNA. Because the biological father was not in the picture, DNA from the three\nchildren was compared with the boy\u2019s DNA. He found a match in the boy\u2019s DNA for both the mother and his three siblings. He\nconcluded that the boy was indeed the mother\u2019s son.\nForensic scientists analyze many items, including documents, handwriting, firearms, and biological samples. They analyze the\nDNA content of hair, semen, saliva, and blood, and compare it with a database of DNA profiles of known criminals. Analysis\nincludes DNA isolation, sequencing, and sequence analysis. Forensic scientists are expected to appear at court hearings to\npresent their findings. They are usually employed in crime labs of city and state government agencies. Geneticists\nexperimenting with DNA techniques also work for scientific and research organizations, pharmaceutical industries, and college\nand university labs. Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist should have at least a bachelor's degree in\nchemistry, biology, or physics, and preferably some experience working in a laboratory.\nAlthough the experiments of Avery, McCarty and McLeod had demonstrated that DNA was the informational component\ntransferred during transformation, DNA was still considered to be too simple a molecule to carry biological information.\nProteins, with their 20 different amino acids, were regarded as more likely candidates. The decisive experiment, conducted by\nMartha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952, provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was indeed the genetic material and not\nproteins. Chase and Hershey were studying a bacteriophage\u2014a virus that infects bacteria. Viruses typically have a simple\n14.1 \u2022 Historical Basis of Modern Understanding\n347\nstructure: a protein coat, called the capsid, and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic material (either DNA or RNA). The\nbacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface, and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the cell. The\nphage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery, and eventually the host cell bursts, releasing a large\nnumber of bacteriophages. Hershey and Chase selected radioactive elements that would specifically distinguish the protein\nfrom the DNA in infected cells. They labeled one batch of phage with radioactive sulfur, 35S, to label the protein coat. Another\nbatch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus, 32P. Because phosphorous is found in DNA, but not protein, the DNA\nand not the protein would be tagged with radioactive phosphorus. Likewise, sulfur is absent from DNA, but present in several\namino acids such as methionine and cysteine.\nEach batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately. After infection, the phage bacterial suspension was put in a\nblender, which caused the phage coat to detach from the host cell. Cells exposed long enough for infection to occur were then\nexamined to see which of the two radioactive molecules had entered the cell. The phage and bacterial suspension was spun down\nin a centrifuge. The heavier bacterial cells settled down and formed a pellet, whereas the lighter phage particles stayed in the\nsupernatant. In the tube that contained phage labeled with 35S, the supernatant contained the radioactively labeled phage,\nwhereas no radioactivity was detected in the pellet. In the tube that contained the phage labeled with 32P, the radioactivity was\ndetected in the pellet that contained the heavier bacterial cells, and no radioactivity was detected in the supernatant. Hershey\nand Chase concluded that it was the phage DNA that was injected into the cell and carried information to produce more phage\nparticles, thus providing evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins (Figure 14.4).\nFigure 14.4 In Hershey and Chase's experiments, bacteria were infected with phage radiolabeled with either 35S, which labels protein, or\n32P, which labels DNA. Only 32P entered the bacterial cells, indicating that DNA is the genetic material.\nAround this same time, Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff examined the content of DNA in different species and found that\nthe amounts of adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine were not found in equal quantities, and that relative concentrations of\nthe four nucleotide bases varied from species to species, but not within tissues of the same individual or between individuals of\nthe same species. He also discovered something unexpected: That the amount of adenine equaled the amount of thymine, and\nthe amount of cytosine equaled the amount of guanine (that is, A = T and G = C). Different species had equal amounts of purines\n348\nChapter 14 \u2022 DNA Structure and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n(A+G) and pyrimidines (T + C), but different ratios of A+T to G+C. These observations became known as Chargaff\u2019s rules.\nChargaff's findings proved immensely useful when Watson and Crick were getting ready to propose their DNA double helix\nmodel! You can see after reading the past few pages how science builds upon previous discoveries, sometimes in a slow and\nlaborious process.\n14.2 DNA Structure and Sequencing\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the structure of DNA\n\u2022\nExplain the Sanger method of DNA sequencing\n\u2022\nDiscuss the similarities and differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA\nThe building blocks of DNA are nucleotides. The important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous (nitrogen-bearing)\nbase, a 5-carbon sugar (pentose), and a phosphate group (Figure 14.5). The nucleotide is named depending on the nitrogenous\nbase. The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (A) and guanine (G), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (C) and\nthymine (T).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 14.5 The purines have a double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines are smaller in\nsize; they have a single six-membered ring structure.\nThe images above illustrate the five bases of DNA and RNA. Examine the images and explain why these are called \u201cnitrogenous\nbases.\u201d How are the purines different from the pyrimidines? How is one purine or pyrimidine different from another, e.g.,\nadenine from guanine? How is a nucleoside different from a nucleotide?\nThe purines have a double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines are smaller in\nsize; they have a single six-membered ring structure.\nThe sugar is deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA. The carbon atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5'\n(1' is read as \u201cone prime\u201d). The phosphate, which makes DNA and RNA acidic, is connected to the 5' carbon of the sugar by the\nformation of an ester linkage between phosphoric acid and the 5'-OH group (an ester is an acid + an alcohol). In DNA\nnucleotides, the 3' carbon of the sugar deoxyribose is attached to a hydroxyl (OH) group. In RNA nucleotides, the 2' carbon of the\nsugar ribose also contains a hydroxyl group. The base is attached to the 1'carbon of the sugar.\nThe nucleotides combine with each other to produce phosphodiester bonds. The phosphate residue attached to the 5' carbon of\nthe sugar of one nucleotide forms a second ester linkage with the hydroxyl group of the 3' carbon of the sugar of the next\nnucleotide, thereby forming a 5'-3' phosphodiester bond. In a polynucleotide, one end of the chain has a free 5' phosphate, and\nthe other end has a free 3'-OH. These are called the 5' and 3' ends of the chain.\nIn the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together to determine the structure of DNA at the University of\nCambridge, England. Other scientists like Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins were also actively exploring this field. Pauling\n14.2 \u2022 DNA Structure and Sequencing\n349\npreviously had discovered the secondary structure of proteins using X-ray crystallography. In Wilkins\u2019 lab, researcher Rosalind\nFranklin was using X-ray diffraction methods to understand the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick were able to piece together\nthe puzzle of the DNA molecule on the basis of Franklin's data because Crick had also studied X-ray diffraction (Figure 14.6). In\n1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Unfortunately, by then\nFranklin had died, and Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously.\nFigure 14.6 The work of pioneering scientists (a) James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maclyn McCarty led to our present day understanding of\nDNA. Scientist Rosalind Franklin discovered (b) the X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA, which helped to elucidate its double-helix structure.\n(credit a: modification of work by Marjorie McCarty, Public Library of Science)\nWatson and Crick proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed\nhelix. Base pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine on opposite strands, so that A pairs with T, and G pairs with C\n(suggested by Chargaff's Rules). Thus, adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also\ncomplementary base pairs. The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds: adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and\ncytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, the 3' end of one strand\nfaces the 5' end of the other strand. The sugar and phosphate of the nucleotides form the backbone of the structure, whereas the\nnitrogenous bases are stacked inside, like the rungs of a ladder. Each base pair is separated from the next base pair by a distance\nof 0.34 nm, and each turn of the helix measures 3.4 nm. Therefore, 10 base pairs are present per turn of the helix. The diameter\nof the DNA double-helix is 2 nm, and it is uniform throughout. Only the pairing between a purine and pyrimidine and the\nantiparallel orientation of the two DNA strands can explain the uniform diameter. The twisting of the two strands around each\nother results in the formation of uniformly spaced major and minor grooves (Figure 14.7).\nFigure 14.7 DNA has (a) a double helix structure and (b) phosphodiester bonds; the dotted lines between Thymine and Adenine and\nGuanine and Cytosine represent hydrogen bonds. The (c) major and minor grooves are binding sites for DNA binding proteins during\nprocesses such as transcription (the copying of RNA from DNA) and replication.\nDNA Sequencing Techniques\nUntil the 1990s, the sequencing of DNA (reading the sequence of DNA) was a relatively expensive and long process. Using\nradiolabeled nucleotides also compounded the problem through safety concerns. With currently available technology and\n350\nChapter 14 \u2022 DNA Structure and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nautomated machines, the process is cheaper, safer, and can be completed in a matter of hours. Fred Sanger developed the\nsequencing method used for the human genome sequencing project, which is widely used today (Figure 14.8).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/DNA_sequencing) to watch a video explaining the DNA sequence-reading technique that\nresulted from Sanger\u2019s work.\nThe sequencing method is known as the dideoxy chain termination method. The method is based on the use of chain\nterminators, the dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The ddNTPSs differ from the deoxynucleotides by the lack of a free 3' OH group\non the five-carbon sugar. If a ddNTP is added to a growing DNA strand, the chain cannot be extended any further because the\nfree 3' OH group needed to add another nucleotide is not available. By using a predetermined ratio of deoxynucleotides to\ndideoxynucleotides, it is possible to generate DNA fragments of different sizes.\nFigure 14.8 In Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method, dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides are used to generate DNA fragments\nthat terminate at different points. The DNA is separated by capillary electrophoresis (not defined) on the basis of size, and from the order of\nfragments formed, the DNA sequence can be read. The DNA sequence readout is shown on an electropherogram (not defined) that is\ngenerated by a laser scanner.\nThe DNA sample to be sequenced is denatured (separated into two strands by heating it to high temperatures). The DNA is\ndivided into four tubes in which a primer, DNA polymerase, and all four nucleoside triphosphates (A, T, G, and C) are added. In\naddition, limited quantities of one of the four dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddCTP, ddATP, ddGTP, and ddTTP) are added to\neach tube respectively. The tubes are labeled as A, T, G, and C according to the ddNTP added. For detection purposes, each of the\nfour dideoxynucleotides carries a different fluorescent label. Chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy nucleotide\nis incorporated, after which no further elongation takes place. After the reaction is over, electrophoresis is performed. Even a\ndifference in length of a single base can be detected. The sequence is read from a laser scanner that detects the fluorescent\nmarker of each fragment. For his work on DNA sequencing, Sanger received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSanger\u2019s genome sequencing has led to a race to sequence human genomes at rapid speed and low cost.

Usually the gel is made of a chemical\ncalled agarose (a polysaccharide polymer extracted from seaweed that is high in galactose residues). Agarose powder is added to\na buffer and heated. After cooling, the gel solution is poured into a casting tray. Once the gel has solidified, the DNA is loaded on\nthe gel and electric current is applied. The DNA has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the\npositive electrode. The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according to size; the smallest\nfragments will be farthest from the well (where the DNA was loaded), and the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest\nto the well. Once the DNA is separated, the gel is stained with a DNA-specific dye for viewing it (Figure 14.9).\n14.2 \u2022 DNA Structure and Sequencing\n351\nFigure 14.9 DNA can be separated on the basis of size using gel electrophoresis.

Green et al. in 2010.1 Neanderthals are\nthe closest ancestors of present-day humans. They were known to have lived in Europe and Western Asia (and now, perhaps, in\nNorthern Africa) before they disappeared from fossil records approximately 30,000 years ago. Green\u2019s team studied almost\n40,000-year-old fossil remains that were selected from sites across the world. Extremely sophisticated means of sample\npreparation and DNA sequencing were employed because of the fragile nature of the bones and heavy microbial contamination.\nIn their study, the scientists were able to sequence some four billion base pairs. The Neanderthal sequence was compared with\nthat of present-day humans from across the world. After comparing the sequences, the researchers found that the Neanderthal\ngenome had 2 to 3 percent greater similarity to people living outside Africa than to people in Africa. While current theories have\nsuggested that all present-day humans can be traced to a small ancestral population in Africa, the data from the Neanderthal\ngenome suggest some interbreeding between Neanderthals and early modern humans.\nGreen and his colleagues also discovered DNA segments among people in Europe and Asia that are more similar to Neanderthal\nsequences than to other contemporary human sequences. Another interesting observation was that Neanderthals are as closely\nrelated to people from Papua New Guinea as to those from China or France. This is surprising because Neanderthal fossil\nremains have been located only in Europe and West Asia. Most likely, genetic exchange took place between Neanderthals and\nmodern humans as modern humans emerged out of Africa, before the divergence of Europeans, East Asians, and Papua New\nGuineans.\nSeveral genes seem to have undergone changes from Neanderthals during the evolution of present-day humans. These genes are\ninvolved in cranial structure, metabolism, skin morphology, and cognitive development. One of the genes that is of particular\ninterest is RUNX2, which is different in modern day humans and Neanderthals. This gene is responsible for the prominent\nfrontal bone, bell-shaped rib cage, and dental differences seen in Neanderthals. It is speculated that an evolutionary change in\nRUNX2 was important in the origin of modern-day humans, and this affected the cranium and the upper body.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo\u2019s talk (http://openstax.org/l/neanderthal) explaining the Neanderthal genome research at the 2011 annual\nTED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) conference.\nDNA Packaging in Cells\nProkaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features (Figure 14.10). Most prokaryotes contain a single,\ncircular chromosome that is found in an area of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid region.\n1Richard E. Green et al., \u201cA Draft Sequence of the Neandertal Genome,\u201d Science 328 (2010): 710-22.\n352\nChapter 14 \u2022 DNA Structure and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 14.10 A eukaryote contains a well-defined nucleus, whereas in prokaryotes, the chromosome lies in the cytoplasm in an area called\nthe nucleoid.\nIn eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis occur in a separate compartment from protein synthesis. In prokaryotic cells, both\nprocesses occur together. What advantages might there be to separating the processes? What advantages might there be to\nhaving them occur together?\nThe size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes, E.coli, is 4.6 million base pairs (approximately 1.1 mm, if cut\nand stretched out). So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted by what is known as supercoiling.\nSupercoiling suggests that DNA is either \u201cunder-wound\u201d (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or \u201cover-wound\u201d\n(more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling;\nother proteins and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.\nEukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their\nDNA inside the nucleus (Figure 14.11). At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form\nstructures called nucleosomes. The histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids and form an\noctamer composed of two molecules of each of four different histones. The DNA (remember, it is negatively charged because of\nthe phosphate groups) is wrapped tightly around the histone core. This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a\nlinker DNA. This is also known as the \u201cbeads on a string\u201d structure. With the help of a fifth histone, a string of nucleosomes is\nfurther compacted into a 30-nm fiber, which is the diameter of the structure. Metaphase chromosomes are even further\ncondensed by association with scaffolding proteins. At the metaphase stage, the chromosomes are at their most compact,\napproximately 700 nm in width.\nIn interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. The tightly packaged\nregion is known as heterochromatin, and the less dense region is known as euchromatin. Heterochromatin usually contains\ngenes that are not expressed, and is found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The euchromatin usually contains\ngenes that are transcribed, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.\n14.2 \u2022 DNA Structure and Sequencing\n353\nFigure 14.11 These figures illustrate the compaction of the eukaryotic chromosome.\n14.3 Basics of DNA Replication\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how the structure of DNA reveals the replication process\n\u2022\nDescribe the Meselson and Stahl experiments\nThe elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of itself. In their\n1953 paper, Watson and Crick penned an incredible understatement: \"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we\nhave postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.\" With specific base pairs, the\nsequence of one DNA strand can be predicted from its complement. The double-helix model suggests that the two strands of the\ndouble helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is\ncopied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three models suggested (Figure 14.12): conservative,\nsemi-conservative, and dispersive.\n354\nChapter 14 \u2022 DNA Structure and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 14.12 The three suggested models of DNA replication. Gray indicates the original DNA strands, and blue indicates newly synthesized\nDNA.\nIn conservative replication, the parental DNA remains together, and the newly formed daughter strands are together. The semi-\nconservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands acts as a template for new DNA to be synthesized; after\nreplication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or \u201cold\u201d strand and one \u201cnew\u201d strand. In the dispersive model,\nboth copies of DNA have double-stranded segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA interspersed.\nMeselson and Stahl were interested in understanding how DNA replicates. They grew E. coli for several generations in a\nmedium containing a \u201cheavy\u201d isotope of nitrogen (15N), which gets incorporated into nitrogenous bases, and eventually into the\nDNA (Figure 14.13).\nFigure 14.13 Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli grown first in heavy nitrogen (15N) then in 14N. DNA grown in 15N (red band) is\nheavier than DNA grown in 14N (orange band), and sediments to a lower level in cesium chloride solution in an ultracentrifuge. When DNA\ngrown in 15N is switched to media containing 14N, after one round of cell division the DNA sediments halfway between the 15N and 14N\nlevels, indicating that it now contains fifty percent 14N. In subsequent cell divisions, an increasing amount of DNA contains 14N only. These\n14.3 \u2022 Basics of DNA Replication\n355\ndata support the semi-conservative replication model. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe E. coli culture was then placed into medium containing 14N and allowed to grow for several generations. After each of the\nfirst few generations, the cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated, then centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge.\nDuring the centrifugation, the DNA was loaded into a gradient (typically a solution of salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose)\nand spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm. Under these circumstances, the DNA will form a band according to its\nbuoyant density: the density within the gradient at which it floats. DNA grown in 15N will form a band at a higher density\nposition (i.e., farther down the centrifuge tube) than that grown in 14N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of\ngrowth in 14N after they had been shifted from 15N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of\ncells grown exclusively in 15N and 14N. This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication. The DNA\nharvested from cells grown for two generations in 14N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position\nbetween 15N and 14N, and the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA. These results could only be explained if DNA replicates\nin a semi-conservative manner. And for this reason, therefore, the other two models were ruled out.\nDuring DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are\ncopied. The new strands will be complementary to the parental or \u201cold\u201d strands. When two daughter DNA copies are formed,\nthey have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter cells.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView this video (http://openstax.org/l/DNA_replicatio2) on DNA replication.\n14.4 DNA Replication in Prokaryotes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain the process of DNA replication in prokaryotes\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of different enzymes and proteins in supporting this process\nDNA replication has been well studied in prokaryotes primarily because of the small size of the genome and because of the large\nvariety of mutants that are available. E. coli has 4.6 million base pairs in a single circular chromosome and all of it gets\nreplicated in approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single site along the chromosome and proceeding around the circle in\nboth directions. This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. Thus, the process is quite rapid and\noccurs without many mistakes.\nDNA replication employs a large number of structural proteins and enzymes, each of which plays a critical role during the\nprocess. One of the key players is the enzyme DNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol, which adds nucleotides one-by-one to\nthe growing DNA chain that is complementary to the template strand. The addition of nucleotides requires energy; this energy\nis obtained from the nucleoside triphosphates ATP, GTP, TTP and CTP. Like ATP, the other NTPs (nucleoside triphosphates) are\nhigh-energy molecules that can serve both as the source of DNA nucleotides and the source of energy to drive the\npolymerization. When the bond between the phosphates is \u201cbroken,\u201d the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester\nbond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain. In prokaryotes, three main types of polymerases are known:\nDNA pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis; DNA pol I is\nan important accessory enzyme in DNA replication, and along with DNA pol II, is primarily required for repair.\nHow does the replication machinery know where to begin? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called\norigins of replication where replication begins. In E. coli, which has a single origin of replication on its one chromosome (as do\nmost prokaryotes), this origin of replication is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in AT sequences. The origin of\nreplication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site. An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the\nhydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs. ATP hydrolysis is required for this process. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped\nstructures called replication forks are formed. Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get\nextended bi-directionally as replication proceeds. Single-strand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the\nreplication fork to prevent the single-stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix.\nDNA polymerase has two important restrictions: it is able to add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction (a new DNA strand can\nbe only extended in this direction). It also requires a free 3'-OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a\nphosphodiester bond between the 3'-OH end and the 5' phosphate of the next nucleotide. This essentially means that it cannot\nadd nucleotides if a free 3'-OH group is not available. Then how does it add the first nucleotide? The problem is solved with the\n356\nChapter 14 \u2022 DNA Structure and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nhelp of a primer that provides the free 3'-OH end. Another enzyme, RNA primase, synthesizes an RNA segment that is about\nfive to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the template DNA. Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis, it is\nappropriately called the primer. DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer, adding nucleotides one-by-one that are\ncomplementary to the template strand (Figure 14.14).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 14.14 A replication fork is formed when helicase separates the DNA strands at the origin of replication. The DNA tends to become\nmore highly coiled ahead of the replication fork. Topoisomerase breaks and reforms DNA\u2019s phosphate backbone ahead of the replication\nfork, thereby relieving the pressure that results from this \u201csupercoiling.\u201d Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded DNA to\nprevent the helix from re-forming. Primase synthesizes an RNA primer. DNA polymerase III uses this primer to synthesize the daughter\nDNA strand. On the leading strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches\ncalled Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase I replaces the RNA primer with DNA. DNA ligase seals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments,\njoining the fragments into a single DNA molecule. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nQuestion: You isolate a cell strain in which the joining of Okazaki fragments is impaired and suspect that a mutation has\noccurred in an enzyme found at the replication fork. Which enzyme is most likely to be mutated?\nThe replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second. Topoisomerase prevents the over-winding of the DNA\ndouble helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and\nthen resealing it. Because DNA polymerase can only extend in the 5' to 3' direction, and because the DNA double helix is\nantiparallel, there is a slight problem at the replication fork. The two template DNA strands have opposing orientations: one\nstrand is in the 5' to 3' direction and the other is oriented in the 3' to 5' direction. Only one new DNA strand, the one that is\ncomplementary to the 3' to 5' parental DNA strand, can be synthesized continuously towards the replication fork. This\ncontinuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand. The other strand, complementary to the 5' to 3' parental DNA,\nis extended away from the replication fork, in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments, each requiring a primer to start\nthe synthesis. New primer segments are laid down in the direction of the replication fork, but each pointing away from it.\n(Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is\nknown as the lagging strand.)\nThe leading strand can be extended from a single primer, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short\nOkazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'. A protein\ncalled the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is a ring-\nshaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by\nDNA. The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, which uses DNA behind the RNA as its own primer and\nfills in the gaps left by removal of the RNA nucleotides by the addition of DNA nucleotides. The nicks that remain between the\nnewly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA\nligase, which catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkages between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate\nend of the other fragment.\nOnce the chromosome has been completely replicated, the two DNA copies move into two different cells during cell division.\n14.4 \u2022 DNA Replication in Prokaryotes\n357\nThe process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows:\n1.\nDNA unwinds at the origin of replication.\n2.\nHelicase opens up the DNA-forming replication forks; these are extended bidirectionally.\n3.\nSingle-strand binding proteins coat the DNA around the replication fork to prevent rewinding of the DNA.\n4.\nTopoisomerase binds at the region ahead of the replication fork to prevent supercoiling.\n5.\nPrimase synthesizes RNA primers complementary to the DNA strand.\n6.\nDNA polymerase III starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer.\n7.\nElongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues.\n8.\nRNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity.\n9.\nGaps are filled by DNA pol I by adding dNTPs.\n10.\nThe gap between the two DNA fragments is sealed by DNA ligase, which helps in the formation of phosphodiester bonds.\nTable 14.1 summarizes the enzymes involved in prokaryotic DNA replication and the functions of each.\nProkaryotic DNA Replication: Enzymes and Their Function\nEnzyme/protein\nSpecific Function\nDNA pol I\nRemoves RNA primer and replaces it with newly synthesized DNA\nDNA pol III\nMain enzyme that adds nucleotides in the 5'-3' direction\nHelicase\nOpens the DNA helix by breaking hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases\nLigase\nSeals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments to create one continuous DNA strand\nPrimase\nSynthesizes RNA primers needed to start replication\nSliding Clamp\nHelps to hold the DNA polymerase in place when nucleotides are being added\nTopoisomerase\nHelps relieve the strain on DNA when unwinding by causing breaks, and then resealing\nthe DNA\nSingle-strand binding proteins\n(SSB)\nBinds to single-stranded DNA to prevent DNA from rewinding back.\nTable 14.1\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReview the full process of DNA replication here (http://openstax.org/l/replication_DNA) .\n14.5 DNA Replication in Eukaryotes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the similarities and differences between DNA replication in eukaryotes and prokaryotes\n\u2022\nState the role of telomerase in DNA replication\nEukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes. Eukaryotes also have a number of\ndifferent linear chromosomes. The human genome has 3 billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base\npairs are replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle. There are multiple origins of replication on each eukaryotic\nchromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of replication across the genome. The rate of replication is approximately\n358\nChapter 14 \u2022 DNA Structure and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n100 nucleotides per second, much slower than prokaryotic replication. In yeast, which is a eukaryote, special sequences known\nas autonomously replicating sequences (ARS) are found on the chromosomes. These are equivalent to the origin of replication in\nE. coli.\nThe number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than in prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to have\nmajor roles during replication and have been well studied. They are known as pol \u03b1, pol \u03b2, pol \u03b3, pol \u03b4, and pol \u03b5.\nThe essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes. Before replication can start, the DNA has to be made available\nas a template. Eukaryotic DNA is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. Histones\nmust be removed and then replaced during the replication process, which helps to account for the lower replication rate in\neukaryotes. The chromatin (the complex between DNA and proteins) may undergo some chemical modifications, so that the\nDNA may be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible to the enzymes of the DNA replication machinery. At the origin of\nreplication, a pre-replication complex is made with other initiator proteins. Helicase and other proteins are then recruited to\nstart the replication process (Table 14.2).\nDifference between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Replication\nProperty\nProkaryotes\nEukaryotes\nOrigin of replication\nSingle\nMultiple\nRate of replication\n1000 nucleotides/s\n50 to 100 nucleotides/s\nDNA polymerase types\n5\n14\nTelomerase\nNot present\nPresent\nRNA primer removal\nDNA pol I\nRNase H\nStrand elongation\nDNA pol III\nPol \u03b1, pol \u03b4, pol \u03b5\nSliding clamp\nSliding clamp\nPCNA\nTable 14.2\nA helicase using the energy from ATP hydrolysis opens up the DNA helix. Replication forks are formed at each replication origin\nas the DNA unwinds. The opening of the double helix causes over-winding, or supercoiling, in the DNA ahead of the replication\nfork. These are resolved with the action of topoisomerases. Primers are formed by the enzyme primase, and using the primer,\nDNA pol can start synthesis. Three major DNA polymerases are then involved: \u03b1, \u03b4 and \u03b5. DNA pol \u03b1 adds a short (20 to 30\nnucleotides) DNA fragment to the RNA primer on both strands, and then hands off to a second polymerase. While the leading\nstrand is continuously synthesized by the enzyme pol \u03b5, the lagging strand is synthesized by pol \u03b4. A sliding clamp protein\nknown as PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) holds the DNA pol in place so that it does not slide off the DNA. As pol \u03b4 runs\ninto the primer RNA on the lagging strand, it displaces it from the DNA template. The displaced primer RNA is then removed by\nRNase H (AKA flap endonuclease) and replaced with DNA nucleotides. The Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand are joined\nafter the replacement of the RNA primers with DNA. The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA ligase, which forms the\nphosphodiester bond.\nTelomere replication\nUnlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. As you\u2019ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add\nnucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached.\nOn the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When the\nreplication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no way to replace the primer on the 5\u2019 end of the lagging\nstrand. The DNA at the ends of the chromosome thus remains unpaired, and over time these ends, called telomeres, may get\nprogressively shorter as cells continue to divide.\n14.5 \u2022 DNA Replication in Eukaryotes\n359\nTelomeres comprise repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene. In humans, a six-base-pair sequence, TTAGGG, is\nrepeated 100 to 1000 times in the telomere regions. In a way, these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells\ncontinue to divide. The telomeres are added to the ends of chromosomes by a separate enzyme, telomerase (Figure 14.16), whose\ndiscovery helped in the understanding of how these repetitive chromosome ends are maintained. The telomerase enzyme\ncontains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and DNA nucleotides\ncomplementary to the RNA template are added on the 3' end of the DNA strand. Once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is\nsufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the\nends of the chromosomes are replicated.\nFigure 14.15 The ends of linear chromosomes are maintained by the action of the telomerase enzyme.\nTelomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem cells. It is not active in adult somatic cells. For their discovery of\ntelomerase and its action, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol W. Greider, and Jack W. Szostak (Figure 14.16) received the Nobel Prize for\nMedicine and Physiology in 2009.\nFigure 14.16 Elizabeth Blackburn, 2009 Nobel Laureate, is one of the scientists who discovered how telomerase works. (credit: US\n360\nChapter 14 \u2022 DNA Structure and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nEmbassy Sweden)\nTelomerase and Aging\nCells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened because most somatic cells do not make telomerase.\nThis essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. With the advent of modern medicine, preventative\nhealth care, and healthier lifestyles, the human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for people to look\nyounger and have a better quality of life as they grow older.\nIn 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice. This may have potential in\nregenerative medicine.2 Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice have tissue atrophy, stem cell\ndepletion, organ system failure, and impaired tissue injury responses. Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension\nof telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen, and\nintestines. Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans.\nCancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. The cells accumulate mutations, proliferate\nuncontrollably, and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis. Scientists have observed that\ncancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is active in these cells. Interestingly, only after the\ntelomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become active. If the action of telomerase in these cells can be\ninhibited by drugs during cancer therapy, then the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped from further division.\n14.6 DNA Repair\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the different types of mutations in DNA\n\u2022\nExplain DNA repair mechanisms\nDNA replication is a highly accurate process, but mistakes can occasionally occur, such as a DNA polymerase inserting a wrong\nbase. Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Repair mechanisms correct the\nmistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves\nmutated or defective.\nMost of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by the proofreading ability of DNA polymerase itself.\n(Figure 14.17). In proofreading, the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one, so a correction can be\nmade. The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand. If it is the\nright base, the next nucleotide is added. If an incorrect base has been added, the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester\nbond and releases the wrong nucleotide. This is performed by the 3' exonuclease action of DNA pol. Once the incorrect\nnucleotide has been removed, it can be replaced by the correct one.\nFigure 14.17 Proofreading by DNA polymerase corrects errors during replication.\nSome errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected after replication is completed; this type of repair is\nknown as mismatch repair (Figure 14.18). Specific repair enzymes recognize the mispaired nucleotide and excise part of the\nstrand that contains it; the excised region is then resynthesized. If the mismatch remains uncorrected, it may lead to more\npermanent damage when the mismatched DNA is replicated. How do mismatch repair enzymes recognize which of the two\nbases is the incorrect one? In E. coli, after replication, the nitrogenous base adenine acquires a methyl group; the parental DNA\n2Jaskelioff et al., \u201cTelomerase reactivation reverses tissue degeneration in aged telomerase-deficient mice,\u201d Nature 469 (2011): 102-7.\n14.6 \u2022 DNA Repair\n361\nstrand will have methyl groups, whereas the newly synthesized strand lacks them. Thus, DNA polymerase is able to remove the\nwrongly incorporated bases from the newly synthesized, non-methylated strand. In eukaryotes, the mechanism is not very well\nunderstood, but it is believed to involve recognition of unsealed nicks in the new strand, as well as a short-term continuing\nassociation of some of the replication proteins with the new daughter strand after replication has completed.\nFigure 14.18 In mismatch repair, the incorrectly added base is detected after replication. The mismatch repair proteins detect this base\nand remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease action. The gap is now filled with the correctly paired base.\nAnother type of repair mechanism, nucleotide excision repair, is similar to mismatch repair, except that it is used to remove\ndamaged bases rather than mismatched ones. The repair enzymes replace abnormal bases by making a cut on both the 3' and 5'\nends of the damaged base (Figure 14.19). The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by\nthe action of DNA pol. Once the bases are filled in, the remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester linkage catalyzed by DNA\nligase. This repair mechanism is often employed when UV exposure causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers.\n362\nChapter 14 \u2022 DNA Structure and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 14.19 Nucleotide excision repairs thymine dimers. When exposed to UV light, thymines lying adjacent to each other can form\nthymine dimers. In normal cells, they are excised and replaced.\nA well-studied example of mistakes not being corrected is seen in people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa (Figure 14.20).\nAffected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun. When individuals are exposed to UV light,\npyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to repair the\ndamage. These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes, whereas in normal individuals,\nthe thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected. The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA double helix,\nand this may cause problems during DNA replication. People with xeroderma pigmentosa may have a higher risk of contracting\nskin cancer than those who don't have the condition.\nFigure 14.20 Xeroderma pigmentosa is a condition in which thymine dimerization from exposure to UV light is not repaired. Exposure to\nsunlight results in skin lesions. (credit: James Halpern et al.)\nErrors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA. Mutations, variations in the nucleotide\nsequence of a genome, can also occur because of damage to DNA. Such mutations may be of two types: induced or spontaneous.\nInduced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals, UV rays, x-rays, or some other environmental agent.\nSpontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent; they are a result of natural reactions taking\nplace within the body.\nMutations may have a wide range of effects. Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair. The most\ncommon nucleotide mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another. These substitutions can be of two\ntypes, either transitions or transversions. Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of\n14.6 \u2022 DNA Repair\n363\nthe same kind; for example, a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine. Transversion substitution refers\nto a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine.\nSome point mutations are not expressed; these are known as silent mutations. Silent mutations are usually due to a substitution\nin the third base of a codon, which often represents the same amino acid as the original codon. Other point mutations can result\nin the replacement of one amino acid by another, which may alter the function of the protein. Point mutations that generate a\nstop codon can terminate a protein early.\nSome mutations can result in an increased number of copies of the same codon. These are called trinucleotide repeat expansions\nand result in repeated regions of the same amino acid. Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base, known as an\ninsertion, or the removal of a base, also known as deletion. If an insertion or deletion results in the alteration of the translational\nreading frame (a frameshift mutation), the resultant protein is usually nonfunctional. Sometimes a piece of DNA from one\nchromosome may get translocated to another chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome; this is also known as\ntranslocation. These mutation types are shown in Figure 14.21.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 14.21 Mutations can lead to changes in the protein sequence encoded by the DNA.\nA frameshift mutation that results in the insertion of three nucleotides is often less deleterious than a mutation that results in\nthe insertion of one nucleotide. Why?\nMutations in repair genes have been known to cause cancer. Many mutated repair genes have been implicated in certain forms\nof pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and colorectal cancer. Mutations can affect either somatic cells or germ cells. If many\nmutations accumulate in a somatic cell, they may lead to problems such as the uncontrolled cell division observed in cancer. If a\nmutation takes place in germ cells, the mutation will be passed on to the next generation, as in the case of hemophilia and\nxeroderma pigmentosa.\n364\nChapter 14 \u2022 DNA Structure and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nelectrophoresis\ntechnique used to separate DNA fragments\naccording to size\nhelicase\nduring replication, this enzyme helps to open up\nthe DNA helix by breaking the hydrogen bonds\ninduced mutation\nmutation that results from exposure to\nchemicals or environmental agents\nlagging strand\nduring replication, the strand that is\nreplicated in short fragments and away from the\nreplication fork\nleading strand\nstrand that is synthesized continuously in\nthe 5'-3' direction, which is synthesized in the direction of\nthe replication fork\nligase\nenzyme that catalyzes the formation of a\nphosphodiester linkage between the 3' OH and 5'\nphosphate ends of the DNA\nmismatch repair\ntype of repair mechanism in which\nmismatched bases are removed after replication\nmutation\nvariation in the nucleotide sequence of a genome\nnucleotide excision repair\ntype of DNA repair mechanism\nin which the wrong base, along with a few nucleotides\nupstream or downstream, are removed\nOkazaki fragment\nDNA fragment that is synthesized in\nshort stretches on the lagging strand\npoint mutation\nmutation that affects a single base\nprimase\nenzyme that synthesizes the RNA primer; the\nprimer is needed for DNA pol to start synthesis of a new\nDNA strand\nprimer\nshort stretch of nucleotides that is required to\ninitiate replication; in the case of replication, the primer\nhas RNA nucleotides\nproofreading\nfunction of DNA pol in which it reads the\nnewly added base before adding the next one\nreplication fork\nY-shaped structure formed during\ninitiation of replication\nsilent mutation\nmutation that is not expressed\nsingle-strand binding protein\nduring replication, protein\nthat binds to the single-stranded DNA; this helps in\nkeeping the two strands of DNA apart so that they may\nserve as templates\nsliding clamp\nring-shaped protein that holds the DNA pol\non the DNA strand\nspontaneous mutation\nmutation that takes place in the\ncells as a result of chemical reactions taking place\nnaturally without exposure to any external agent\ntelomerase\nenzyme that contains a catalytic part and an\ninbuilt RNA template; it functions to maintain telomeres\nat chromosome ends\ntelomere\nDNA at the end of linear chromosomes\ntopoisomerase\nenzyme that causes underwinding or\noverwinding of DNA when DNA replication is taking\nplace\ntransformation\nprocess in which external DNA is taken up\nby a cell\ntransition substitution\nwhen a purine is replaced with a\npurine or a pyrimidine is replaced with another\npyrimidine\ntransversion substitution\nwhen a purine is replaced by a\npyrimidine or a pyrimidine is replaced by a purine\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n14.1 Historical Basis of Modern\nUnderstanding\nDNA was first isolated from white blood cells by Friedrich\nMiescher, who called it nuclein because it was isolated from\nnuclei. Frederick Griffith's experiments with strains of\nStreptococcus pneumoniae provided the first hint that DNA\nmay be the transforming principle. Avery, MacLeod, and\nMcCarty showed that DNA is required for the\ntransformation of bacteria. Later experiments by Hershey\nand Chase using bacteriophage T2 proved that DNA is the\ngenetic material. Chargaff found that the ratio of A = T and C\n= G, and that the percentage content of A, T, G, and C is\ndifferent for different species.\n14.2 DNA Structure and Sequencing\nThe currently accepted model of the double-helix structure of\nDNA was proposed by Watson and Crick. Some of the salient\nfeatures are that the two strands that make up the double\nhelix have complementary base sequences and anti-parallel\norientations. Alternating deoxyribose sugars and phosphates\nform the backbone of the structure, and the nitrogenous\nbases are stacked like rungs inside. The diameter of the\ndouble helix, 2 nm, is uniform throughout. A purine always\npairs with a pyrimidine; A pairs with T, and G pairs with C.\nOne turn of the helix has 10 base pairs. Prokaryotes are much\nsimpler than eukaryotes in many of their features. Most\nprokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome. In\ngeneral, eukaryotic chromosomes contain a linear DNA\nmolecule packaged into nucleosomes, and have two distinct\nregions that can be distinguished by staining, reflecting\ndifferent states of packaging and compaction.\n14.3 Basics of DNA Replication\nDuring cell division, each daughter cell receives a copy of\neach molecule of DNA by a process known as DNA\nreplication. The single chromosome of a prokaryote or each\nchromosome of a eukaryote consists of a single continuous\ndouble helix. The model for DNA replication suggests that\nthe two strands of the double helix separate during\nChapter 14 \u2022 Key Terms\n365\nreplication, and each strand serves as a template from which\nthe new complementary strand is copied. In the conservative\nmodel of replication, the parental DNA is conserved, and the\ndaughter DNA is newly synthesized. The semi-conservative\nmodel suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands\nacts as template for new DNA to be synthesized; after\nreplication, each double-stranded DNA retains the parental\nor \u201cold\u201d strand and one \u201cnew\u201d strand. The dispersive model\nsuggested that the two copies of the DNA would have\nsegments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA. The\nMeselson and Stahl experiment supported the semi-\nconservative model of replication, in which an entire\nreplicated chromosome consists of one parental strand and\none newly synthesized strand of DNA.\n14.4 DNA Replication in\nProkaryotes\nReplication in prokaryotes starts from a sequence found on\nthe chromosome called the origin of replication\u2014the point\nat which the DNA opens up. Helicase opens up the DNA\ndouble helix, resulting in the formation of the replication\nfork. Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-\nstranded DNA near the replication fork to keep the fork\nopen. Primase synthesizes an RNA primer to initiate\nsynthesis by DNA polymerase, which can add nucleotides\nonly to the 3' end of a previously synthesized primer strand.\nBoth new DNA strands grow according to their respective\n5'-3' directions. One strand is synthesized continuously in\nthe direction of the replication fork; this is called the leading\nstrand. The other strand is synthesized in a direction away\nfrom the replication fork, in short stretches of DNA known\nas Okazaki fragments. This strand is known as the lagging\nstrand. Once replication is completed, the RNA primers are\nreplaced by DNA nucleotides and the DNA is sealed with\nDNA ligase, which creates phosphodiester bonds between\nthe 3'-OH of one end and the 5' phosphate of the other\nstrand.\n14.5 DNA Replication in Eukaryotes\nReplication in eukaryotes starts at multiple origins of\nreplication. The mechanism is quite similar to that in\nprokaryotes. A primer is required to initiate synthesis, which\nis then extended by DNA polymerase as it adds nucleotides\none by one to the growing chain. The leading strand is\nsynthesized continuously, whereas the lagging strand is\nsynthesized in short stretches called Okazaki fragments. The\nRNA primers are replaced with DNA nucleotides; the DNA\nOkazaki fragments are linked into one continuous strand by\nDNA ligase. The ends of the chromosomes pose a problem as\nthe primer RNA at the 5\u2019 ends of the DNA cannot be replaced\nwith DNA, and the chromosome is progressively shortened.\nTelomerase, an enzyme with an inbuilt RNA template,\nextends the ends by copying the RNA template and\nextending one strand of the chromosome. DNA polymerase\ncan then fill in the complementary DNA strand using the\nregular replication enzymes. In this way, the ends of the\nchromosomes are protected.\n14.6 DNA Repair\nDNA polymerase can make mistakes while adding\nnucleotides. It edits the DNA by proofreading every newly\nadded base. Incorrect bases are removed and replaced by the\ncorrect base before proceeding with elongation. Most\nmistakes are corrected during replication, although when\nthis does not happen, the mismatch repair mechanism is\nemployed. Mismatch repair enzymes recognize the wrongly\nincorporated base and excise it from the DNA, replacing it\nwith the correct base. In yet another type of repair,\nnucleotide excision repair, a damaged base is removed along\nwith a few bases on the 5' and 3' end, and these are replaced\nby copying the template with the help of DNA polymerase.\nThe ends of the newly synthesized fragment are attached to\nthe rest of the DNA using DNA ligase, which creates a\nphosphodiester bond.\nMost mistakes are corrected, and if they are not, they may\nresult in a mutation, defined as a permanent change in the\nDNA sequence. Mutations can be of many types, such as\nsubstitution, deletion, insertion, and trinucleotide repeat\nexpansions. Mutations in repair genes may lead to serious\nconsequences such as cancer. Mutations can be induced or\nmay occur spontaneously.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

Genes are composed of DNA and are linearly arranged on\nchromosomes. Genes specify the sequences of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. In\nturn, proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every function of the cell. Both genes and the\nproteins they encode are absolutely essential to life as we know it.\nChapter Outline\n15.1 The Genetic Code\n15.2 Prokaryotic\nTranscription\n15.3 Eukaryotic\nTranscription\n15.4 RNA Processing in\nEukaryotes\n15.5 Ribosomes and\nProtein Synthesis\nmore genes with an alphabet of A, C, G, and uracil (U). Translation of the mRNA template on ribosomes\nconverts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. That is the central dogma of DNA-\nprotein synthesis. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said\nthat the protein alphabet consists of 20 \u201cletters\u201d (Figure 15.2). Different amino acids have different\nchemistries (such as acidic versus basic, or polar and nonpolar) and different structural constraints.\nVariation in amino acid sequence is responsible for the enormous variation in protein structure and\nfunction.\nFigure 15.2 Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown. Each amino acid is composed of an amino\ngroup (\n), a carboxyl group (COO-), and a side chain (blue). The side chain may be nonpolar, polar, or charged, as\nwell as large or small. It is the variety of amino acid side chains that gives rise to the incredible variation of protein\nstructure and function.\nThe Central Dogma: DNA Encodes RNA; RNA Encodes Protein\nThe flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the central dogma\n(Figure 15.3), which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs, which in turn specify the sequence of\namino acids making up all proteins. The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific\nproteins and RNAs. Because the information stored in DNA is so central to cellular function, it makes\nintuitive sense that the cell would make mRNA copies of this information for protein synthesis, while\nkeeping the DNA itself intact and protected. The copying of DNA to RNA is relatively straightforward, with\none nucleotide being added to the mRNA strand for every nucleotide read in the DNA strand. The translation\nto protein is a bit more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the\npolypeptide sequence. However, the translation to protein is still systematic and colinear, such that\nnucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on.\n370\nChapter 15 \u2022 Genes and Proteins\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 15.3 Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA. Ribosomes are able to read the genetic information inscribed on a\nstrand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a protein.\nThe Genetic Code Is Degenerate and Universal\nEach amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. Given the different numbers of \u201cletters\u201d in\nthe mRNA and protein \u201calphabets,\u201d scientists theorized that single amino acids must be represented by combinations of\nnucleotides. Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid because there are only 16 possible two-\nnucleotide combinations (42). In contrast, there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets (43), which is far more than the number of\n15.1 \u2022 The Genetic Code\n371\namino acids. Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was\n\u201cdegenerate.\u201d In other words, a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet. This was later\nconfirmed experimentally: Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner used the chemical mutagen proflavin to insert one, two, or three\nnucleotides into the gene of a virus. When one or two nucleotides were inserted, the normal proteins were not produced. When\nthree nucleotides were inserted, the protein was synthesized and functional. This demonstrated that the amino acids must be\nspecified by groups of three nucleotides. These nucleotide triplets are called codons. The insertion of one or two nucleotides\ncompletely changed the triplet reading frame, thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid (Figure 15.5).\nThough insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation, the integrity of the rest of\nthe protein was maintained.\nScientists painstakingly solved the genetic code by translating synthetic mRNAs in vitro and sequencing the proteins they\nspecified (Figure 15.4).\nFigure 15.4 This figure shows the genetic code for translating each nucleotide triplet in mRNA into an amino acid or a termination signal in\na protein. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nIn addition to codons that instruct the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain, three of the 64 codons terminate\nprotein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery. These triplets are called nonsense codons, or stop\ncodons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as\nthe start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5' end of the\nmRNA. Following the start codon, the mRNA is read in groups of three until a stop codon is encountered.\nThe arrangement of the coding table reveals the structure of the code. There are sixteen \"blocks\" of codons, each specified by the\nfirst and second nucleotides of the codons within the block, e.g., the \"AC*\" block that corresponds to the amino acid threonine\n(Thr). Some blocks are divided into a pyrimidine half, in which the codon ends with U or C, and a purine half, in which the codon\nends with A or G. Some amino acids get a whole block of four codons, like alanine (Ala), threonine (Thr) and proline (Pro). Some\nget the pyrimidine half of their block, like histidine (His) and asparagine (Asn). Others get the purine half of their block, like\nglutamate (Glu) and lysine (Lys). Note that some amino acids get a block and a half-block for a total of six codons.\nThe specification of a single amino acid by multiple similar codons is called \"degeneracy.\" Degeneracy is believed to be a cellular\nmechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. Codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ\nby one nucleotide. In addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons. For example,\naspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu), which occupy the GA* block, are both negatively charged. This nuance of the genetic code\nensures that a single-nucleotide substitution mutation might specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar\namino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional.\n372\nChapter 15 \u2022 Genes and Proteins\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe genetic code is nearly universal. With a few minor exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein\nsynthesis. Conservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a\ntulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. That there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on\nEarth shares a common origin, especially considering that there are about 1084 possible combinations of 20 amino acids and 64\ntriplet codons.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTranscribe a gene and translate it to protein using complementary pairing and the genetic code at this site (http://openstax.org/\nl/create_protein) .\nFigure 15.5 The deletion of two nucleotides shifts the reading frame of an mRNA and changes the entire protein message, creating a\nnonfunctional protein or terminating protein synthesis altogether.\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION\nWhich Has More DNA: A Kiwi or a Strawberry?\nFigure 15.6 Do you think that a kiwi or a strawberry has more DNA per fruit? (credit \u201ckiwi\u201d: \"Kelbv\"/Flickr; credit: \u201cstrawberry\u201d: Alisdair\nMcDiarmid)\nQuestion: Would a kiwi and strawberry that are approximately the same size (Figure 15.6) also have approximately the same\namount of DNA?\nBackground: Genes are carried on chromosomes and are made of DNA. All mammals are diploid, meaning they have two copies\nof each chromosome. However, not all plants are diploid. The common strawberry is octoploid (8n) and the cultivated kiwi is\nhexaploid (6n). Research the total number of chromosomes in the cells of each of these fruits and think about how this might\ncorrespond to the amount of DNA in these fruits\u2019 cell nuclei. What other factors might contribute to the total amount of DNA in\na single fruit? Read about the technique of DNA isolation to understand how each step in the isolation protocol helps liberate\nand precipitate DNA.\nHypothesis: Hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference in DNA quantity from similarly sized strawberries\nand kiwis. Which fruit do you think would yield more DNA?\nTest your hypothesis: Isolate the DNA from a strawberry and a kiwi that are similarly sized. Perform the experiment in at least\ntriplicate for each fruit\n1.\nPrepare a bottle of DNA extraction buffer from 900 mL water, 50 mL dish detergent, and two teaspoons of table salt.

You should observe white, precipitated DNA.\n6.\nGather the DNA from each fruit by winding it around separate glass rods.\nRecord your observations: Because you are not quantitatively measuring DNA volume, you can record for each trial whether the\ntwo fruits produced the same or different amounts of DNA as observed by eye. If one or the other fruit produced noticeably\nmore DNA, record this as well. Determine whether your observations are consistent with several pieces of each fruit.\nAnalyze your data: Did you notice an obvious difference in the amount of DNA produced by each fruit? Were your results\nreproducible?\nDraw a conclusion: Given what you know about the number of chromosomes in each fruit, can you conclude that chromosome\nnumber necessarily correlates to DNA amount? Can you identify any drawbacks to this procedure? If you had access to a\nlaboratory, how could you standardize your comparison and make it more quantitative?\n15.2 Prokaryotic Transcription\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nList the different steps in prokaryotic transcription\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of promoters in prokaryotic transcription\n\u2022\nDescribe how and when transcription is terminated\nThe prokaryotes, which include Bacteria and Archaea, are mostly single-celled organisms that, by definition, lack membrane-\nbound nuclei and other organelles. A bacterial chromosome is a closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic chromosomes, is not\norganized around histone proteins. The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid region.\nIn addition, prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids, which are shorter, circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or\na few genes. Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits\nsuch as those involved with antibiotic resistance.\nTranscription in prokaryotes (and in eukaryotes) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA\nsynthesis. The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble. Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand\nfor each gene, which is called the template strand. The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost\nidentical to the other DNA strand, called the nontemplate strand, or the coding strand. The only nucleotide difference is that in\nmRNA, all of the T nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides (Figure 15.7). In an RNA double helix, A can bind U via two\nhydrogen bonds, just as in A\u2013T pairing in a DNA double helix.\nFigure 15.7 Messenger RNA is a copy of protein-coding information in the coding strand of DNA, with the substitution of U in the RNA for T\n374\nChapter 15 \u2022 Genes and Proteins\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nin the coding sequence. However, new RNA nucleotides base pair with the nucleotides of the template strand. RNA is synthesized in its\n5'-3' direction, using the enzyme RNA polymerase. As the template is read, the DNA unwinds ahead of the polymerase and then rewinds\nbehind it.\nThe nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed\nis called the +1 site, or the initiation site. Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are denoted with a \u201c-\u201d and are designated\nupstream nucleotides. Conversely, nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with \u201c+\u201d numbering and are called\ndownstream nucleotides.\nInitiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes\nProkaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei. Therefore, the processes of transcription, translation, and mRNA\ndegradation can all occur simultaneously. The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple\ntranscription and translation events that occur concurrently on the same DNA template. Prokaryotic genomes are very compact,\nand prokaryotic transcripts often cover more than one gene or cistron (a coding sequence for a single protein). Polycistronic\nmRNAs are then translated to produce more than one kind of protein.\nOur discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process in Escherichia coli, a well-studied eubacterial\nspecies. Although some differences exist between transcription in E. coli and transcription in archaea, an understanding of E.\ncoli transcription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species.\nProkaryotic RNA Polymerase\nProkaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. In E. coli, the polymerase is composed of five\npolypeptide subunits, two of which are identical. Four of these subunits, denoted \u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b2', comprise the polymerase core\nenzyme. These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is complete. Each\nsubunit has a unique role; the two \u03b1-subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the DNA; the \u03b2-subunit binds to the\nribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent mRNA molecule; and the \u03b2' subunit binds the DNA template\nstrand. The fifth subunit, \u03c3, is involved only in transcription initiation. It confers transcriptional specificity such that the\npolymerase begins to synthesize mRNA from an appropriate initiation site. Without \u03c3, the core enzyme would transcribe from\nrandom sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish. The polymerase comprised of all five\nsubunits is called the holoenzyme.\nProkaryotic Promoters\nA promoter is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery, including RNA polymerase, binds and initiates\ntranscription. In most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very\nimportant because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently.\nAlthough promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are evolutionarily conserved in many species. At the -10\nand -35 regions upstream of the initiation site, there are two promoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across\nall promoters and across various bacterial species (Figure 15.8). The -10 sequence, called the -10 region, has the consensus\nsequence TATAAT. The -35 sequence has the consensus sequence TTGACA. These consensus sequences are recognized and\nbound by \u03c3. Once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site. The A\u2013T-rich -10 region facilitates\nunwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made. The transcription initiation phase ends with the\nproduction of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released.\nFigure 15.8 The \u03c3 subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter region upstream of the\ntranscription start site. The \u03c3 subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription has been initiated.\n15.2 \u2022 Prokaryotic Transcription\n375\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView this MolecularMovies animation (http://openstax.org/l/transcription) to see the first part of transcription and the base\nsequence repetition of the TATA box.\nElongation and Termination in Prokaryotes\nThe transcription elongation phase begins with the release of the \u03c3 subunit from the polymerase. The dissociation of \u03c3 allows\nthe core enzyme to proceed along the DNA template, synthesizing mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of approximately 40\nnucleotides per second. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and rewound\nbehind it. The base pairing between DNA and RNA is not stable enough to maintain the stability of the mRNA synthesis\ncomponents. Instead, the RNA polymerase acts as a stable linker between the DNA template and the nascent RNA strands to\nensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely.\nProkaryotic Termination Signals\nOnce a gene is transcribed, the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the DNA template and liberate\nthe newly made mRNA. Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of termination signals. One is protein-\nbased and the other is RNA-based. Rho-dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein, which tracks along behind the\npolymerase on the growing mRNA chain. Near the end of the gene, the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the\nDNA template and it stalls. As a result, the rho protein collides with the polymerase. The interaction with rho releases the mRNA\nfrom the transcription bubble.\nRho-independent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the DNA template strand. As the polymerase nears the end\nof the gene being transcribed, it encounters a region rich in C\u2013G nucleotides. The mRNA folds back on itself, and the\ncomplementary C\u2013G nucleotides bind together. The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it\nbegins to transcribe a region rich in A\u2013T nucleotides. The complementary U\u2013A region of the mRNA transcript forms only a weak\ninteraction with the template DNA. This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, induces enough instability for the core enzyme to\nbreak away and liberate the new mRNA transcript.\nUpon termination, the process of transcription is complete. By the time termination occurs, the prokaryotic transcript would\nalready have been used to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur\nconcurrently. The unification of transcription, translation, and even mRNA degradation is possible because all of these\nprocesses occur in the same 5' to 3' direction, and because there is no membranous compartmentalization in the prokaryotic cell\n(Figure 15.9). In contrast, the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and translation.\nFigure 15.9 Multiple polymerases can transcribe a single bacterial gene while numerous ribosomes concurrently translate the mRNA\ntranscripts into polypeptides. In this way, a specific protein can rapidly reach a high concentration in the bacterial cell.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this BioStudio animation (http://openstax.org/l/transcription2) to see the process of prokaryotic transcription.\n376\nChapter 15 \u2022 Genes and Proteins\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n15.3 Eukaryotic Transcription\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nList the steps in eukaryotic transcription\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of RNA polymerases in transcription\n\u2022\nCompare and contrast the three RNA polymerases\n\u2022\nExplain the significance of transcription factors\nProkaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with a few key differences. The most\nimportant difference between prokaryote and eukaryote transcription is due to the latter\u2019s membrane-bound nucleus and\norganelles. With the genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic cell must be able to transport its mRNA to the cytoplasm and must\nprotect its mRNA from degrading before it is translated. Eukaryotes also employ three different polymerases that each\ntranscribe a different subset of genes. Eukaryotic mRNAs are usually monogenic, meaning that they specify a single protein.\nInitiation of Transcription in Eukaryotes\nUnlike the prokaryotic polymerase that can bind to a DNA template on its own, eukaryotes require several other proteins, called\ntranscription factors, to first bind to the promoter region and then to help recruit the appropriate polymerase.\nThe Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases\nThe features of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis are markedly more complex than those of prokaryotes. Instead of a single\npolymerase comprising five subunits, the eukaryotes have three polymerases that are each made up of 10 subunits or more. Each\neukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to the DNA template.\nRNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed,\nprocessed, and assembled into ribosomes (Table 15.1). The rRNA molecules are considered structural RNAs because they have a\ncellular role but are not translated into protein. The rRNAs are components of the ribosome and are essential to the process of\ntranslation. RNA polymerase I synthesizes all of the rRNAs from the tandemly duplicated set of 18S, 5.8S, and 28S ribosomal\ngenes. (Note that the \u201cS\u201d designation applies to \u201cSvedberg\u201d units, a nonadditive value that characterizes the speed at which a\nparticle sediments during centrifugation.)\nLocations, Products, and Sensitivities of the Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases\nRNA Polymerase\nCellular Compartment\nProduct of Transcription\n\u03b1-Amanitin Sensitivity\nI\nNucleolus\nAll rRNAs except 5S rRNA\nInsensitive\nII\nNucleus\nAll protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs\nExtremely sensitive\nIII\nNucleus\n5S rRNA, tRNAs, and small nuclear RNAs\nModerately sensitive\nTable 15.1\nRNA polymerase II is located in the nucleus and synthesizes all protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs. Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs\nundergo extensive processing after transcription but before translation. For clarity, this module\u2019s discussion of transcription\nand translation in eukaryotes will use the term \u201cmRNAs\u201d to describe only the mature, processed molecules that are ready to be\ntranslated. RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic genes.\nRNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus. This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S\npre-rRNA, transfer pre-RNAs (pre-tRNAs), and small nuclear pre-RNAs. The tRNAs have a critical role in translation; they serve\nas the \u201cadaptor molecules\u201d between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain. Small nuclear RNAs have a variety\nof functions, including \u201csplicing\u201d pre-mRNAs and regulating transcription factors.\nA scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase transcribes it by testing whether the gene is expressed in\nthe presence of \u03b1-amanitin, an oligopeptide toxin produced by the fly agaric toadstool mushroom and other species of Amanita.\nInterestingly, the \u03b1-amanitin affects the three polymerases very differently (Table 15.1). RNA polymerase I is completely\n15.3 \u2022 Eukaryotic Transcription\n377\ninsensitive to \u03b1-amanitin, meaning that the polymerase can transcribe DNA in vitro in the presence of this poison. RNA\npolymerase III is moderately sensitive to the toxin. In contrast, RNA polymerase II is extremely sensitive to \u03b1-amanitin. The\ntoxin prevents the enzyme from progressing down the DNA, and thus inhibits transcription. Knowing the transcribing\npolymerase can provide clues as to the general function of the gene being studied. Because RNA polymerase II transcribes the\nvast majority of genes, we will focus on this polymerase in our subsequent discussions about eukaryotic transcription factors\nand promoters.\nRNA Polymerase II Promoters and Transcription Factors\nEukaryotic promoters are much larger and more intricate than prokaryotic promoters. However, both have a sequence similar to\nthe -10 sequence of prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, this sequence is called the TATA box, and has the consensus sequence TATAAA\non the coding strand. It is located at -25 to -35 bases relative to the initiation (+1) site (Figure 15.10). This sequence is not identical\nto the E. coli -10 box, but it conserves the A\u2013T rich element. The thermostability of A\u2013T bonds is low and this helps the DNA\ntemplate to locally unwind in preparation for transcription.\nInstead of the simple \u03c3 factor that helps bind the prokaryotic RNA polymerase to its promoter, eukaryotes assemble a complex\nof transcription factors required to recruit RNA polymerase II to a protein coding gene. Transcription factors that bind to the\npromoter are called basal transcription factors. These basal factors are all called TFII (for Transcription Factor/polymerase II)\nplus an additional letter (A-J). The core complex is TFIID, which includes a TATA-binding protein (TBP). The other transcription\nfactors systematically fall into place on the DNA template, with each one further stabilizing the pre-initiation complex and\ncontributing to the recruitment of RNA polymerase II.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 15.10 A generalized promoter of a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II is shown. Transcription factors recognize the promoter.\nRNA polymerase II then binds and forms the transcription initiation complex.\nA scientist splices a eukaryotic promoter in front of a bacterial gene and inserts the gene in a bacterial chromosome. Would you\nexpect the bacteria to transcribe the gene?\nSome eukaryotic promoters also have a conserved CAAT box (GGCCAATCT) at approximately -80. Further upstream of the TATA\nbox, eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC-rich boxes (GGCG) or octamer boxes (ATTTGCAT). These elements\n378\nChapter 15 \u2022 Genes and Proteins\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nbind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more \u201cactive\u201d genes that\nare constantly being expressed by the cell.\nBasal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that subsequently\nrecruits RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation. The complexity of eukaryotic transcription does not end with the\npolymerases and promoters. An army of other transcription factors, which bind to upstream enhancers and silencers, also help\nto regulate the frequency with which pre-mRNA is synthesized from a gene. Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of\ntranscription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed.\nPromoter Structures for RNA Polymerases I and III\nThe processes of bringing RNA polymerases I and III to the DNA template involve slightly less complex collections of\ntranscription factors, but the general theme is the same.\nThe conserved promoter elements for genes transcribed by polymerases I and III differ from those transcribed by RNA\npolymerase II. RNA polymerase I transcribes genes that have two GC-rich promoter sequences in the -45 to +20 region. These\nsequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from\n-180 to -105 upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III\nhave upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves.\nEukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated process that requires a variety of proteins to interact with each other and with the\nDNA strand. Although the process of transcription in eukaryotes involves a greater metabolic investment than in prokaryotes, it\nensures that the cell transcribes precisely the pre-mRNAs that it needs for protein synthesis.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThe Evolution of Promoters\nThe evolution of genes may be a familiar concept. Mutations can occur in genes during DNA replication, and the result may or\nmay not be beneficial to the cell. By altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other factor, the process of mutation can\ntransform functions or physical features. However, eukaryotic promoters and other gene regulatory sequences may evolve as\nwell. For instance, consider a gene that, over many generations, becomes more valuable to the cell. Maybe the gene encodes a\nstructural protein that the cell needs to synthesize in abundance for a certain function. If this is the case, it would be beneficial\nto the cell for that gene\u2019s promoter to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene expression.\nScientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported varying results. In part, this is because it is difficult to\ninfer exactly where a eukaryotic promoter begins and ends. Some promoters occur within genes; others are located very far\nupstream, or even downstream, of the genes they are regulating. However, when researchers limited their examination to\nhuman core promoter sequences that were defined experimentally as sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found\nthat promoters evolve even faster than protein-coding genes.\nIt is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution of humans or other complex organisms. However,\nthe evolution of a promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product is an intriguing alternative to the evolution\nof the genes themselves.1\nEukaryotic Elongation and Termination\nFollowing the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is released from the other transcription factors, and\nelongation is allowed to proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction.\nAs discussed previously, RNA polymerase II transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so in this section we will focus on\nhow this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination.\nAlthough the enzymatic process of elongation is essentially the same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the DNA template is\nconsiderably more complex. When eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of DNA and proteins\ncalled chromatin. The DNA is tightly packaged around charged histone proteins at repeated intervals. These DNA\u2013histone\ncomplexes, collectively called nucleosomes, are regularly spaced and include 146 nucleotides of DNA wound around eight\n1H Liang et al., \u201cFast evolution of core promoters in primate genomes,\u201d Molecular Biology and Evolution 25 (2008): 1239\u201344.\n15.3 \u2022 Eukaryotic Transcription\n379\nhistones like thread around a spool.\nFor polynucleotide synthesis to occur, the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it\nencounters a nucleosome. This is accomplished by a special protein complex called FACT, which stands for \u201cfacilitates\nchromatin transcription.\u201d This complex pulls histones away from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it. Once the\npre-mRNA is synthesized, the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes.\nThe termination of transcription is different for the different polymerases. Unlike in prokaryotes, elongation by RNA polymerase\nII in eukaryotes takes place 1,000 to 2,000 nucleotides beyond the end of the gene being transcribed. This pre-mRNA tail is\nsubsequently removed by cleavage during mRNA processing. On the other hand, RNA polymerases I and III require termination\nsignals. Genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I contain a specific 18-nucleotide sequence that is recognized by a termination\nprotein. The process of termination in RNA polymerase III involves an mRNA hairpin similar to rho-independent termination of\ntranscription in prokaryotes.\n15.4 RNA Processing in Eukaryotes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the different steps in RNA processing\n\u2022\nUnderstand the significance of exons, introns, and splicing for mRNAs\n\u2022\nExplain how tRNAs and rRNAs are processed\nAfter transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNAs must undergo several processing steps before they can be translated. Eukaryotic\n(and prokaryotic) tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as components in the protein-synthesis\nmachinery.\nmRNA Processing\nThe eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes extensive processing before it is ready to be translated. Eukaryotic protein-coding\nsequences are not continuous, as they are in prokaryotes. The coding sequences (exons) are interrupted by noncoding introns,\nwhich must be removed to make a translatable mRNA. The additional steps involved in eukaryotic mRNA maturation also create\na molecule with a much longer half-life than a prokaryotic mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNAs last for several hours, whereas the typical\nE. coli mRNA lasts no more than five seconds.\nPre-mRNAs are first coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins; these protect the pre-mRNA from degradation while it is processed and\nexported out of the nucleus. The three most important steps of pre-mRNA processing are the addition of stabilizing and\nsignaling factors at the 5' and 3' ends of the molecule, and the removal of the introns (Figure 15.11). In rare cases, the mRNA\ntranscript can be \u201cedited\u201d after it is transcribed.\nFigure 15.11 Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be spliced out. A 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail are also added.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nRNA Editing in Trypanosomes\nThe trypanosomes are a group of protozoa that include the pathogen Trypanosoma brucei, which causes nagana in cattle and\nsleeping sickness in humans throughout great areas of Africa (Figure 15.12). The trypanosome is carried by biting flies in the\n380\nChapter 15 \u2022 Genes and Proteins\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ngenus Glossina (commonly called tsetse flies). Trypanosomes, and virtually all other eukaryotes, have organelles called\nmitochondria that supply the cell with chemical energy. Mitochondria are organelles that express their own DNA and are\nbelieved to be the remnants of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote and an engulfed prokaryote. The mitochondrial\nDNA of trypanosomes exhibit an interesting exception to the central dogma: their pre-mRNAs do not have the correct\ninformation to specify a functional protein. Usually, this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides. The cell\nperforms an additional RNA processing step called RNA editing to remedy this.\nFigure 15.12 Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans. The mRNAs of this pathogen must be modified by\nthe addition of nucleotides before protein synthesis can occur. (credit: modification of work by Torsten Ochsenreiter)\nOther genes in the mitochondrial genome encode 40- to 80-nucleotide guide RNAs. One or more of these molecules interacts by\ncomplementary base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the pre-mRNA transcript. However, the guide RNA has more A\nnucleotides than the pre-mRNA has U nucleotides with which to bind. In these regions, the guide RNA loops out. The 3' ends of\nguide RNAs have a long poly-U tail, and these U bases are inserted in regions of the pre-mRNA transcript at which the guide\nRNAs are looped. This process is entirely mediated by RNA molecules. That is, guide RNAs\u2014rather than proteins\u2014serve as the\ncatalysts in RNA editing.\nRNA editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes. In the mitochondria of some plants, almost all pre-mRNAs are edited.\nRNA editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats, rabbits, and even humans. What could be the evolutionary\nreason for this additional step in pre-mRNA processing? One possibility is that the mitochondria, being remnants of ancient\nprokaryotes, have an equally ancient RNA-based method for regulating gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, edits\nmade to pre-mRNAs differ depending on cellular conditions. Although speculative, the process of RNA editing may be a\nholdover from a primordial time when RNA molecules, instead of proteins, were responsible for catalyzing reactions.\n5' Capping\nWhile the pre-mRNA is still being synthesized, a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the growing transcript by a\nphosphate linkage. This functional group protects the nascent mRNA from degradation. In addition, factors involved in protein\nsynthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes.\n3' Poly-A Tail\nOnce elongation is complete, the pre-mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and a GU-\nrich sequence, leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre-mRNA. An enzyme called poly-A polymerase then adds a string of\napproximately 200 A residues, called the poly-A tail. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from degradation and is\nalso the binding site for a protein necessary for exporting the processed mRNA to the cytoplasm.\nPre-mRNA Splicing\nEukaryotic genes are composed of exons, which correspond to protein-coding sequences (ex-on signifies that they are\nexpressed), and intervening sequences called introns (int-ron denotes their intervening role), which may be involved in gene\nregulation but are removed from the pre-mRNA during processing. Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional\n15.4 \u2022 RNA Processing in Eukaryotes\n381\nproteins.\nThe discovery of introns came as a surprise to researchers in the 1970s who expected that pre-mRNAs would specify protein\nsequences without further processing, as they had observed in prokaryotes. The genes of higher eukaryotes very often contain\none or more introns. These regions may correspond to regulatory sequences; however, the biological significance of having many\nintrons or having very long introns in a gene is unclear. It is possible that introns slow down gene expression because it takes\nlonger to transcribe pre-mRNAs with lots of introns. Alternatively, introns may be nonfunctional sequence remnants left over\nfrom the fusion of ancient genes throughout the course of evolution. This is supported by the fact that separate exons often\nencode separate protein subunits or domains. For the most part, the sequences of introns can be mutated without ultimately\naffecting the protein product.\nAll of a pre-mRNA\u2019s introns must be completely and precisely removed before protein synthesis. If the process errs by even a\nsingle nucleotide, the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift, and the resulting protein would be dysfunctional. The\nprocess of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing (Figure 15.13). Introns are removed and degraded while\nthe pre-mRNA is still in the nucleus. Splicing occurs by a sequence-specific mechanism that ensures introns will be removed\nand exons rejoined with the accuracy and precision of a single nucleotide. Although the intron itself is noncoding, the beginning\nand end of each intron is marked with specific nucleotides: GU at the 5' end and AG at the 3' end of the intron. The splicing of\npre-mRNAs is conducted by complexes of proteins and RNA molecules called spliceosomes.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 15.13 Pre-mRNA splicing involves the precise removal of introns from the primary RNA transcript. The splicing process is catalyzed\nby protein complexes called spliceosomes that are composed of proteins and RNA molecules called small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs).\nSpliceosomes recognize sequences at the 5' and 3' end of the intron.\nErrors in splicing are implicated in cancers and other human diseases. What kinds of mutations might lead to splicing errors?\nThink of different possible outcomes if splicing errors occur.\nNote that more than 70 individual introns can be present, and each has to undergo the process of splicing\u2014in addition to 5'\ncapping and the addition of a poly-A tail\u2014just to generate a single, translatable mRNA molecule.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSee how introns are removed during RNA splicing at this website (http://openstax.org/l/RNA_splicing) .\n382\nChapter 15 \u2022 Genes and Proteins\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nProcessing of tRNAs and rRNAs\nThe tRNAs and rRNAs are structural molecules that have roles in protein synthesis; however, these RNAs are not themselves\ntranslated. Pre-rRNAs are transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes in the nucleolus. Pre-tRNAs are transcribed\nand processed in the nucleus and then released into the cytoplasm where they are linked to free amino acids for protein\nsynthesis.\nMost of the tRNAs and rRNAs in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are first transcribed as a long precursor molecule that spans\nmultiple rRNAs or tRNAs. Enzymes then cleave the precursors into subunits corresponding to each structural RNA. Some of the\nbases of pre-rRNAs are methylated; that is, a \u2013CH3 methyl functional group is added for stability. Pre-tRNA molecules also\nundergo methylation. As with pre-mRNAs, subunit excision occurs in eukaryotic pre-RNAs destined to become tRNAs or\nrRNAs.\nMature rRNAs make up approximately 50 percent of each ribosome. Some of a ribosome\u2019s RNA molecules are purely structural,\nwhereas others have catalytic or binding activities. Mature tRNAs take on a three-dimensional structure through local regions of\nbase pairing stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The tRNA folds to position the amino acid binding site at one end\nand the anticodon at the other end (Figure 15.14). The anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an\nmRNA codon through complementary base pairing.\nFigure 15.14 This is a space-filling model of a tRNA molecule that adds the amino acid phenylalanine to a growing polypeptide chain. The\nanticodon AAG binds the Codon UUC on the mRNA. The amino acid phenylalanine is attached to the other end of the tRNA.\n15.5 Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the different steps in protein synthesis\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of ribosomes in protein synthesis\nThe synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell\u2019s energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins account for more\nmass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually every function\nof a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into a polypeptide product.\nAmino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 to more\n15.5 \u2022 Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis\n383\nthan 1000 amino acid residues. Each individual amino acid has an amino group (NH2) and a carboxyl (COOH) group.\nPolypeptides are formed when the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide) bond with the carboxyl group\nof another amino acid (Figure 15.15). This reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates one water molecule.\nFigure 15.15 A peptide bond links the carboxyl end of one amino acid with the amino end of another, producing one water molecule during\nthe process. For simplicity in this image, only the functional groups involved in the peptide bond are shown. The R and R' designations refer\nto the rest of each amino acid structure.\nThe Protein Synthesis Machinery\nIn addition to the mRNA template, many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation. The\ncomposition of each component may vary across species; for example, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of rRNAs\nand polypeptides depending on the organism. However, the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis machinery\nare comparable from bacteria to human cells. Translation requires the input of an mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and\nvarious enzymatic factors. (Note: A ribosome can be thought of as an enzyme whose amino acid binding sites are specified by\nmRNA.)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick through the steps of this PBS interactive (http://openstax.org/l/prokary_protein) to see protein synthesis in action.\nRibosomes\nEven before an mRNA is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes. In E. coli, there are between 10,000\nand 70,000 ribosomes present in each cell at any given time. A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural\nand catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides. In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis\nand assembly of rRNAs.\nRibosomes exist in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes.\nMitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more similar to prokaryotic\nribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the cytoplasm.\nRibosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the\ninitiation of translation. In E. coli, the small subunit is described as 30S, and the large subunit is 50S, for a total of 70S (recall\nthat Svedberg units are not additive). Mammalian ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit, for a total of\n80S. The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template, whereas the large subunit sequentially binds tRNAs. Each\nmRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same direction: reading the\nmRNA from 5' to 3' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus. The complete mRNA/poly-\nribosome structure is called a polysome.\ntRNAs\nThe tRNAs are structural RNA molecules that were transcribed from genes by RNA polymerase III. Depending on the species, 40\nto 60 types of tRNAs exist in the cytoplasm. Transfer RNAs serve as adaptor molecules. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid\nand recognizes one or more of the mRNA codons that define the order of amino acids in a protein. Aminoacyl-tRNAs bind to the\nribosome and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that actually\n384\nChapter 15 \u2022 Genes and Proteins\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\u201ctranslate\u201d the language of RNA into the language of proteins.\nOf the 64 possible mRNA codons\u2014or triplet combinations of A, U, G, and C\u2014three specify the termination of protein synthesis\nand 61 specify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. Of these 61, one codon (AUG) also encodes the initiation of\ntranslation. Each tRNA anticodon can base pair with one or more of the mRNA codons for its amino acid. For instance, if the\nsequence CUA occurred on an mRNA template in the proper reading frame, it would bind a leucine tRNA expressing the\ncomplementary sequence, GAU. The ability of some tRNAs to match more than one codon is what gives the genetic code its\nblocky structure.\nAs the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a small package.\nConsider that tRNAs need to interact with three factors: 1) they must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase (see\nbelow); 2) they must be recognized by ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mRNA.\nAminoacyl tRNA Synthetases\nThe process of pre-tRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the RNA portion of the adaptor molecule. The\ncorresponding amino acid must be added later, once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm. Through the process\nof tRNA \u201ccharging,\u201d each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by one of a group of enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA\nsynthetases. At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the exact number of\naminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species. These enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP to catalyze a high-energy bond\nbetween an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (AMP); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this reaction. The\nactivated amino acid is then transferred to the tRNA, and AMP is released. The term \"charging\" is appropriate, since the high-\nenergy bond that attaches an amino acid to its tRNA is later used to drive the formation of the peptide bond. Each tRNA is\nnamed for its amino acid.\nThe Mechanism of Protein Synthesis\nAs with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. The\nprocess of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we\u2019ll explore how translation occurs in E. coli, a\nrepresentative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.\nInitiation of Translation\nProtein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In E. coli, this complex involves the small 30S ribosome,\nthe mRNA template, three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a special initiator tRNA, called tRNAMetf.\nIn E. coli mRNA, a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG), interacts with\nthe rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome. This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on\nthe mRNA template. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy source during\ntranslation\u2014both at the start of elongation and during the ribosome\u2019s translocation. Binding of the mRNA to the 30S ribosome\nalso requires IF-III.\nThe initiator tRNA then interacts with the start codon AUG (or rarely, GUG). This tRNA carries the amino acid methionine,\nwhich is formylated after its attachment to the tRNA. The formylation creates a \"faux\" peptide bond between the formyl carboxyl\ngroup and the amino group of the methionine. Binding of the fMet-tRNAMetf is mediated by the initiation factor IF-2. The fMet\nbegins every polypeptide chain synthesized by E. coli, but it is usually removed after translation is complete. When an in-frame\nAUG is encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met-tRNAMet. After\nthe formation of the initiation complex, the 30S ribosomal subunit is joined by the 50S subunit to form the translation complex.\nIn eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mRNA, the 40S small ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic IFs, and\nnucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP). The methionine on the charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNAi, is not formylated.\nHowever, Met-tRNAi is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.\nInstead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap\nat the 5' end of the mRNA. A cap-binding protein (CBP) and several other IFs assist the movement of the ribosome to the 5' cap.\nOnce at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the AUG start codon. Many\neukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG, but this is not always the case. According to Kozak\u2019s rules, the nucleotides\naround the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon. Kozak\u2019s rules state that the following consensus sequence must\nappear around the AUG of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccRccAUGG-3'. The R (for purine) indicates a site that can be either A or G, but\ncannot be C or U. Essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the efficiency of translation.\n15.5 \u2022 Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis\n385\nOnce the appropriate AUG is identified, the other proteins and CBP dissociate, and the 60S subunit binds to the complex of\nMet-tRNAi, mRNA, and the 40S subunit. This step completes the initiation of translation in eukaryotes.\nTranslation, Elongation, and Termination\nIn prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of elongation are the same, so we will review elongation from the perspective of E.\ncoli. When the translation complex is formed, the tRNA binding region of the ribosome consists of three compartments. The A\n(aminoacyl) site binds incoming charged aminoacyl tRNAs. The P (peptidyl) site binds charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that\nhave formed peptide bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA.\nThe E (exit) site releases dissociated tRNAs so that they can be recharged with free amino acids. The initiating methionyl-tRNA,\nhowever, occupies the P site at the beginning of the elongation phase of translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.\nDuring translation elongation, the mRNA template provides tRNA binding specificity. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA,\neach mRNA codon comes into register, and specific binding with the corresponding charged tRNA anticodon is ensured. If\nmRNA were not present in the elongation complex, the ribosome would bind tRNAs nonspecifically and randomly (?).\nElongation proceeds with charged tRNAs sequentially entering and leaving the ribosome as each new amino acid is added to the\npolypeptide chain. Movement of a tRNA from A to P to E site is induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome\nby three bases in the 3' direction. The energy for each step along the ribosome is donated by elongation factors that hydrolyze\nGTP. GTP energy is required both for the binding of a new aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site and for its translocation to the P site\nafter formation of the peptide bond. Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A-site\ntRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the P-site tRNA. The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by\npeptidyl transferase, an RNA-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit. The energy for each peptide bond\nformation is derived from the high-energy bond linking each amino acid to its tRNA. After peptide bond formation, the A-site\ntRNA that now holds the growing peptide chain moves to the P site, and the P-site tRNA that is now empty moves to the E site\nand is expelled from the ribosome (Figure 15.16). Amazingly, the E. coli translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add\neach amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino-acid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds.\n386\nChapter 15 \u2022 Genes and Proteins\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 15.16 Translation begins when an initiator tRNA anticodon recognizes a start codon on mRNA bound to a small ribosomal subunit.\nThe large ribosomal subunit joins the small subunit, and a second tRNA is recruited. As the mRNA moves relative to the ribosome,\nsuccessive tRNAs move through the ribosome and the polypeptide chain is formed. Entry of a release factor into the A site terminates\ntranslation and the components dissociate.\nMany antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. For example, tetracycline blocks the A site on the bacterial ribosome, and\nchloramphenicol blocks peptidyl transfer. What specific effect would you expect each of these antibiotics to have on protein\nsynthesis?\nTetracycline would directly affect:\na.\ntRNA binding to the ribosome\nb.\nribosome assembly\nc.\ngrowth of the protein chain\nChloramphenicol would directly affect:\na.\ntRNA binding to the ribosome\nb.\nribosome assembly\nc.\ngrowth of the protein chain\nTermination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered. Upon aligning with the A site,\nthese nonsense codons are recognized by protein release factors that resemble tRNAs. The releasing factors in both prokaryotes\nand eukaryotes instruct peptidyl transferase to add a water molecule to the carboxyl end of the P-site amino acid. This reaction\nforces the P-site amino acid to detach from its tRNA, and the newly made protein is released. The small and large ribosomal\nsubunits dissociate from the mRNA and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation\n15.5 \u2022 Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis\n387\ninitiation complex. After many ribosomes have completed translation, the mRNA is degraded so the nucleotides can be reused\nin another transcription reaction.\nProtein Folding, Modification, and Targeting\nDuring and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically modified, signal sequences appended, and the new\nprotein \u201cfolded\u201d into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions. A signal sequence is a\nshort sequence at the amino end of a protein that directs it to a specific cellular compartment. These sequences can be thought\nof as the protein\u2019s \u201ctrain ticket\u201d to its ultimate destination, and are recognized by signal-recognition proteins that act as\nconductors. For instance, a specific signal sequence terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts (in\nplants). Once the protein reaches its cellular destination, the signal sequence is usually clipped off.\nMany proteins fold spontaneously, but some proteins require helper molecules, called chaperones, to prevent them from\naggregating during the complicated process of folding. Even if a protein is properly specified by its corresponding mRNA, it\ncould take on a completely dysfunctional shape if abnormal temperature or pH conditions prevent it from folding correctly.\n388\nChapter 15 \u2022 Genes and Proteins\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\n7-methylguanosine cap\nmodification added to the 5' end of\npre-mRNAs to protect mRNA from degradation and\nassist translation\naminoacyl tRNA synthetase\nenzyme that \u201ccharges\u201d tRNA\nmolecules by catalyzing a bond between the tRNA and a\ncorresponding amino acid\nanticodon\nthree-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA molecule\nthat corresponds to an mRNA codon\nCAAT box\n(GGCCAATCT) essential eukaryotic promoter\nsequence involved in binding transcription factors\ncentral dogma\nstates that genes specify the sequence of\nmRNAs, which in turn specify the sequence of proteins\ncodon\nthree consecutive nucleotides in mRNA that specify\nthe insertion of an amino acid or the release of a\npolypeptide chain during translation\ncolinear\nin terms of RNA and protein, three \u201cunits\u201d of RNA\n(nucleotides) specify one \u201cunit\u201d of protein (amino acid) in\na consecutive fashion\nconsensus\nDNA sequence that is used by many species to\nperform the same or similar functions\ncore enzyme\nprokaryotic RNA polymerase consisting of \u03b1,\n\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b2' but missing \u03c3;

The prokaryotic\npolymerase consists of a core enzyme of four protein\nsubunits and a \u03c3 protein that assists only with initiation.\nElongation synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a\nrate of 40 nucleotides per second. Termination liberates the\nmRNA and occurs either by rho protein interaction or by the\nformation of an mRNA hairpin.\n15.3 Eukaryotic Transcription\nTranscription in eukaryotes involves one of three types of\npolymerases, depending on the gene being transcribed. RNA\npolymerase II transcribes all of the protein-coding genes,\nwhereas RNA polymerase I transcribes the tandemly\nduplicated rRNA genes, and RNA polymerase III transcribes\nvarious small RNAs, like the 5S rRNA, tRNA, and small\nnuclear RNA genes. The initiation of transcription in\neukaryotes involves the binding of several transcription\nfactors to complex promoter sequences that are usually\nlocated upstream of the gene being copied. The mRNA is\nsynthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, and the FACT complex\nmoves and reassembles nucleosomes as the polymerase\npasses by. Whereas RNA polymerases I and III terminate\ntranscription by protein- or RNA hairpin-dependent\nmethods, RNA polymerase II transcribes for 1,000 or more\nnucleotides beyond the gene template and cleaves the excess\nduring pre-mRNA processing.\n15.4 RNA Processing in Eukaryotes\nEukaryotic pre-mRNAs are modified with a 5'\nmethylguanosine cap and a poly-A tail. These structures\nprotect the mature mRNA from degradation and help export\nit from the nucleus. Pre-mRNAs also undergo splicing, in\nwhich introns are removed and exons are reconnected with\nsingle-nucleotide accuracy. Only finished mRNAs that have\nundergone 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and intron splicing\nare exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Pre-rRNAs\nand pre-tRNAs may be processed by intramolecular cleavage,\nsplicing, methylation, and chemical conversion of\nnucleotides. Rarely, RNA editing is also performed to insert\nmissing bases after an mRNA has been synthesized.\n15.5 Ribosomes and Protein\nSynthesis\nThe players in translation include the mRNA template,\nribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors. The small\nribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA template either at the\nShine-Dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or the 5' cap\n(eukaryotes). Translation begins at the initiating AUG on the\nmRNA, specifying methionine. The formation of peptide\nbonds occurs between sequential amino acids matched to\nthe mRNA template by their tRNAs according to the genetic\ncode. Charged tRNAs enter the ribosomal A site, and their\namino acid bonds with the amino acid at the P site. The\nentire mRNA is translated in three-nucleotide \u201csteps\u201d of the\nribosome. When a nonsense codon is encountered, a release\nfactor binds and dissociates the components and frees the\nnew protein. Folding of the protein occurs during and after\ntranslation.\n390\nChapter 15 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

The control of which genes are expressed dictates whether a cell is,\nfor example, (a) an eye cell or (b) a liver cell. It is the differential gene expression patterns that\narise in different cells that give rise to (c) a complete organism.\nINTRODUCTION Each somatic cell in the body generally contains the same DNA. A few exceptions\ninclude red blood cells, which contain no DNA in their mature state, and some immune system cells that\nrearrange their DNA while producing antibodies. In general, however, the genes that determine whether\nyou have green eyes, brown hair, and how fast you metabolize food are the same in the cells in your eyes\nand your liver, even though these organs function quite differently. If each cell has the same DNA, how is\nit that cells or organs are different? Why do cells in the eye differ so dramatically from cells in the liver?\nWhereas each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence, each cell does not turn on, or express, the\nsame set of genes. Each cell type needs a different set of proteins to perform its function. Therefore, only\na small subset of proteins is expressed in a cell. For the proteins to be expressed, the DNA must be\ntranscribed into RNA and the RNA must be translated into protein. In a given cell type, not all genes\nencoded in the DNA are transcribed into RNA or translated into protein because specific cells in our body\nhave specific functions. Specialized proteins that make up the eye (iris, lens, and cornea) are only\nexpressed in the eye, whereas the specialized proteins in the heart (pacemaker cells, heart muscle, and\nvalves) are only expressed in the heart. At any given time, only a subset of all of the genes encoded by our\nDNA are expressed and translated into proteins. The expression of specific genes is a highly regulated\nprocess with many levels and stages of control. This complexity ensures the proper expression in the\nproper cell at the proper time.\nChapter Outline\n16.1 Regulation of Gene\nExpression\n16.2 Prokaryotic Gene\nRegulation\n16.3 Eukaryotic\nEpigenetic Gene\nRegulation\n16.4 Eukaryotic\nTranscription Gene\nRegulation\n16.5 Eukaryotic Post-\ntranscriptional\nGene Regulation\n16.6 Eukaryotic\nTranslational and\nPost-translational\nGene Regulation\n16.7 Cancer and Gene\nRegulation\n16.1 Regulation of Gene Expression\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss why every cell does not express all of its genes all of the time\n\u2022\nDescribe how prokaryotic gene regulation occurs at the transcriptional level\n\u2022\nDiscuss how eukaryotic gene regulation occurs at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-\ntranscriptional, translational, and post-translational levels\nFor a cell to function properly, necessary proteins must be synthesized at the proper time and place. All cells\ncontrol or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA. The process of turning\non a gene to produce RNA and protein is called gene expression. Whether in a simple unicellular organism\nor a complex multi-cellular organism, each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed. For this to\noccur, there must be internal chemical mechanisms that control when a gene is expressed to make RNA and\nprotein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no\nlonger needed.\nThe regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space. It would require a significant amount of\nenergy for an organism to express every gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes\nonly when they are required. In addition, only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because\nDNA must be unwound from its tightly coiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA. Cells would\nhave to be enormous if every protein were expressed in every cell all the time.\nThe control of gene expression is extremely complex. Malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell\nand can lead to the development of many diseases, including cancer.\nProkaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression\nTo understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional\nprotein in a cell. The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different\nmanners.\nProkaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus, and their DNA therefore floats\nfreely in the cell cytoplasm. To synthesize a protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur\nalmost simultaneously. When the resulting protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. As a result, the\nprimary method to control what type of protein and how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic\ncell is the regulation of DNA transcription. All of the subsequent steps occur automatically. When more\nprotein is required, more transcription occurs. Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression\nis mostly at the transcriptional level.\nEukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity. In eukaryotic cells,\nthe DNA is contained inside the cell\u2019s nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA. The newly synthesized\nRNA is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the RNA into\nprotein. The processes of transcription and translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane;\ntranscription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation occurs only outside the nucleus in the\ncytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process (Figure 16.2). Regulation\nmay occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors\n(epigenetic level), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptional level), when the RNA is processed and\nexported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed (post-transcriptional level), when the RNA is translated into\nprotein (translational level), or after the protein has been made (post-translational level).\n396\nChapter 16 \u2022 Gene Expression\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 16.2 Regulation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotic transcription and translation occur simultaneously in the cytoplasm, and\nregulation occurs at the transcriptional level. Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated during transcription and RNA processing, which take\nplace in the nucleus, and during protein translation, which takes place in the cytoplasm. Further regulation may occur through post-\ntranslational modifications of proteins.\nThe differences in the regulation of gene expression between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are summarized in Table 16.1. The\nregulation of gene expression is discussed in detail in subsequent modules.\nDifferences in the Regulation of Gene Expression of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Organisms\nProkaryotic organisms\nEukaryotic organisms\nLack a membrane-bound nucleus\nContain nucleus\nDNA is found in the cytoplasm\nDNA is confined to the nuclear compartment\nRNA transcription and protein\nformation occur almost\nsimultaneously\nRNA transcription occurs prior to protein formation, and it takes place in the\nnucleus. Translation of RNA to protein occurs in the cytoplasm.\nGene expression is regulated\nprimarily at the transcriptional level\nGene expression is regulated at many levels (epigenetic, transcriptional, nuclear\nshuttling, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational)\nTable 16.1\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nEvolution of Gene Regulation\nProkaryotic cells can only regulate gene expression by controlling the amount of transcription. As eukaryotic cells evolved, the\ncomplexity of the control of gene expression increased. For example, with the evolution of eukaryotic cells came\ncompartmentalization of important cellular components and cellular processes. A nuclear region that contains the DNA was\nformed. Transcription and translation were physically separated into two different cellular compartments. It therefore became\npossible to control gene expression by regulating transcription in the nucleus, and also by controlling the RNA levels and protein\ntranslation present outside the nucleus.\nMost gene regulation is done to conserve cell resources. However, other regulatory processes may be defensive. Cellular\nprocesses such as developed to protect the cell from viral or parasitic infections. If the cell could quickly shut off gene expression\nfor a short period of time, it would be able to survive an infection when other organisms could not. Therefore, the organism\n16.1 \u2022 Regulation of Gene Expression\n397\nevolved a new process that helped it survive, and it was able to pass this new development to offspring.\n16.2 Prokaryotic Gene Regulation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the steps involved in prokaryotic gene regulation\n\u2022\nExplain the roles of activators, inducers, and repressors in gene regulation\nThe DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome, supercoiled within the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm.\nProteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in\nblocks called operons. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the\nlactose (or lac) operon, and transcribed into a single mRNA.\nIn prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors,\nactivators, and inducers. Repressors and activators are proteins produced in the cell. Both repressors and activators regulate\ngene expression by binding to specific DNA sites adjacent to the genes they control. In general, activators bind to the promoter\nsite, while repressors bind to operator regions. Repressors prevent transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus,\nwhereas activators increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Inducers are small molecules that\nmay be produced by the cell or that are in the cell\u2019s environment. Inducers either activate or repress transcription depending on\nthe needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.\nThe trp Operon: A Repressible Operon\nBacteria such as Escherichia coli need amino acids to survive, and are able to synthesize many of them. Tryptophan is one such\namino acid that E. coli can either ingest from the environment or synthesize using enzymes that are encoded by five genes.\nThese five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan (trp) operon (Figure 16.3). The genes are transcribed into\na single mRNA, which is then translated to produce all five enzymes. If tryptophan is present in the environment, then E. coli\ndoes not need to synthesize it and the trp operon is switched off. However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch\ncontrolling the operon is turned on, the mRNA is transcribed, the enzyme proteins are translated, and tryptophan is\nsynthesized.\nFigure 16.3 The tryptophan operon. The five genes that are needed to synthesize tryptophan in E. coli are located next to each other in the\ntrp operon. When tryptophan is plentiful, two tryptophan molecules bind the repressor protein at the operator sequence. This physically\nblocks the RNA polymerase from transcribing the tryptophan genes. When tryptophan is absent, the repressor protein does not bind to the\noperator and the genes are transcribed.\nThe trp operon includes three important regions: the coding region, the trp operator and the trp promoter. The coding region\n398\nChapter 16 \u2022 Gene Expression\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nincludes the genes for the five tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes. Just before the coding region is the transcriptional start site.\nThe promoter sequence, to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription, is before or \u201cupstream\u201d of the transcriptional\nstart site. Between the promoter and the transcriptional start site is the operator region.\nThe trp operator contains the DNA code to which the trp repressor protein can bind. However, the repressor alone cannot bind\nto the operator. When tryptophan is present in the cell, two tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor, which changes the\nshape of the repressor protein to a form that can bind to the trp operator. Binding of the tryptophan\u2013repressor complex at the\noperator physically prevents the RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and transcribing the downstream genes.\nWhen tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator, the polymerase can transcribe\nthe enzyme genes, and tryptophan is synthesized. Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes\nturned off, the trp operon is said to be negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression\nare negative regulators.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video to learn more about the trp operon.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/trp_operon)\nCatabolite Activator Protein (CAP): A Transcriptional Activator\nJust as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the promoter sequences\nthat act as positive regulators to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce, E. coli bacteria can turn\nto other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate sugars must be transcribed. When glucose levels\ndrop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose\nand energy metabolism in E. coli. Accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator protein (CAP), a\nprotein that binds to the promoters of operons which control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the\ncomplex then binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources (Figure 16.4). In these\noperons, a CAP-binding site is located upstream of the RNA-polymerase-binding site in the promoter. CAP binding stabilizes\nthe binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and increases transcription of the associated protein-coding genes.\nFigure 16.4 Transcriptional activation by the CAP protein. When glucose levels fall, E. coli may use other sugars for fuel but must transcribe\nnew genes to do so. As glucose supplies become limited, cAMP levels increase. This cAMP binds to the CAP protein, a positive regulator\nthat binds to a promoter region upstream of the genes required to use other sugar sources.\nThe lac Operon: An Inducible Operon\nThe third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons, which have proteins that bind to activate\nor repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. The lac operon is a typical inducible\noperon. As mentioned previously, E. coli is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations are low. One\n16.2 \u2022 Prokaryotic Gene Regulation\n399\nsuch sugar source is lactose. The lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local\nenvironment. The Z gene of the lac operon encodes beta-galactosidase, which breaks lactose down to glucose and galactose.\nHowever, for the lac operon to be activated, two conditions must be met. First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-\nexistent. Second, lactose must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the lac operon be transcribed\n(Figure 16.5). In the absence of glucose, the binding of the CAP protein makes transcription of the lac operon more effective.\nWhen lactose is present, its metabolite, allolactose, binds to the lac repressor and changes its shape so that it cannot bind to the\nlac operator to prevent transcription. This combination of conditions makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically\nwasteful to synthesize the enzymes to process lactose if glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available. It should be\nmentioned that the lac operon is transcribed at a very low rate even when glucose is present and lactose absent.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 16.5 Regulation of the lac operon. Transcription of the lac operon is carefully regulated so that its expression only occurs when\nglucose is limited and lactose is present to serve as an alternative fuel source.\nIn E. coli, the trp operon is on by default, while the lac operon is off. Why do you think this is the case?\nIf glucose is present, then CAP fails to bind to the promoter sequence to activate transcription. If lactose is absent, then the\nrepressor binds to the operator to prevent transcription. If either of these conditions is met, then transcription remains off.\nOnly when glucose is absent and lactose is present is the lac operon transcribed (Table 16.2).\n400\nChapter 16 \u2022 Gene Expression\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nSignals that Induce or Repress Transcription of the lac Operon\nGlucose\nCAP binds\nLactose\nRepressor binds\nTranscription\n+\n-\n-\n+\nNo\n+\n-\n+\n-\nSome\n-\n+\n-\n+\nNo\n-\n+\n+\n-\nYes\nTable 16.2\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch an animated tutorial about the workings of lac operon here.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/lac_operon)\n16.3 Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how chromatin remodeling controls transcriptional access\n\u2022\nDescribe how access to DNA is controlled by histone modification\n\u2022\nDescribe how DNA methylation is related to epigenetic gene changes\nEukaryotic gene expression is more complex than prokaryotic gene expression because the processes of transcription and\ntranslation are physically separated. Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells can regulate gene expression at many different\nlevels. Epigenetic changes are inheritable changes in gene expression that do not result from changes in the DNA sequence.\nEukaryotic gene expression begins with control of access to the DNA. Transcriptional access to the DNA can be controlled in two\ngeneral ways: chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation. Chromatin remodeling changes the way that DNA is associated\nwith chromosomal histones. DNA methylation is associated with developmental changes and gene silencing.\nEpigenetic Control: Regulating Access to Genes within the Chromosome\nThe human genome encodes over 20,000 genes, with hundreds to thousands of genes on each of the 23 human chromosomes.\nThe DNA in the nucleus is precisely wound, folded, and compacted into chromosomes so that it will fit into the nucleus. It is also\norganized so that specific segments can be accessed as needed by a specific cell type.\nThe first level of organization, or packing, is the winding of DNA strands around histone proteins. Histones package and order\nDNA into structural units called nucleosome complexes, which can control the access of proteins to the DNA regions (Figure\n16.6a). Under the electron microscope, this winding of DNA around histone proteins to form nucleosomes looks like small beads\non a string (Figure 16.6b).\n16.3 \u2022 Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation\n401\nFigure 16.6 DNA is folded around histone proteins to create (a) nucleosome complexes. These nucleosomes control the access of proteins\nto the underlying DNA. When viewed through an electron microscope (b), the nucleosomes look like beads on a string. (credit \u201cmicrograph\u201d:\nmodification of work by Chris Woodcock)\nThese beads (histone proteins) can move along the string (DNA) to expose different sections of the molecule. If DNA encoding a\nspecific gene is to be transcribed into RNA, the nucleosomes surrounding that region of DNA can slide down the DNA to open\nthat specific chromosomal region and allow for the transcriptional machinery (RNA polymerase) to initiate transcription (Figure\n16.7).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 16.7 Nucleosomes can slide along DNA. When nucleosomes are spaced closely together (top), transcription factors cannot bind and\ngene expression is turned off. When the nucleosomes are spaced far apart (bottom), the DNA is exposed. Transcription factors can bind,\nallowing gene expression to occur. Modifications to the histones and DNA affect nucleosome spacing.\nIn females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated during embryonic development because of epigenetic changes to the\nchromatin. What impact do you think these changes would have on nucleosome packing?\n402\nChapter 16 \u2022 Gene Expression\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nHow closely the histone proteins associate with the DNA is regulated by signals found on both the histone proteins and on the\nDNA. These signals are functional groups added to histone proteins or to DNA and determine whether a chromosomal region\nshould be open or closed (Figure 16.8 depicts modifications to histone proteins and DNA). These tags are not permanent, but\nmay be added or removed as needed. Some chemical groups (phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups) are attached to specific amino\nacids in histone \"tails\" at the N-terminus of the protein. These groups do not alter the DNA base sequence, but they do alter how\ntightly wound the DNA is around the histone proteins. DNA is a negatively charged molecule and unmodified histones are\npositively charged; therefore, changes in the charge of the histone will change how tightly wound the DNA molecule will be. By\nadding chemical modifications like acetyl groups, the charge becomes less positive, and the binding of DNA to the histones is\nrelaxed. Altering the location of nucleosomes and the tightness of histone binding opens some regions of chromatin to\ntranscription and closes others.\nThe DNA molecule itself can also be modified by methylation. DNA methylation occurs within very specific regions called CpG\nislands. These are stretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA pairs (CG) found in the promoter\nregions of genes. The cytosine member of the CG pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added). Methylated genes are usually\nsilenced, although methylation may have other regulatory effects. In some cases, genes that are silenced during the\ndevelopment of the gametes of one parent are transmitted in their silenced condition to the offspring. Such genes are said to be\nimprinted. Parental diet or other environmental conditions may also affect the methylation patterns of genes, which in turn\nmodifies gene expression. Changes in chromatin organization interact with DNA methylation. DNA methyltransferases appear\nto be attracted to chromatin regions with specific histone modifications. Highly methylated (hypermethylated) DNA regions\nwith deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally inactive.\nFigure 16.8 Histone proteins and DNA nucleotides can be modified chemically. Modifications affect nucleosome spacing and gene\nexpression. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nEpigenetic changes are not permanent, although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division and may even cross\ngenerational lines. Chromatin remodeling alters the chromosomal structure (open or closed) as needed. If a gene is to be\ntranscribed, the histone proteins and DNA in the chromosomal region encoding that gene are modified in a way that opens the\npromoter region to allow RNA polymerase and other proteins, called transcription factors, to bind and initiate transcription. If\na gene is to remain turned off, or silenced, the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed\nchromosomal configuration. In this closed configuration, the RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access to\nthe DNA and transcription cannot occur (Figure 16.8).\n16.3 \u2022 Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation\n403\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView this video that describes how epigenetic regulation controls gene expression.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/epigenetic_reg)\n16.4 Eukaryotic Transcription Gene Regulation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of transcription factors in gene regulation\n\u2022\nExplain how enhancers and repressors regulate gene expression\nLike prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the action of an RNA polymerase to bind to a DNA\nsequence upstream of a gene in order to initiate transcription. However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA\npolymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. RNA polymerase by itself\ncannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells. There are two types of transcription factors that regulate eukaryotic\ntranscription: General (or basal) transcription factors bind to the core promoter region to assist with the binding of RNA\npolymerase. Specific transcription factors bind to various regions outside of the core promoter region and interact with the\nproteins at the core promoter to enhance or repress the activity of the polymerase.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView the process of transcription\u2014the making of RNA from a DNA template.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/transcript_RNA)\nThe Promoter and the Transcription Machinery\nGenes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier. The promoter region is immediately upstream of the coding\nsequence. This region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long (hundreds of nucleotides long). The longer the\npromoter, the more available space for proteins to bind. This also adds more control to the transcription process. The length of\nthe promoter is gene-specific and can differ dramatically between genes. Consequently, the level of control of gene expression\ncan also differ quite dramatically between genes. The purpose of the promoter is to bind transcription factors that control the\ninitiation of transcription.\nWithin the core promoter region, 25 to 35 bases upstream of the transcriptional start site, resides the TATA box. The TATA box\nhas the consensus sequence of 5\u2019-TATAAA-3\u2019. The TATA box is the binding site for a protein complex called TFIID, which contains\na TATA-binding protein. Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Some\nof these transcription factors help to bind the RNA polymerase to the promoter, and others help to activate the transcription\ninitiation complex.\nIn addition to the TATA box, other binding sites are found in some promoters. Some biologists prefer to restrict the range of the\neukaryotic promoter to the core promoter, or polymerase binding site, and refer to these additional sites as promoter-proximal\nelements, because they are usually found within a few hundred base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. Examples of\nthese elements are the CAAT box, with the consensus sequence 5\u2019-CCAAT-3\u2019 and the GC box, with the consensus sequence 5\u2019-\nGGGCGG-3\u2019. Specific transcription factors can bind to these promoter-proximal elements to regulate gene transcription. A\ngiven gene may have its own combination of these specific transcription-factor binding sites. There are hundreds of\ntranscription factors in a cell, each of which binds specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif. When transcription factors\nbind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as a cis-acting element, because it is on the same\nchromosome just next to the gene. Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their\nbinding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed.\nEnhancers and Transcription\nIn some eukaryotic genes, there are additional regions that help increase or enhance transcription. These regions, called\nenhancers, are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance. They can be located upstream of a gene, within the coding region\nof the gene, downstream of a gene, or may be thousands of nucleotides away.\nEnhancer regions are binding sequences, or sites, for specific transcription factors. When a protein transcription factor binds to\n404\nChapter 16 \u2022 Gene Expression\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nits enhancer sequence, the shape of the protein changes, allowing it to interact with proteins at the promoter site. However,\nsince the enhancer region may be distant from the promoter, the DNA must bend to allow the proteins at the two sites to come\ninto contact. DNA bending proteins help to bend the DNA and bring the enhancer and promoter regions together (Figure 16.9).\nThis shape change allows for the interaction of the specific activator proteins bound to the enhancers with the general\ntranscription factors bound to the promoter region and the RNA polymerase.\nFigure 16.9 Interaction between proteins at the promoter and enhancer sites. An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription.\nEach enhancer is made up of short DNA sequences called distal control elements. Activators bound to the distal control elements interact\nwith mediator proteins and transcription factors. Two different genes may have the same promoter but different distal control elements,\nenabling differential gene expression.\nTurning Genes Off: Transcriptional Repressors\nLike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent transcription. Transcriptional repressors can bind to\npromoter or enhancer regions and block transcription. Like the transcriptional activators, repressors respond to external\nstimuli to prevent the binding of activating transcription factors.\n16.5 Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nUnderstand RNA splicing and explain its role in regulating gene expression\n\u2022\nDescribe the importance of RNA stability in gene regulation\nRNA is transcribed, but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin. This processing that takes place\nafter an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-transcriptional\nmodification. As with the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be\nregulated to control gene expression in the cell. If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be\nsynthesized.\nRNA Splicing, the First Stage of Post-transcriptional Control\nIn eukaryotic cells, the RNA transcript often contains regions, called introns, that are removed prior to translation. The regions\nof RNA that code for protein are called exons. (Figure 16.10). After an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but prior to its\ndeparture from the nucleus to be translated, the RNA is processed and the introns are removed by splicing. Splicing is done by\n16.5 \u2022 Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation\n405\nspliceosomes, ribonucleoprotein complexes that can recognize the two ends of the intron, cut the transcript at those two points,\nand bring the exons together for ligation.\nFigure 16.10 Pre-mRNA can be alternatively spliced to create different proteins.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nAlternative RNA Splicing\nIn the 1970s, genes were first observed that exhibited alternative RNA splicing. Alternative RNA splicing is a mechanism that\nallows different protein products to be produced from one gene when different combinations of exons are combined to form the\nmRNA (Figure 16.11). This alternative splicing can be haphazard, but more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene\nregulation, with the frequency of different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of\ndifferent protein products in different cells or at different stages of development. Alternative splicing is now understood to be a\ncommon mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70 percent of genes in humans are expressed\nas multiple proteins through alternative splicing. Although there are multiple ways to alternatively splice RNA transcripts, the\noriginal 5'-3' order of the exons is always conserved. That is, a transcript with exons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 might be spliced 1 2 4 5 6 7 or 1 2 3\n6 7, but never 1 2 5 4 3 6 7.\nFigure 16.11 There are five basic modes of alternative splicing.\nHow could alternative splicing evolve? Introns have a beginning- and ending-recognition sequence; it is easy to imagine the\nfailure of the splicing mechanism to identify the end of an intron and instead find the end of the next intron, thus removing two\nintrons and the intervening exon. In fact, there are mechanisms in place to prevent such intron skipping, but mutations are\nlikely to lead to their failure. Such \u201cmistakes\u201d would more than likely produce a nonfunctional protein. Indeed, the cause of\n406\nChapter 16 \u2022 Gene Expression\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nmany genetic diseases is abnormal splicing rather than mutations in a coding sequence. However, alternative splicing could\npossibly create a protein variant without the loss of the original protein, opening up possibilities for adaptation of the new\nvariant to new functions. Gene duplication has played an important role in the evolution of new functions in a similar way by\nproviding genes that may evolve without eliminating the original, functional protein.\nQuestion: In the corn snake Pantherophis guttatus, there are several different color variants, including amelanistic snakes\nwhose skin patterns display only red and yellow pigments. The cause of amelanism in these snakes was recently identified as the\ninsertion of a transposable element into an intron in the OCA2 (oculocutaneous albinism) gene. How might the insertion of\nextra genetic material into an intron lead to a nonfunctional protein?\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisualize how mRNA splicing happens by watching the process in action in this video.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/mRNA_splicing)\nControl of RNA Stability\nBefore the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is given two protective \"caps\" that prevent the ends of the strand from degrading during\nits journey. 5' and 3' exonucleases can degrade unprotected RNAs. The 5' cap, which is placed on the 5' end of the mRNA, is\nusually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule (GTP). The GTP is placed \"backward\" on the 5' end of the\nmRNA, so that the 5' carbons of the GTP and the terminal nucleotide are linked through three phosphates. The poly-A tail, which\nis attached to the 3' end, is usually composed of a long chain of adenine nucleotides. These changes protect the two ends of the\nRNA from exonuclease attack.\nOnce the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled. Each RNA\nmolecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. This rate of decay can influence how much protein is in the cell. If\nthe decay rate is increased, the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time available for translation of the\nmRNA to occur. Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the mRNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more\nprotein can be translated. This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability. If the RNA is stable, it will be detected for longer\nperiods of time in the cytoplasm.\nBinding of proteins to the RNA can also influence its stability. Proteins called RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, can bind to the\nregions of the mRNA just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. These regions in the RNA that are not\ntranslated into protein are called the untranslated regions, or UTRs. They are not introns (those have been removed in the\nnucleus). Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation. The region just before the\nprotein-coding region is called the 5' UTR, whereas the region after the coding region is called the 3' UTR (Figure 16.12). The\nbinding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the specific RBP that\nbinds.\nFigure 16.12 RNA-binding proteins. The protein-coding region of this processed mRNA is flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs).\nThe presence of RNA-binding proteins at the 5' or 3' UTR influences the stability of the RNA molecule.\nRNA Stability and microRNAs\nIn addition to RBPs that bind to and control (increase or decrease) RNA stability, other elements called microRNAs can bind to\nthe RNA molecule. These microRNAs, or miRNAs, are short RNA molecules that are only 21 to 24 nucleotides in length. The\nmiRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre-miRNAs. These pre-miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein\ncalled Dicer. Like transcription factors and RBPs, mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA; however,\nmiRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RNA\ncomponent of the RISC base-pairs with complementary sequences on an mRNA and either impede translation of the message\n16.5 \u2022 Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation\n407\nor lead to the degradation of the mRNA.\n16.6 Eukaryotic Translational and Post-translational Gene\nRegulation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nUnderstand the process of translation and discuss its key factors\n\u2022\nDescribe how the initiation complex controls translation\n\u2022\nExplain the different ways in which the post-translational control of gene expression takes place\nAfter RNA has been transported to the cytoplasm, it is translated into protein. Control of this process is largely dependent on\nthe RNA molecule. As previously discussed, the stability of the RNA will have a large impact on its translation into a protein. As\nthe stability changes, the amount of time that it is available for translation also changes.\nThe Initiation Complex and Translation Rate\nLike transcription, translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process. In translation, the complex that\nassembles to start the process is referred to as the translation initiation complex. In eukaryotes, translation is initiated by\nbinding the initiating met-tRNAi to the 40S ribosome. This tRNA is brought to the 40S ribosome by a protein initiation factor,\neukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). The eIF-2 protein binds to the high-energy molecule guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The\ntRNA-eIF2-GTP complex then binds to the 40S ribosome. A second complex forms on the mRNA. Several different initiation\nfactors recognize the 5' cap of the mRNA and proteins bound to the poly-A tail of the same mRNA, forming the mRNA into a\nloop. The cap-binding protein eIF4F brings the mRNA complex together with the 40S ribosome complex. The ribosome then\nscans along the mRNA until it finds a start codon AUG. When the anticodon of the initiator tRNA and the start codon are\naligned, the GTP is hydrolyzed, the initiation factors are released, and the large 60S ribosomal subunit binds to form the\ntranslation complex. The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation. If eIF-2 is phosphorylated, it undergoes a\nconformational change and cannot bind to GTP. Therefore, the initiation complex cannot form properly and translation is\nimpeded (Figure 16.13). When eIF-2 remains unphosphorylated, the initiation complex can form normally and translation can\nproceed.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 16.13 Gene expression can be controlled by factors that bind the translation initiation complex.\nAn increase in phosphorylation levels of eIF-2 has been observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as\nAlzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s. What impact do you think this might have on protein synthesis?\nChemical Modifications, Protein Activity, and Longevity\nProteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including methyl, phosphate, acetyl, and ubiquitin groups. The\naddition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they exist in the cell. Sometimes\nthese modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cell\u2014for example, in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm, or attached\n408\nChapter 16 \u2022 Gene Expression\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nto the plasma membrane.\nChemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress, the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light\nexposure. These changes can alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mRNA stability, or translation\u2014all resulting in\nchanges in expression of various genes. This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins in\nresponse to the environment. Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation, the phosphorylation of a protein\n(depending on the protein that is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation (by altering\ntranscription factor binding or function), can change nuclear shuttling (by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore\ncomplex), can alter RNA stability (by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability), can modify translation (increase\nor decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications).\nThe addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation. Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the\nprotein lifespan is complete. These proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that functions to remove proteins, to be\ndegraded (Figure 16.14). One way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the protein.\nFigure 16.14 Proteins with ubiquitin tags are marked for degradation within the proteasome.\n16.7 Cancer and Gene Regulation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe how changes to gene expression can cause cancer\n\u2022\nExplain how changes to gene expression at different levels can disrupt the cell cycle\n\u2022\nDiscuss how understanding regulation of gene expression can lead to better drug design\nCancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases. In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells\ndon\u2019t stop growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the\ncell cycle. One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin B, a protein that\ncontrols the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.\nFor cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle, the cell must pass through checkpoints. This ensures that the cell has\nproperly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function. Many proteins, including cyclin\nB, control these checkpoints. The phosphorylation of cyclin B, a post-translational event, alters its function. As a result, cells can\nprogress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be terminated. This post-\ntranslational change of cyclin B prevents it from controlling the cell cycle and contributes to the development of cancer.\nCancer: Disease of Altered Gene Expression\nCancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. There are many proteins that are turned on or off (gene\nactivation or gene silencing) that dramatically alter the overall activity of the cell. A gene that is not normally expressed in that\ncell can be switched on and expressed at high levels. This can be the result of gene mutation or changes in gene regulation\n(epigenetic, transcription, post-transcription, translation, or post-translation).\nChanges in epigenetic regulation, transcription, RNA stability, protein translation, and post-translational control can be\ndetected in cancer. While these changes don\u2019t occur simultaneously in one cancer, changes at each of these levels can be detected\nwhen observing cancer at different sites in different individuals. Therefore, changes in histone acetylation (epigenetic\nmodification that leads to gene silencing), activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation, increased RNA stability,\nincreased translational control, and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells. Scientists are\n16.7 \u2022 Cancer and Gene Regulation\n409\nworking to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to\ndestroy a tumor cell.\nTumor Suppressor Genes, Oncogenes, and Cancer\nIn normal cells, some genes function to prevent excess, inappropriate cell growth. These are tumor-suppressor genes, which are\nactive in normal cells to prevent uncontrolled cell growth. There are many tumor-suppressor genes in cells. The most studied\ntumor-suppressor gene is p53, which is mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer types. The p53 protein itself functions as a\ntranscription factor. It can bind to sites in the promoters of genes to initiate transcription. Therefore, the mutation of p53 in\ncancer will dramatically alter the transcriptional activity of its target genes.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this animation (http://openstax.org/l/p53_cancer) to learn more about the use of p53 in fighting cancer.\nProto-oncogenes are positive cell-cycle regulators. When mutated, proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes and cause cancer.\nOverexpression of the oncogene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. This is because oncogenes can alter transcriptional\nactivity, stability, or protein translation of another gene that directly or indirectly controls cell growth. An example of an\noncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc. Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in Burkett\u2019s\nLymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system. Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to\ngrow uncontrollably. High B-cell numbers can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily function. Patients with\nBurkett\u2019s lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth that interfere with the ability to eat.\nCancer and Epigenetic Alterations\nSilencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in cancer cells. There are characteristic modifications to\nhistone proteins and DNA that are associated with silenced genes. In cancer cells, the DNA in the promoter region of silenced\ngenes is methylated on cytosine DNA residues in CpG islands. Histone proteins that surround that region lack the acetylation\nmodification that is present when the genes are expressed in normal cells. This combination of DNA methylation and histone\ndeacetylation (epigenetic modifications that lead to gene silencing) is commonly found in cancer. When these modifications\noccur, the gene present in that chromosomal region is silenced. Increasingly, scientists understand how epigenetic changes are\naltered in cancer. Because these changes are temporary and can be reversed\u2014for example, by preventing the action of the\nhistone deacetylase protein that removes acetyl groups, or by DNA methyl transferase enzymes that add methyl groups to\ncytosines in DNA\u2014it is possible to design new drugs and new therapies to take advantage of the reversible nature of these\nprocesses. Indeed, many researchers are testing how a silenced gene can be switched back on in a cancer cell to help re-establish\nnormal growth patterns.\nGenes involved in the development of many other illnesses, ranging from allergies to inflammation to autism, are thought to be\nregulated by epigenetic mechanisms. As our knowledge of how genes are controlled deepens, new ways to treat diseases like\ncancer will emerge.\nCancer and Transcriptional Control\nAlterations in cells that give rise to cancer can affect the transcriptional control of gene expression. Mutations that activate\ntranscription factors, such as increased phosphorylation, can increase the binding of a transcription factor to its binding site in\na promoter. This could lead to increased transcriptional activation of that gene that results in modified cell growth.\nAlternatively, a mutation in the DNA of a promoter or enhancer region can increase the binding ability of a transcription factor.\nThis could also lead to the increased transcription and aberrant gene expression that is seen in cancer cells.\nResearchers have been investigating how to control the transcriptional activation of gene expression in cancer. Identifying how a\ntranscription factor binds, or a pathway that activates where a gene can be turned off, has led to new drugs and new ways to\ntreat cancer. In breast cancer, for example, many proteins are overexpressed. This can lead to increased phosphorylation of key\ntranscription factors that increase transcription. One such example is the overexpression of the epidermal growth-factor\nreceptor (EGFR) in a subset of breast cancers. The EGFR pathway activates many protein kinases that, in turn, activate many\ntranscription factors which control genes involved in cell growth. New drugs that prevent the activation of EGFR have been\ndeveloped and are used to treat these cancers.\n410\nChapter 16 \u2022 Gene Expression\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nCancer and Post-transcriptional Control\nChanges in the post-transcriptional control of a gene can also result in cancer. Recently, several groups of researchers have\nshown that specific cancers have altered expression of miRNAs. Because miRNAs bind to the 3' UTR of RNA molecules to\ndegrade them, overexpression of these miRNAs could be detrimental to normal cellular activity. Too many miRNAs could\ndramatically decrease the RNA population, leading to a decrease in protein expression. Several studies have demonstrated a\nchange in the miRNA population in specific cancer types. It appears that the subset of miRNAs expressed in breast cancer cells is\nquite different from the subset expressed in lung cancer cells or even from normal breast cells. This suggests that alterations in\nmiRNA activity can contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells. These types of studies also suggest that if some miRNAs are\nspecifically expressed only in cancer cells, they could be potential drug targets. It would, therefore, be conceivable that new\ndrugs that turn off miRNA expression in cancer could be an effective method to treat cancer.\nCancer and Translational/Post-translational Control\nThere are many examples of how translational or post-translational modifications of proteins arise in cancer. Modifications are\nfound in cancer cells from the increased translation of a protein to changes in protein phosphorylation to alternative splice\nvariants of a protein. An example of how the expression of an alternative form of a protein can have dramatically different\noutcomes is seen in colon cancer cells. The c-Flip protein, a protein involved in mediating the cell-death pathway, comes in two\nforms: long (c-FLIPL) and short (c-FLIPS). Both forms appear to be involved in initiating controlled cell-death mechanisms in\nnormal cells. However, in colon cancer cells, expression of the long form results in increased cell growth instead of cell death.\nClearly, the expression of the wrong protein dramatically alters cell function and contributes to the development of cancer.\nNew Drugs to Combat Cancer: Targeted Therapies\nScientists are using what is known about the regulation of gene expression in disease states, including cancer, to develop new\nways to treat and prevent disease development. Many scientists are designing drugs on the basis of the gene expression patterns\nwithin individual tumors. This idea, that therapy and medicines can be tailored to an individual, has given rise to the field of\npersonalized medicine. With an increased understanding of gene regulation and gene function, medicines can be designed to\nspecifically target diseased cells without harming healthy cells. Some new medicines, called targeted therapies, have exploited\nthe overexpression of a specific protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat disease. One such\nexample is the use of anti-EGF receptor medications to treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have very high levels of the\nEGF protein. Undoubtedly, more targeted therapies will be developed as scientists learn more about how gene expression\nchanges can cause cancer.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nClinical Trial Coordinator\nA clinical trial coordinator is the person managing the proceedings of the clinical trial. This job includes coordinating patient\nschedules and appointments, maintaining detailed notes, building the database to track patients (especially for long-term\nfollow-up studies), ensuring proper documentation has been acquired and accepted, and working with the nurses and doctors\nto facilitate the trial and publication of the results.

Prokaryotic organisms express most of their genes\nmost of the time. However, some genes are expressed only\nwhen they are needed. Eukaryotic organisms, on the other\nhand, express only a subset of their genes in any given cell.\nTo express a protein, the DNA is first transcribed into RNA,\nwhich is then translated into proteins, which are then\ntargeted to specific cellular locations. In prokaryotic cells,\ntranscription and translation occur almost simultaneously.\nIn eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus and is\nseparate from the translation that occurs in the cytoplasm.\nGene expression in prokaryotes is mostly regulated at the\ntranscriptional level (some epigenetic and post-translational\nregulation is also present), whereas in eukaryotic cells, gene\nexpression is regulated at the epigenetic, transcriptional,\npost-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational\nlevels.\n16.2 Prokaryotic Gene Regulation\nThe regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs\nat the transcriptional level. There are two majors kinds of\nproteins that control prokaryotic transcription: repressors\nand activators. Repressors bind to an operator region to\nblock the action of RNA polymerase. Activators bind to the\npromoter to enhance the binding of RNA polymerase.\nInducer molecules can increase transcription either by\ninactivating repressors or by activating activator proteins. In\nthe trp operon, the trp repressor is itself activated by binding\nto tryptophan. Therefore, if tryptophan is not needed, the\nrepressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains\noff. The lac operon is activated by the CAP (catabolite\nactivator protein), which binds to the promoter to stabilize\nRNA polymerase binding. CAP is itself activated by cAMP,\nwhose concentration rises as the concentration of glucose\nfalls. However, the lac operon also requires the presence of\nlactose for transcription to occur. Lactose inactivates the lac\nrepressor, and prevents the repressor protein from binding\nto the lac operator. With the repressor inactivated,\ntranscription may proceed. Therefore glucose must be absent\nand lactose must be present for effective transcription of the\nlac operon.\n16.3 Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene\nRegulation\nIn eukaryotic cells, the first stage of gene-expression control\noccurs at the epigenetic level. Epigenetic mechanisms\ncontrol access to the chromosomal region to allow genes to\nbe turned on or off. Chromatin remodeling controls how\nDNA is packed into the nucleus by regulating how tightly the\nDNA is wound around histone proteins. The DNA itself may\nbe methylated to selectively silence genes. The addition or\nremoval of chemical modifications (or flags) to histone\nproteins or DNA signals the cell to open or close a\nchromosomal region. Therefore, eukaryotic cells can control\nwhether a gene is expressed by controlling accessibility to the\nbinding of RNA polymerase and its transcription factors.\n16.4 Eukaryotic Transcription Gene\nRegulation\nTo start transcription, general transcription factors, such as\nTFIID, TFIIB, and others, must first bind to the TATA box\nand recruit RNA polymerase to that location. Additional\ntranscription factors may also bind to other regulatory\nelements at the promoter to increase or prevent\ntranscription. In addition to promoter sequences, enhancer\nregions help augment transcription. Enhancers can be\nupstream, downstream, within a gene itself, or on other\nchromosomes. Specific transcription factors bound to\nenhancer regions may either increase or prevent\ntranscription.\n16.5 Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional\nGene Regulation\nPost-transcriptional control can occur at any stage after\ntranscription, including RNA splicing and RNA stability.\nOnce RNA is transcribed, it must be processed to create a\nmature RNA that is ready to be translated. This involves the\nremoval of introns that do not code for protein.\nSpliceosomes bind to the signals that mark the exon/intron\nborder to remove the introns and ligate the exons together.\nOnce this occurs, the RNA is mature and can be translated.\nAlternative splicing can produce more than one mRNA from\na given transcript. Different splicing variants may be\nproduced under different conditions.\nRNA is created and spliced in the nucleus, but needs to be\ntransported to the cytoplasm to be translated. RNA is\ntransported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore\ncomplex. Once the RNA is in the cytoplasm, the length of\ntime it resides there before being degraded, called RNA\nstability, can also be altered to control the overall amount of\nprotein that is synthesized. The RNA stability can be\nincreased, leading to longer residency time in the cytoplasm,\nor decreased, leading to shortened time and less protein\nsynthesis. RNA stability is controlled by RNA-binding\nproteins (RPBs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). These RPBs and\nmiRNAs bind to the 5' UTR or the 3' UTR of the RNA to\nincrease or decrease RNA stability. MicroRNAs associated\nwith RISC complexes may repress translation or lead to\nmRNA breakdown.\nChapter 16 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n413\n16.6 Eukaryotic Translational and\nPost-translational Gene Regulation\nChanging the status of the RNA or the protein itself can\naffect the amount of protein, the function of the protein, or\nhow long it is found in the cell. To translate the protein, a\nprotein initiator complex must assemble on the RNA.\nModifications (such as phosphorylation) of proteins in this\ncomplex can prevent proper translation from occurring.\nOnce a protein has been synthesized, it can be modified\n(phosphorylated, acetylated, methylated, or ubiquitinated).\nThese post-translational modifications can greatly impact\nthe stability, degradation, or function of the protein.\n16.7 Cancer and Gene Regulation\nCancer can be described as a disease of altered gene\nexpression. Changes at every level of eukaryotic gene\nexpression can be detected in some form of cancer at some\npoint in time. In order to understand how changes to gene\nexpression can cause cancer, it is critical to understand how\neach stage of gene regulation works in normal cells. By\nunderstanding the mechanisms of control in normal, non-\ndiseased cells, it will be easier for scientists to understand\nwhat goes wrong in disease states including complex ones\nlike cancer.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

Genomics is the study of\nentire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and\ntheir interactions within a species and with other species. DNA sequencing technology has contributed\nto advances in genomics. Just as information technology has led to Google maps that enable people to\nobtain detailed information about locations around the globe, researchers use genomic information to\ncreate similar DNA maps of different organisms. These findings have helped anthropologists to better\nunderstand human migration and have aided the medical field through mapping human genetic\ndiseases. Genomic information can contribute to scientific understanding in various ways and\nknowledge in the field is quickly growing.\nChapter Outline\n17.1 Biotechnology\n17.2 Mapping Genomes\n17.3 Whole-Genome\nSequencing\n17.4 Applying Genomics\n17.5 Genomics and\nProteomics\nbreeding livestock and crops long before people understood the scientific basis of these techniques. Since\nthe discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, the biotechnology field has grown rapidly through both\nacademic research and private companies. The primary applications of this technology are in medicine\n(vaccine and antibiotic production) and agriculture (crop genetic modification in order to increase yields).\nBiotechnology also has many industrial applications, such as fermentation, treating oil spills, and producing\nbiofuels (Figure 17.2).\nFigure 17.2 Fungi, bacteria, and other organisms that have antimicrobial properties produce antibiotics. The first\nantibiotic discovered was penicillin. Pharmaceutical companies now commercially produce and test antibiotics for\ntheir potential to inhibit bacterial growth. (credit \"advertisement\": modification of work by NIH; credit \"test plate\":\nmodification of work by Don Stalons/CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nBasic Techniques to Manipulate Genetic Material (DNA and RNA)\nTo understand the basic techniques used to work with nucleic acids, remember that nucleic acids are\nmacromolecules made of nucleotides (a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base) linked by\nphosphodiester bonds. The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge. An entire\nset of DNA molecules in the nucleus is called the genome. DNA has two complementary strands linked by\nhydrogen bonds between the paired bases. Exposure to high temperatures (DNA denaturation) can separate\nthe two strands and cooling can reanneal them. The DNA polymerase enzyme can replicate the DNA. Unlike\nDNA, which is located in the eukaryotic cells' nucleus, RNA molecules leave the nucleus. The most common\ntype of RNA that researchers analyze is the messenger RNA (mRNA) because it represents the protein-\ncoding genes that are actively expressed. However, RNA molecules present some other challenges to\nanalysis, as they are often less stable than DNA.\nDNA and RNA Extraction\nTo study or manipulate nucleic acids, one must first isolate or extract the DNA or RNA from the cells.\nResearchers use various techniques to extract different types of DNA (Figure 17.3). Most nucleic acid\nextraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all\nmacromolecules that are not desired (such as unwanted molecule degradation and separation from the DNA\nsample). A lysis buffer (a solution which is mostly a detergent) breaks cells. Note that lysis means \"to split\".\nThese enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes. Enzymes such as\nproteases that break down proteins inactivate macromolecules, and ribonucleases (RNAses) that break\ndown RNA. Using alcohol precipitates the DNA. Human genomic DNA is usually visible as a gelatinous,\nwhite mass. One can store the DNA samples frozen at \u201380\u00b0C for several years.\n418\nChapter 17 \u2022 Biotechnology and Genomics\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 17.3 This diagram shows the basic method of DNA extraction.\nScientists perform RNA analysis to study gene expression patterns in cells. RNA is naturally very unstable because RNAses are\ncommonly present in nature and very difficult to inactivate. Similar to DNA, RNA extraction involves using various buffers and\nenzymes to inactivate macromolecules and preserve the RNA.\nGel Electrophoresis\nBecause nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment, an electric field can\nmobilize them. Gel electrophoresis is a technique that scientists use to separate molecules on the basis of size, using this\ncharge. One can separate the nucleic acids as whole chromosomes or fragments. The nucleic acids load into a slot near the\nsemisolid, porous gel matrix's negative electrode, and pulled toward the positive electrode at the gel's opposite end. Smaller\nmolecules move through the gel's pores faster than larger molecules. This difference in the migration rate separates the\nfragments on the basis of size. There are molecular weight standard samples that researchers can run alongside the molecules to\nprovide a size comparison. We can observe nucleic acids in a gel matrix using various fluorescent or colored dyes. Distinct\nnucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the gel's top (the negative electrode end) on the basis of their\nsize (Figure 17.4). A mixture of genomic DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear; whereas, uncut genomic DNA\nis usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the gel's top.\n17.1 \u2022 Biotechnology\n419\nFigure 17.4 a) Shown are DNA fragments from seven samples run on a gel, stained with a fluorescent dye, and viewed under UV light; and\nb) a researcher from International Rice Research Institute, reviewing DNA profiles using UV light. (credit: a: James Jacob, Tompkins\nCortland Community College b: International Rice Research Institute)\nNucleic Acid Fragment Amplification by Polymerase Chain Reaction\nAlthough genomic DNA is visible to the naked eye when it is extracted in bulk, DNA analysis often requires focusing on one or\nmore specific genome regions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique that scientists use to amplify specific DNA\nregions for further analysis (Figure 17.5). Researchers use PCR for many purposes in laboratories, such as cloning gene\nfragments to analyze genetic diseases, identifying contaminant foreign DNA in a sample, and amplifying DNA for sequencing.\nMore practical applications include determining paternity and detecting genetic diseases.\n420\nChapter 17 \u2022 Biotechnology and Genomics\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 17.5 Scientists use polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to amplify a specific DNA sequence. Primers\u2014short pieces of DNA\ncomplementary to each end of the target sequence combine with genomic DNA, Taq polymerase, and deoxynucleotides. Taq polymerase is\na DNA polymerase isolated from the thermostable bacterium Thermus aquaticus that is able to withstand the high temperatures that\nscientists use in PCR. Thermus aquaticus grows in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-\nPCR) is similar to PCR, but cDNA is made from an RNA template before PCR begins.\nDNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The first\nstep is to recreate the original DNA template strand (called cDNA) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA. This process is\ncalled reverse transcription. This requires the presence of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. After the cDNA is made,\nregular PCR can be used to amplify it.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDeepen your understanding of the polymerase chain reaction by watching this video (http://openstax.org/l/PCR) .\nHybridization, Southern Blotting, and Northern Blotting\nScientists can probe nucleic acid samples, such as fragmented genomic DNA and RNA extracts, for the presence of certain\nsequences. Scientists design and label short DNA fragments, or probes with radioactive or fluorescent dyes to aid detection. Gel\nelectrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size. Scientists then transfer the fragments in the gel\nonto a nylon membrane in a procedure we call blotting (Figure 17.6). Scientists can then probe the nucleic acid fragments that\nare bound to the membrane's surface with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences. When scientists\ntransfer DNA to a nylon membrane, they refer to the technique as Southern blotting. When they transfer the RNA to a nylon\nmembrane, they call it Northern blotting. Scientists use Southern blots to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a\ngiven genome, and Northern blots to detect gene expression.\n17.1 \u2022 Biotechnology\n421\nFigure 17.6 Scientists use Southern blotting to find a particular sequence in a DNA sample. Scientists separate DNA fragments on a gel,\ntransfer them to a nylon membrane, and incubate them with a DNA probe complementary to the sequence of interest. Northern blotting is\nsimilar to Southern blotting, but scientists run RNA on the gel instead of DNA. In Western blotting, scientists run proteins on a gel and\ndetect them using antibodies.\nMolecular Cloning\nIn general, the word \u201ccloning\u201d means the creation of a perfect replica; however, in biology, the re-creation of a whole organism is\nreferred to as \u201creproductive cloning.\u201d Long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers learned how to\nreproduce desired regions or fragments of the genome, a process that is referred to as molecular cloning.\nCloning small genome fragments allows researchers to manipulate and study specific genes (and their protein products), or\nnoncoding regions in isolation. A plasmid, or vector, is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates independently of the\nchromosomal DNA. In cloning, scientists can use the plasmid molecules to provide a \"folder\" in which to insert a desired DNA\nfragment. Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation. In the bacterial context, scientists call the DNA\nfragment from the human genome (or the genome of another studied organism) foreign DNA, or a transgene, to differentiate it\nfrom the bacterium's DNA, or the host DNA.\nPlasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as Escherichia coli) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to\nthe organism, such as antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Scientists have repurposed and\nengineered plasmids as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such as insulin and\nhuman growth hormone. An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which scientists can introduce a foreign DNA\nfragment via the multiple cloning site (MCS). The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that different\ncommonly available restriction endonucleases can cut. Restriction endonucleases recognize specific DNA sequences and cut\nthem in a predictable manner. They are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA. Many\nrestriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two DNA strands, such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single-\nstranded overhang. Because these overhangs are capable of annealing with complementary overhangs, we call them \u201csticky\nends.\u201d Adding the enzyme DNA ligase permanently joins the DNA fragments via phosphodiester bonds. In this way, scientists\ncan splice any DNA fragment generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage between the plasmid DNA's two ends that has been\ncut with the same restriction endonuclease (Figure 17.7).\nRecombinant DNA Molecules\nPlasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they are created artificially and\ndo not occur in nature. They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different molecule parts of the molecules\ncan be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis. We call proteins that are expressed\nfrom recombinant DNA molecules recombinant proteins. Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes. The\nrecombinant DNA may need to move into a different vector (or host) that is better designed for gene expression. Scientists may\nalso engineer plasmids to express proteins only when certain environmental factors stimulate them, so they can control the\n422\nChapter 17 \u2022 Biotechnology and Genomics\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nrecombinant proteins' expression.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 17.7 This diagram shows the steps involved in molecular cloning.\nYou are working in a molecular biology lab and, unbeknownst to you, your lab partner left the foreign genomic DNA that you are\nplanning to clone on the lab bench overnight instead of storing it in the freezer. As a result, it was degraded by nucleases, but\nstill used in the experiment. The plasmid, on the other hand, is fine. What results would you expect from your molecular cloning\nexperiment?\na.\nThere will be no colonies on the bacterial plate.\nb.\nThere will be blue colonies only.\nc.\nThere will be blue and white colonies.\nd.\nThe will be white colonies only.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView an animation of recombination in cloning (http://openstax.org/l/recombination) from the DNA Learning Center.\nCellular Cloning\nUnicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by\n17.1 \u2022 Biotechnology\n423\nbinary fission; this is known as cellular cloning. The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis, which creates an exact\nreplica of the genetic material.\nReproductive Cloning\nReproductive cloning is a method scientists use to clone or identically copy an entire multicellular organism. Most multicellular\norganisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals (parents), making it\nimpossible to generate an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to\nartificially induce mammal asexual reproduction in the laboratory.\nParthenogenesis, or \u201cvirgin birth,\u201d occurs when an embryo grows and develops without egg fertilization. This is a form of\nasexual reproduction. An example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is\nfertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female. If the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and\ndevelops into a male. The unfertilized egg is a parthenogenic, or virgin egg. Some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs\nthat can develop into adults.\nSexual reproduction requires two cells. When the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. The zygote nucleus\ncontains the genetic information to produce a new individual. However, early embryonic development requires the cytoplasmic\nmaterial contained in the egg cell. This idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. Therefore, if we replace the egg cell's\nhaploid nucleus with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species (a donor), it will become a zygote that\nis genetically identical to the donor. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an\nenucleated egg. Scientists can use it for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning.\nThe first cloned animal was Dolly, a sheep born in 1996. The reproductive cloning success rate at the time was very low. Dolly\nlived for seven years and died of respiratory complications (Figure 17.8). There is speculation that because the cell DNA belongs\nto an older individual, DNA's age may affect a cloned individual's life expectancy. Since Dolly, scientists have cloned successfully\nseveral animals such as horses, bulls, and goats, although these animals often exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities.\nThere have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells for therapeutic purposes.\nTherapeutic cloning produces stem cells in the attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects (unlike reproductive cloning,\nwhich aims to reproduce an organism). Still, some have met therapeutic cloning efforts with resistance because of bioethical\nconsiderations.\n424\nChapter 17 \u2022 Biotechnology and Genomics\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 17.8 Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be cloned. To create Dolly, they removed the nucleus from a donor egg cell. They then\nintroduced the nucleus from a second sheep into the cell, which divided to the blastocyst stage before they implanted it in a surrogate\nmother. (credit: modification of work by \"Squidonius\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nDo you think Dolly was a Finn-Dorset or a Scottish Blackface sheep?\nGenetic Engineering\nGenetic engineering is the alteration of an organism\u2019s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism\u2019s\nDNA to achieve desirable traits. The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular\ncloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is a genetically\nmodified organism (GMO). If the foreign DNA comes from a different species, the host organism is transgenic. Scientists have\ngenetically modified bacteria, plants, and animals since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial\npurposes. In the US, GMOs such as Roundup-ready soybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed\nfoods.\nGene Targeting\nAlthough classical methods of studying gene function began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that\nphenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: \"What does this gene or DNA\nelement do?\" This technique, reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic methodology. This method would be\nsimilar to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the wing's\nfunction is flight. The classical genetic method would compare insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that\nthe non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene\nfunction. We collectively call the methods they use to disable gene function gene targeting. Gene targeting is the use of\nrecombinant DNA vectors to alter a particular gene's expression, either by introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating a\ncertain gene's expression by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the organism's genome.\nBiotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture\nIt is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes. Knowledge of the genetic makeup of our species, the\n17.1 \u2022 Biotechnology\n425\ngenetic basis of heritable diseases, and the invention of technology to manipulate and fix mutant genes provides methods to\ntreat the disease. Biotechnology in agriculture can enhance resistance to disease, pest, and environmental stress, and improve\nboth crop yield and quality.\nGenetic Diagnosis and Gene Therapy\nScientists call the process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment genetic diagnosis by genetic\ntesting. Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease-causing gene, family members are advised to undergo genetic\ntesting. For example, doctors usually advise women diagnosed with breast cancer to have a biopsy so that the medical team can\ndetermine the genetic basis of cancer development. Doctors base treatment plans on genetic test findings that determine the\ntype of cancer. If inherited gene mutations cause the cancer, doctors also advise other female relatives to undergo genetic\ntesting and periodic screening for breast cancer. Doctors also offer genetic testing for fetuses (or embryos with in vitro\nfertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases.\nGene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease. In its simplest form, it involves the introduction of a good\ngene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene. The good gene is usually\nintroduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus that can infect the host cell and deliver the foreign DNA\n(Figure 17.9). More advanced forms of gene therapy try to correct the mutation at the original site in the genome, such as is the\ncase with treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).\nFigure 17.9 Gene therapy using an adenovirus vector can be used to cure certain genetic diseases in which a person has a defective gene.\n(credit: NIH)\nProduction of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones\nTraditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms to mount the initial immune response.\nModern techniques use the genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors to mass produce the desired antigen. Doctors then\nintroduce the antigen into the body to stimulate the primary immune response and trigger immune memory. The medical field\nhas used genes cloned from the influenza virus to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus.\nAntibiotics are a biotechnological product. Microorganisms, such as fungi, naturally produce them to attain an advantage over\nbacterial populations. Cultivating and manipulating fungal cells produces antibodies.\nScientists used recombinant DNA technology to produce large-scale quantities of human insulin in E. coli as early as 1978.\nPreviously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in humans because of\n426\nChapter 17 \u2022 Biotechnology and Genomics\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ndifferences in the gene product. In addition, doctors use human growth hormone (HGH) to treat growth disorders in children.\nResearchers cloned the HGH gene from a cDNA library and inserted it into E. coli cells by cloning it into a bacterial vector.\nTransgenic Animals\nAlthough several recombinant proteins in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins require a eukaryotic\nanimal host for proper processing. For this reason, the desired genes are cloned and expressed in animals, such as sheep, goats,\nchickens, and mice. We call animals that have been modified to express recombinant DNA transgenic animals. Several human\nproteins are expressed in transgenic sheep and goat milk, and some are expressed in chicken eggs. Scientists have used mice\nextensively for expressing and studying recombinant gene and mutation effects.\nTransgenic Plants\nManipulating the DNA of plants (i.e., creating GMOs) has helped to create desirable traits, such as disease resistance, herbicide\nand pesticide resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life (Figure 17.10). Plants are the most important source of\nfood for the human population. Farmers developed ways to select for plant varieties with desirable traits long before modern-\nday biotechnology practices were established.\nFigure 17.10 Corn, a major agricultural crop used to create products for a variety of industries, is often modified through plant\nbiotechnology. (credit: Keith Weller, USDA)\nWe call plants that have received recombinant DNA from other species transgenic plants. Because they are not natural,\ngovernment agencies closely monitor transgenic plants and other GMOs to ensure that they are fit for human consumption and\ndo not endanger other plant and animal life. Because foreign genes can spread to other species in the environment, extensive\ntesting is required to ensure ecological stability. Staples like corn, potatoes, and tomatoes were the first crop plants that\nscientists genetically engineered.\nTransformation of Plants Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens\nGene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations. Many viruses that cause human diseases, such as\ncancer, act by incorporating their DNA into the human genome. In plants, tumors caused by the bacterium Agrobacterium\ntumefaciens occur by DNA transfer from the bacterium to the plant. Although the tumors do not kill the plants, they stunt the\nplants and they become more susceptible to harsh environmental conditions. A. tumefaciens affects many plants such as\nwalnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets. Artificially introducing DNA into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells\nbecause of the thick plant cell wall.\n17.1 \u2022 Biotechnology\n427\nResearchers used the natural transfer of DNA from Agrobacterium to a plant host to introduce DNA fragments of their choice\ninto plant hosts. In nature, the disease-causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids, Ti plasmids (tumor-inducing plasmids),\nthat contain genes to produce tumors in plants. DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell\u2019s genome.\nResearchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the desired DNA fragment for transfer\ninto the plant genome. The Ti plasmids carry antibiotic resistance genes to aid selection and researchers can propagate them in\nE. coli cells as well.\nThe Organic Insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis\nBacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacterium that produces protein crystals during sporulation that are toxic to many insect species\nthat affect plants. Insects need to ingest Bt toxin in order to activate the toxin. Insects that have eaten Bt toxin stop feeding on\nthe plants within a few hours. After the toxin activates in the insects' intestines, they die within a couple of days. Modern\nbiotechnology has allowed plants to encode their own crystal Bt toxin that acts against insects. Scientists have cloned the crystal\ntoxin genes from Bt and introduced them into plants. Bt toxin is safe for the environment, nontoxic to humans and other\nmammals, and organic farmers have approved it as a natural insecticide.\nFlavr Savr Tomato\nThe first GM crop on the market was the Flavr Savr Tomato in 1994. Scientists used antisense RNA technology to slow the\nsoftening and rotting process caused by fungal infections, which led to increased shelf life of the GM tomatoes. Additional\ngenetic modification improved the tomato's flavor. The Flavr Savr tomato did not successfully stay in the market because of\nproblems maintaining and shipping the crop.\n17.2 Mapping Genomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDefine genomics\n\u2022\nDescribe genetic and physical maps\n\u2022\nDescribe genomic mapping methods\nGenomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and\ntheir interactions within a species and with other species. Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on\neach chromosome. The maps that genome mapping create are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. A genetic\nmap is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to an\ninterstate highway map) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a\nchromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait. Early geneticists called this linkage analysis.\nPhysical maps present the intimate details of smaller chromosome regions (similar to a detailed road map). A physical map is a\nrepresentation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. Both genetic linkage maps and\nphysical maps are required to build a genome\u2019s complete picture. Having a complete genome map of the genome makes it easier\nfor researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-\ncausing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis. We can use genome mapping in a variety of other\napplications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome\nmapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to climate change.\nGenetic Maps\nThe study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis, a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes\nto determine if they are linked or show independent assortment. Scientists used the term linkage before the discovery of DNA.\nEarly geneticists relied on observing phenotypic changes to understand an organism\u2019s genotype. Shortly after Gregor Mendel\n(the father of modern genetics) proposed that traits were determined by what we now call genes, other researchers observed\nthat different traits were often inherited together, and thereby deduced that the genes were physically linked by their location on\nthe same chromosome. Gene mapping relative to each other based on linkage analysis led to developing the first genetic maps.\nObservations that certain traits were always linked and certain others were not linked came from studying the offspring of\ncrosses between parents with different traits. For example, in garden pea experiments, researchers discovered, that the flower\u2019s\ncolor and plant pollen\u2019s shape were linked traits, and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the\nsame chromosome. We call exchanging DNA between homologous chromosome pairs genetic recombination, which occurs by\ncrossing over DNA between homologous DNA strands, such as nonsister chromatids. Linkage analysis involves studying the\nrecombination frequency between any two genes. The greater the distance between two genes, the higher the chance that a\n428\nChapter 17 \u2022 Biotechnology and Genomics\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nrecombination event will occur between them, and the higher the recombination frequency between them. Figure 17.11 shows\ntwo possibilities for recombination between two nonsister chromatids during meiosis. If the recombination frequency between\ntwo genes is less than 50 percent, they are linked.\nFigure 17.11 Crossover may occur at different locations on the chromosome. Recombination between genes A and B is more frequent than\nrecombination between genes B and C because genes A and B are farther apart. Therefore, a crossover is more likely to occur between\nthem.\nThe generation of genetic maps requires markers, just as a road map requires landmarks (such as rivers and mountains).\nScientists based early genetic maps on using known genes as markers. Scientists now use more sophisticated markers,\nincluding those based on non-coding DNA, to compare individuals\u2019 genomes in a population. Although individuals of a given\nspecies are genetically similar, they are not identical. Every individual has a unique set of traits. These minor differences in the\ngenome between individuals in a population are useful for genetic mapping purposes. In general, a good genetic marker is a\nregion on the chromosome that shows variability or polymorphism (multiple forms) in the population.\nSome genetic markers that scientists use in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP),\nvariable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs), microsatellite polymorphisms, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\nWe can detect RFLPs (sometimes pronounced \u201crif-lips\u201d) when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease\nthat recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments, which we can then analyze using gel\nelectrophoresis. Every individual\u2019s DNA will give rise to a unique pattern of bands when cut with a particular set of restriction\nendonucleases. Scientists sometimes refer to this as an individual\u2019s DNA \u201cfingerprint.\u201d Certain chromosome regions that are\nsubject to polymorphism will lead to generating the unique banding pattern. VNTRs are repeated sets of nucleotides present in\nDNA\u2019s non-coding regions. Non-coding, or \u201cjunk,\u201d DNA has no known biological function; however, research shows that much\nof this DNA is actually transcribed. While its function is uncertain, it is certainly active, and it may be involved in regulating\ncoding genes. The number of repeats may vary in a population\u2019s individual organisms. Microsatellite polymorphisms are similar\nto VNTRs, but the repeat unit is very small. SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide.\nBecause genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of recombination, natural increases or decreases in the\nrecombination level given genome area affects mapping. Some parts of the genome are recombination hotspots; whereas,\nothers do not show a propensity for recombination. For this reason, it is important to look at mapping information developed by\nmultiple methods.\nPhysical Maps\nA physical map provides detail of the actual physical distance between genetic markers, as well as the number of nucleotides.\nThere are three methods scientists use to create a physical map: cytogenetic mapping, radiation hybrid mapping, and sequence\nmapping. Cytogenetic mapping uses information from microscopic analysis of stained chromosome sections (Figure 17.12). It is\n17.2 \u2022 Mapping Genomes\n429\npossible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping, but not the exact distance\n(number of base pairs). Radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation, such as x-rays, to break the DNA into fragments. We can\nadjust the radiation amount to create smaller or larger fragments. This technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping,\nand we can adjust the radiation so that increased or decreased recombination frequency does not affect it. Sequence mapping\nresulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for creating detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of\nthe number of base pairs. Creating genomic libraries and complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries (collections of cloned\nsequences or all DNA from a genome) has sped the physical mapping process. A genetic site that scientists use to generate a\nphysical map with sequencing technology (a sequence-tagged site, or STS) is a unique sequence in the genome with a known\nexact chromosomal location. An expressed sequence tag (EST) and a single sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) are common\nSTSs. An EST is a short STS that we can identify with cDNA libraries, while we obtain SSLPs from known genetic markers,\nwhich provide a link between genetic and physical maps.\nFigure 17.12 A cytogenetic map shows the appearance of a chromosome after scientists stain and exam it under a microscope. (credit:\nNational Human Genome Research Institute)\nGenetic and Physical Maps Integration\nGenetic maps provide the outline and physical maps provide the details. It is easy to understand why both genome mapping\ntechnique types are important to show the big picture. Scientists use information from each technique in combination to study\nthe genome. Scientists are using genomic mapping with different model organisms for research. Genome mapping is still an\nongoing process, and as researchers develop more advanced techniques, they expect more breakthroughs. Genome mapping is\nsimilar to completing a complicated puzzle using every piece of available data. Mapping information generated in laboratories\nall over the world goes into central databases, such as GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).\n430\nChapter 17 \u2022 Biotechnology and Genomics\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nResearchers are making efforts for the information to be more easily accessible to other researchers and the general public. Just\nas we use global positioning systems instead of paper maps to navigate through roadways, NCBI has created a genome viewer\ntool to simplify the data-mining process.\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION\nHow to Use a Genome Map Viewer\nProblem statement: Do the human, macaque, and mouse genomes contain common DNA sequences?\nDevelop a hypothesis.\nGo to this website (https://openstax.org/l/GeneINSR) to test the hypothesis.\nThe web page displays the comparison of the gene sequences of many organisms to the Human Insulin Receptor gene.

Focus the attention to the bottom part, the Selected Orthologues. Explore which columns are relevant to the\nneeded information.\nOn the same page, there are other options to explore, not all are necessary for the task, however it might give more insight to the\nvalue of genome/gene comparisons.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nOnline Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) is a searchable online catalog of human genes and genetic disorders. This website\nshows genome mapping information, and also details the history and research of each trait and disorder. Click this link\n(http://openstax.org/l/OMIM) to search for traits (such as handedness) and genetic disorders (such as diabetes).\n17.3 Whole-Genome Sequencing\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe three types of sequencing\n\u2022\nDefine whole-genome sequencing\nAlthough there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years, doctors are still confounded by some\ndiseases, and they are using whole-genome sequencing to discover the root of the problem. Whole-genome sequencing is a\nprocess that determines an entire genome\u2019s DNA sequence. Whole-genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to problem\nsolving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease. Several laboratories now provide services to sequence, analyze, and\ninterpret entire genomes.\nFor example, whole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing. In exome sequencing, the\ndoctor sequences only the DNA\u2019s coding, exon-producing regions. In 2010, doctors used whole-exome sequencing to save a\nyoung boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally,\nthey performed whole-exome sequencing, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell\ndeath). The doctors used a bone-marrow transplant to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the\nfirst person to receive successful treatment based on a whole-exome sequencing diagnosis. Today, human genome sequencing is\nmore readily available and results are available within two days for about $1000.\nStrategies Used in Sequencing Projects\nThe basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known as the\ndideoxy method), which Fred Sanger developed in the 1970s. The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single-\nstranded template by using a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide (dNTP), which is a monomer, or a single DNA unit. The\nprimer and dNTP mix with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The ddNTPs are\nmonomers that are missing a hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain\n(Figure 17.13). Scientists label each ddNTP with a different color of fluorophore. Every time a ddNTP incorporates in the growing\ncomplementary strand, it terminates the DNA replication process, which results in multiple short strands of replicated DNA\n17.3 \u2022 Whole-Genome Sequencing\n431\nthat each terminate at a different point during replication. When gel electrophoresis processes the reaction mixture after\nseparating into single strands, the multiple newly replicated DNA strands form a ladder because of the differing sizes. Because\nthe ddNTPs are fluorescently labeled, each band on the gel reflects the DNA strand\u2019s size and the ddNTP that terminated the\nreaction. The different colors of the fluorophore-labeled ddNTPs help identify the ddNTP incorporated at that position. Reading\nthe gel on the basis of each band\u2019s color on the ladder produces the template strand\u2019s sequence (Figure 17.14).\nFigure 17.13 A dideoxynucleotide is similar in structure to a deoxynucleotide, but is missing the 3' hydroxyl group (indicated by the box).\nWhen a dideoxynucleotide is incorporated into a DNA strand, DNA synthesis stops.\nFigure 17.14 This figure illustrates Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method. Using dideoxynucleotides, the DNA fragment can\nterminate at different points. The DNA separates on the basis of size, and we can read these bands based on the fragments\u2019 size.\nEarly Strategies: Shotgun Sequencing and Pair-Wise End Sequencing\nIn shotgun sequencing method, several DNA fragment copies cut randomly into many smaller pieces (somewhat like what\nhappens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun). All of the segments sequence using the chain-sequencing\nmethod. Then, with sequence computer assistance, scientists can analyze the fragments to see where their sequences overlap.\nBy matching overlapping sequences at each fragment\u2019s end, scientists can reform the entire DNA sequence. A larger sequence\nthat is assembled from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig. As an analogy, consider that someone has four copies of\na landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should appear. The person then rips up\neach photograph with their hands, so that different size pieces are present from each copy. The person then mixes all of the\npieces together and asks you to reconstruct the photograph. In one of the smaller pieces you see a mountain. In a larger piece,\nyou see that the same mountain is behind a lake. A third fragment shows only the lake, but it reveals that there is a cabin on the\nshore of the lake. Therefore, from looking at the overlapping information in these three fragments, you know that the picture\ncontains a mountain behind a lake that has a cabin on its shore. This is the principle behind reconstructing entire DNA\nsequences using shotgun sequencing.\n432\nChapter 17 \u2022 Biotechnology and Genomics\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nOriginally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps. This was sufficient for sequencing small\ngenomes. However, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to developing double-barrel shotgun\nsequencing, or pairwise-end sequencing. In pairwise-end sequencing, scientists analyze each fragment\u2019s end for overlap.\nPairwise-end sequencing is, therefore, more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing, but it is easier to reconstruct the sequence\nbecause there is more available information.\nNext-generation Sequencing\nSince 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of next-generation sequencing,\nwhich is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing. These automated low-cost sequencers can generate\nsequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day. These\nsequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome process of putting all the fragments in order.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nComparing Sequences\nA sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, DNA, or RNA. Scientists use it to identify similar regions between cell\ntypes or species, which may indicate function or structure conservation. We can use sequence alignments to construct\nphylogenetic trees. The following website uses a software program called BLAST (basic local alignment search tool)\n(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) .\nUnder \u201cBasic Blast,\u201d click \u201cNucleotide Blast.\u201d Input the following sequence into the large \"query sequence\" box:\nATTGCTTCGATTGCA. Below the box, locate the \"Species\" field and type \"human\" or \"Homo sapiens\". Then click \u201cBLAST\u201d to\ncompare the inputted sequence against the human genome\u2019s known sequences. The result is that this sequence occurs in over a\nhundred places in the human genome. Scroll down below the graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see a short\ndescription of each of the matching hits. Pick one of the hits near the top of the list and click on \"Graphics\". This will bring you to\na page that shows the sequence\u2019s location within the entire human genome. You can move the slider that looks like a green flag\nback and forth to view the sequences immediately around the selected gene. You can then return to your selected sequence by\nclicking the \"ATG\" button.\nUse of Whole-Genome Sequences of Model Organisms\nBritish biochemist and Nobel Prize winner Fred Sanger used a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage fx174 (5368 base pairs), to\ncompletely sequence the first genome. Other scientists later sequenced several other organelle and viral genomes. American\nbiotechnologist, biochemist, geneticist, and businessman Craig Venter sequenced the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae in the\n1980s. Approximately 74 different laboratories collaborated on sequencing the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,\nwhich began in 1989 and was completed in 1996, because it was 60 times bigger than any other genome sequencing. By 1997, the\ngenome sequences of two important model organisms were available: the bacterium Escherichia coli K12 and the yeast\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae. We now know the genomes of other model organisms, such as the mouse Mus musculus, the fruit fly\nDrosophila melanogaster, the nematode Caenorhabditis. elegans, and humans Homo sapiens. Researchers perform extensive\nbasic research in model organisms because they can apply the information to genetically similar organisms. A model organism\nis a species that researchers use as a model to understand the biological processes in other species that the model organism\nrepresents. Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms. The process of\nattaching biological information to gene sequences is genome annotation. Annotating gene sequences helps with basic\nexperiments in molecular biology, such as designing PCR primers and RNA targets.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick through each genome sequencing step at this site (http://openstax.org/l/DNA_sequence) .\nGenome Sequence Uses\nDNA microarrays are methods that scientists use to detect gene expression by analyzing different DNA fragments that are fixed\nto a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and sequences. We can discover almost one million genotypic\nabnormalities using microarrays; whereas, whole-genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs in\n17.3 \u2022 Whole-Genome Sequencing\n433\nthe human genome. Although studying genome sequencing medical applications is interesting, this discipline dwells on\nabnormal gene function. Knowing about the entire genome will allow researchers to discover future onset diseases and other\ngenetic disorders early. This will allow for more informed decisions about lifestyle, medication, and having children. Genomics\nis still in its infancy, although someday it may become routine to use whole-genome sequencing to screen every newborn to\ndetect genetic abnormalities.\nIn addition to disease and medicine, genomics can contribute to developing novel enzymes that convert biomass to biofuel,\nwhich results in higher crop and fuel production, and lower consumer cost. This knowledge should allow better methods of\ncontrol over the microbes that industry uses to produce biofuels. Genomics could also improve monitoring methods that\nmeasure the impact of pollutants on ecosystems and help clean up environmental contaminants. Genomics has aided in\ndeveloping agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals that could benefit medical science and agriculture.\nIt sounds great to have all the knowledge we can get from whole-genome sequencing; however, humans have a responsibility to\nuse this knowledge wisely. Otherwise, it could be easy to misuse the power of such knowledge, leading to discrimination based\non a person's genetics, human genetic engineering, and other ethical concerns. This information could also lead to legal issues\nregarding health and privacy.\n17.4 Applying Genomics\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain pharmacogenomics\n\u2022\nDefine polygenic\nIntroducing DNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing projects, particularly the Human Genome project, has expanded\nthe applicability of DNA sequence information. Many fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial\ngenomics are using genomics. Understanding and finding cures for diseases is the most common application of genomics.\nPredicting Disease Risk at the Individual Level\nPredicting disease risk involves screening currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual level. Health care\nprofessionals can recommend intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs before disease onset. However, this approach is\nmost applicable when the problem resides within a single gene defect. Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of\ndiseases in developed countries. Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multi-factored or polygenic, which is a\nphenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve environmental factors such as diet. In April 2010,\nscientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a scientist at Stanford\nUniversity, who had his genome sequenced. The analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases. The medical team\nperformed a risk assessment to analyze Quake\u2019s percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions. The team found a rare\ngenetic mutation, which showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. The results also predicted that Quake had a 23 percent\nrisk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s. The scientists used databases and several\npublications to analyze the genomic data. Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and analytical tools\nare becoming more reliable, researchers still must address ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level.\n434\nChapter 17 \u2022 Biotechnology and Genomics\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 17.15 PCA3 is a gene that is expressed in prostate epithelial cells and overexpressed in cancerous cells. A high PCA3 concentration\nin urine is indicative of prostate cancer. The PCA3 test is a better indicator of cancer than the more well known PSA test, which measures\nthe level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) in the blood.\nIn 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for\nprostate cancer. Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death from prostate\ncancer. Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer treatment can have severe side\neffects. The PCA3 test is more accurate, but screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer\nitself suffering side effects from treatment. What do you think? Should all healthy men receive prostate cancer screenings using\nthe PCA3 or PSA test? Should people in general receive screenings to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other\ndiseases?\nPharmacogenomics and Toxicogenomics\nPharmacogenomics, or toxicogenomics, involves evaluating drug effectiveness and safety on the basis of information from an\nindividual's genomic sequence. We can study genomic responses to drugs using experimental animals (such as laboratory rats\nor mice) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans. Studying changes in gene expression could\nprovide information about the transcription profile in the drug's presence, which we can use as an early indicator of the\npotential for toxic effects. For example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to\ncancerous cell growth. Genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity. Medical professionals can\nuse personal genome sequence information to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on the basis of\nthe individual patient\u2019s genotype. The gene signatures may not be completely accurate, but medical professionals can test them\nfurther before pathologic symptoms arise.\nMicrobial Genomics: Metagenomics\nTraditionally, scholars have taught microbiology with the view that it is best to study microorganisms under pure culture\nconditions. This involves isolating a single cell type and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through\nseveral generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. In\naddition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist culturing in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities,\nbut in microbial communities or biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study\nmicroorganisms. Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an\nenvironmental niche. Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on\nthe environment (Figure 17.16).\n17.4 \u2022 Applying Genomics\n435\nFigure 17.16 Metagenomics involves isolating DNA from multiple species within an environmental niche.\nMicrobial Genomics: Creation of New Biofuels\nKnowledge of the genomics of microorganisms is being used to find better ways to harness biofuels from algae and\ncyanobacteria. The primary sources of fuel today are coal, oil, wood, and other plant products, such as ethanol. Although plants\nare renewable resources, there is still a need to find more alternative renewable sources of energy to meet our population\u2019s\nenergy demands. The microbial world is one of the largest resources for genes that encode new enzymes and produce new\norganic compounds, and it remains largely untapped. Microorganisms are used to create products, such as enzymes that are\nused in research, antibiotics, and other antimicrobial mechanisms. Microbial genomics is helping to develop diagnostic tools,\nimproved vaccines, new disease treatments, and advanced environmental cleanup techniques.\nMitochondrial Genomics\nMitochondria are intracellular organelles that contain their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a rapid rate and scientists\noften use it to study evolutionary relationships. Another feature that makes studying the mitochondrial genome interesting is\nthat the mitochondrial DNA in most multicellular organisms passes from the mother during the fertilization process. For this\nreason, scientists often use mitochondrial genomics to trace genealogy.\nExperts have used information and clues from DNA samples at crime scenes as evidence in court cases, and they have used\ngenetic markers in forensic analysis. Genomic analysis has also become useful in this field. The first publication showcasing the\nfirst use of genomics in forensics came out in 2001. It was a collaborative attempt between academic research institutions and\nthe FBI to solve the mysterious cases of anthrax communicated via the US Postal Service. Using microbial genomics, researchers\ndetermined that the culprit used a specific anthrax strain in all the mailings.\nGenomics in Agriculture\nGenomics can reduce the trials and failures involved in scientific research to a certain extent, which could improve agricultural\ncrop yield quality and quantity. Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps improve crop breeding to generate hybrids with\nthe most desirable qualities. Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then transfer those traits to a different\norganism. Researchers are discovering how genomics can improve agricultural production's quality and quantity. For example,\nscientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing product, such as making a drought-\nsensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season.\n436\nChapter 17 \u2022 Biotechnology and Genomics\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n17.5 Genomics and Proteomics\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain systems biology\n\u2022\nDescribe a proteome\n\u2022\nDefine protein signature\nProteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function that the gene encodes. Amino acids comprise proteins\nand play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to affect the rate of\nreactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as hemoglobin, help\ntransport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins. In the diseased state,\nprotein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a specific protein.\nA proteome is the entire set of proteins that a cell type produces. We can study proteoms using the knowledge of genomes\nbecause genes code for mRNAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins. Although mRNA analysis is a step in the right direction, not all\nmRNAs are translated into proteins. Proteomics is the study of proteomes' function. Proteomics complements genomics and is\nuseful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that they based on genes. Even though all multicellular organisms' cells have\nthe same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression. Thus, the\ngenome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within an organism. In addition, RNAs can be alternately spliced\n(cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins) and many proteins modify themselves after translation by\nprocesses such as proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination. There are also protein-protein\ninteractions, which complicate studying proteomes. Although the genome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends\non several factors that can change the progression of events that generate the proteome.\nMetabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics. Metabolomics involves studying small molecule metabolites in an\norganism. The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to an organism's genetic makeup. Metabolomics\noffers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics, as well as genetic makeup and environmental\nfactors. The goal of metabolome research is to identify, quantify, and catalogue all the metabolites in living organisms' tissues\nand fluids.\nBasic Techniques in Protein Analysis\nThe ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under specific conditions,\nstudy the interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug targets. Just as\nscientists analyze the genome using the basic DNA sequencing technique, proteomics requires techniques for protein analysis.\nThe basic technique for protein analysis, analogous to DNA sequencing, is mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry identifies and\ndetermines a molecule's characteristics. Advances in spectrometry have allowed researchers to analyze very small protein\nsamples. X-ray crystallography, for example, enables scientists to determine a protein crystal's three-dimensional structure at\natomic resolution. Another protein imaging technique, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), uses atoms' magnetic properties to\ndetermine the protein's three-dimensional structure in aqueous solution. Scientists have also used protein microarrays to study\nprotein interactions. Large-scale adaptations of the basic two-hybrid screen (Figure 17.17) have provided the basis for protein\nmicroarrays. Scientists use computer software to analyze the vast amount of data for proteomic analysis.\nGenomic- and proteomic-scale analyses are part of systems biology, which is the study of whole biological systems (genomes\nand proteomes) based on interactions within the system. The European Bioinformatics Institute and the Human Proteome\nOrganization (HUPO) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile of systems biology data.\nBecause proteins are the direct products of genes and reflect activity at the genomic level, it is natural to use proteomes to\ncompare the protein profiles of different cells to identify proteins and genes involved in disease processes. Most pharmaceutical\ndrug trials target proteins. Researchers use information that they obtain from proteomics to identify novel drugs and to\nunderstand their mechanisms of action.\n17.5 \u2022 Genomics and Proteomics\n437\nFigure 17.17 Scientists use two-hybrid screening to determine whether two proteins interact. In this method, a transcription factor splits\ninto a DNA-binding domain (BD) and an activator domain (AD). The binding domain is able to bind the promoter in the activator domain's\nabsence, but it does not turn on transcription. The bait protein attaches to the BD, and the prey protein attaches to the AD. Transcription\noccurs only if the prey \u201ccatches\u201d the bait.\nScientists are challenged when implementing proteomic analysis because it is difficult to detect small protein quantities.\nAlthough mass spectrometry is good for detecting small protein amounts, variations in protein expression in diseased states can\nbe difficult to discern. Proteins are naturally unstable molecules, which makes proteomic analysis much more difficult than\ngenomic analysis.\nCancer Proteomics\nResearchers are studying patients' genomes and proteomes to understand the genetic basis of diseases. The most prominent\ndisease researchers are studying with proteomic approaches is cancer. These approaches improve screening and early cancer\ndetection. Researchers are able to identify proteins whose expression indicates the disease process. An individual protein is a\nbiomarker; whereas, a set of proteins with altered expression levels is a protein signature. For a biomarker or protein signature\nto be useful as a candidate for early cancer screening and detection, they must secrete in body fluids, such as sweat, blood, or\nurine, such that health professionals can perform large-scale screenings in a noninvasive fashion. The current problem with\nusing biomarkers for early cancer detection is the high rate of false-negative results. A false negative is an incorrect test result\nthat should have been positive. In other words, many cancer cases go undetected, which makes biomarkers unreliable. Some\nexamples of protein biomarkers in cancer detection are CA-125 for ovarian cancer and PSA for prostate cancer. Protein\nsignatures may be more reliable than biomarkers to detect cancer cells. Researchers are also using proteomics to develop\nindividualized treatment plans, which involves predicting whether or not an individual will respond to specific drugs and the\nside effects that the individual may experience. Researchers also use proteomics to predict the possibility of disease recurrence.\nThe National Cancer Institute has developed programs to improve cancer detection and treatment. The Clinical Proteomic\nTechnologies for Cancer and the Early Detection Research Network are efforts to identify protein signatures specific to different\ncancer types. The Biomedical Proteomics Program identifies protein signatures and designs effective therapies for cancer\npatients.\n438\nChapter 17 \u2022 Biotechnology and Genomics\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nantibiotic resistance\nability of an organism to be\nunaffected by an antibiotic's actions\nbiomarker\nindividual protein that is uniquely produced in\na diseased state\nbiotechnology\nuse of biological agents for technological\nadvancement\ncDNA library\ncollection of cloned cDNA sequences\ncellular cloning\nproduction of identical cell populations by\nbinary fission\nchain termination method\nmethod of DNA sequencing\nusing labeled dideoxynucleotides to terminate DNA\nreplication;

Vaccines,\nantibiotics, and hormones are examples of products\nobtained by recombinant DNA technology. Scientists usually\ncreate transgenic plants to improve crop plant\ncharacteristics.\n17.2 Mapping Genomes\nGenome mapping is similar to solving a big, complicated\npuzzle with pieces of information coming from laboratories\nall over the world. Genetic maps provide an outline for\nlocating genes within a genome, and they estimate the\ndistance between genes and genetic markers on the basis of\nrecombination frequencies during meiosis. Physical maps\nprovide detailed information about the physical distance\nbetween the genes. The most detailed information is\navailable through sequence mapping. Researchers combine\ninformation from all mapping and sequencing sources to\nstudy an entire genome.\n17.3 Whole-Genome Sequencing\nWhole-genome sequencing is the latest available resource to\ntreat genetic diseases. Some doctors are using whole-\ngenome sequencing to save lives. Genomics has many\nindustrial applications including biofuel development,\nagriculture, pharmaceuticals, and pollution control. The\nbasic principle of all modern-day sequencing strategies\ninvolves the chain termination method of sequencing.\nAlthough the human genome sequences provide key insights\nto medical professionals, researchers use whole-genome\nsequences of model organisms to better understand the\nspecies' genome. Automation and the decreased cost of\nwhole-genome sequencing may lead to personalized\nmedicine in the future.\n17.4 Applying Genomics\nImagination is the only barrier to the applicability of\ngenomics. Researchers are applying genomics to most fields\nof biology. They use it for personalized medicine, prediction\nof disease risks at an individual level, studying drug\ninteractions before conducting clinical trials, and studying\nmicroorganisms in the environment as opposed to the\nlaboratory. They are also applying it to developments such as\ngenerating new biofuels, genealogical assessment using\n440\nChapter 17 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nmitochondria, advances in forensic science, and\nimprovements in agriculture.\n17.5 Genomics and Proteomics\nProteomics is the study of the entire set of proteins\nexpressed by a given type of cell under certain environmental\nconditions. In a multicellular organism, different cell types\nwill have different proteomes, and these will vary with\nenvironmental changes. Unlike a genome, a proteome is\ndynamic and in constant flux, which makes it both more\ncomplicated and more useful than the knowledge of\ngenomes alone.\nProteomics approaches rely on protein analysis. Researchers\nare constantly upgrading these techniques. Researchers have\nused proteomics to study different cancer types.

Scientists,\nphilosophers, researchers, and others had made suggestions and debated this topic well before Darwin\nbegan to explore this idea. Classical Greek philosopher Plato emphasized in his writings that species were\nstatic and unchanging, yet there were also ancient Greeks who expressed evolutionary ideas. In the\neighteenth century, naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon reintroduced ideas about the\nevolution of animals and observed that various geographic regions have different plant and animal\npopulations, even when the environments are similar. Some at this time also accepted that there were\nextinct species.\nAlso during the eighteenth century, James Hutton, a Scottish geologist and naturalist, proposed that\ngeological change occurred gradually by accumulating small changes from processes operating like they are\ntoday over long periods of time. This contrasted with the predominant view that the planet's geology was a\nconsequence of catastrophic events occurring during a relatively brief past. Nineteenth century geologist\nCharles Lyell popularized Hutton's view. A friend to Darwin. Lyell\u2019s ideas were influential on Darwin\u2019s\nthinking: Lyell\u2019s notion of the greater age of Earth gave more time for gradual change in species, and the\nprocess of change provided an analogy for this change. In the early nineteenth century, Jean-Baptiste\nLamarck published a book that detailed a mechanism for evolutionary change. We now refer to this\nmechanism as an inheritance of acquired characteristics by which the environment causes modifications in\nan individual, or offspring could use or disuse of a structure during its lifetime, and thus bring about change\nin a species. While many discredited this mechanism for evolutionary change, Lamarck\u2019s ideas were an\nimportant influence on evolutionary thought.\nCharles Darwin and Natural Selection\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, two naturalists, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, independently\nconceived and described the actual mechanism for evolution. Importantly, each naturalist spent time\nexploring the natural world on expeditions to the tropics. From 1831 to 1836, Darwin traveled around the\nworld on H.M.S. Beagle, including stops in South America, Australia, and the southern tip of Africa. Wallace\ntraveled to Brazil to collect insects in the Amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago\nfrom 1854 to 1862. Darwin\u2019s journey, like Wallace\u2019s later journeys to the Malay Archipelago, included stops at\nseveral island chains, the last being the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands west of Ecuador. On these islands, Darwin\nobserved species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had distinct differences. For\nexample, the ground finches inhabiting the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands comprised several species with a unique beak\nshape (Figure 18.2). The species on the islands had a graded series of beak sizes and shapes with very small\ndifferences between the most similar. He observed that these finches closely resembled another finch species\non the South American mainland. Darwin imagined that the island species might be species modified from\none of the original mainland species. Upon further study, he realized that each finch's varied beaks helped\nthe birds acquire a specific type of food. For example, seed-eating finches had stronger, thicker beaks for\nbreaking seeds, and insect-eating finches had spear-like beaks for stabbing their prey.\n444\nChapter 18 \u2022 Evolution and the Origin of Species\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 18.2 Darwin observed that beak shape varies among finch species. He postulated that ancestral species' beaks had adapted over\ntime to equip the finches to acquire different food sources.\nWallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and they independently developed the same explanation\nfor how and why such changes could take place. Darwin called this mechanism natural selection. Natural selection, or \u201csurvival\nof the fittest,\u201d is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of\nthose traits. This leads to evolutionary change.\nFor example, Darwin observed a population of giant tortoises in the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago to have longer necks than those that\nlived on other islands with dry lowlands. These tortoises were \u201cselected\u201d because they could reach more leaves and access more\nfood than those with short necks. In times of drought when fewer leaves would be available, those that could reach more leaves\nhad a better chance to eat and survive than those that couldn\u2019t reach the food source. Consequently, long-necked tortoises would\nbe more likely to be reproductively successful and pass the long-necked trait to their offspring. Over time, only long-necked\ntortoises would be present in the population.\nNatural selection, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature. First, most\ncharacteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring. Although no one, including Darwin and Wallace,\nknew how this happened at the time, it was a common understanding. Second, more offspring are produced than are able to\nsurvive, so resources for survival and reproduction are limited. The capacity for reproduction in all organisms outstrips the\navailability of resources to support their numbers. Thus, there is competition for those resources in each generation. Both\nDarwin and Wallace\u2019s understanding of this principle came from reading economist Thomas Malthus' essay that explained this\nprinciple in relation to human populations. Third, offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those\nvariations are inherited. Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics which allow them to best\ncompete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are less able to\ncompete. Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation. This will lead to\nchange in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called descent with modification. Ultimately, natural selection\nleads to greater adaptation of the population to its local environment. It is the only mechanism known for adaptive evolution.\nIn 1858, Darwin and Wallace (Figure 18.3) presented papers at the Linnean Society in London that discussed the idea of natural\nselection. The following year Darwin\u2019s book, On the Origin of Species, was published. His book outlined in considerable detail\nhis arguments for evolution by natural selection.\n18.1 \u2022 Understanding Evolution\n445\nFigure 18.3 Both (a) Charles Darwin and (b) Alfred Wallace wrote scientific papers on natural selection that they presented together at the\nLinnean Society in 1858.\nIt is difficult and time-consuming to document and present examples of evolution by natural selection. The Gal\u00e1pagos finches\nare an excellent example. Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have studied Gal\u00e1pagos finch populations every year\nsince 1976 and have provided important evidence of natural selection. The Grants found changes from one generation to the next\nin beak shape distribution with the medium ground finch on the Gal\u00e1pagos island of Daphne Major. The birds have inherited a\nvariation in their bill shape with some having wide deep bills and others having thinner bills. During a period in which rainfall\nwas higher than normal because of an El Ni\u00f1o, there was a lack of large hard seeds of which the large-billed birds ate; however,\nthere was an abundance of the small soft seeds which the small-billed birds ate. Therefore, the small-billed birds were able to\nsurvive and reproduce. In the years following this El Ni\u00f1o, the Grants measured beak sizes in the population and found that the\naverage bill size was smaller. Since bill size is an inherited trait, parents with smaller bills had more offspring and the bill\nevolved into a much smaller size. As conditions improved in 1987 and larger seeds became more available, the trend toward\nsmaller average bill size ceased.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nField Biologist\nMany people hike, explore caves, scuba dive, or climb mountains for recreation. People often participate in these activities\nhoping to see wildlife. Experiencing the outdoors can be incredibly enjoyable and invigorating. What if your job entailed\nworking in the wilderness? Field biologists by definition work outdoors in the \u201cfield.\u201d The term field in this case refers to any\nlocation outdoors, even under water. A field biologist typically focuses research on a certain species, group of organisms, or a\nsingle habitat (Figure 18.4).\n446\nChapter 18 \u2022 Evolution and the Origin of Species\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 18.4 A field biologist tranquilizes a polar bear for study. (credit: Karen Rhode)\nOne objective of many field biologists includes discovering new, unrecorded species. Not only do such findings expand our\nunderstanding of the natural world, but they also lead to important innovations in fields such as medicine and agriculture. Plant\nand microbial species, in particular, can reveal new medicinal and nutritive knowledge. Other organisms can play key roles in\necosystems or if rare require protection. When discovered, researchers can use these important species as evidence for\nenvironmental regulations and laws.\nProcesses and Patterns of Evolution\nNatural selection can only take place if there is variation, or differences, among individuals in a population. Importantly, these\ndifferences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, the selection will not lead to change in the next generation. This is critical\nbecause nongenetic reasons can cause variation among individuals such as an individual's height because of better nutrition\nrather than different genes.\nGenetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms: mutation and sexual reproduction. Mutation, a change in\nDNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population. The genetic changes that mutation causes\ncan have one of three outcomes on the phenotype. A mutation affects the organism's phenotype in a way that gives it reduced\nfitness\u2014lower likelihood of survival or fewer offspring. A mutation may produce a phenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness.\nMany mutations will also have no effect on the phenotype's fitness. We call these neutral mutations. Mutations may also have a\nwhole range of effect sizes on the organism's fitness that expresses them in their phenotype, from a small effect to a great effect.\nSexual reproduction also leads to genetic diversity: when two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to\nproduce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each offspring.\nWe call a heritable trait that helps an organism's survival and reproduction in its present environment an adaptation. Scientists\ndescribe groups of organisms adapting to their environment when a genetic variation occurs over time that increases or\nmaintains the population's \u201cfit\u201d to its environment. A platypus's webbed feet are an adaptation for swimming. A snow leopard's\nthick fur is an adaptation for living in the cold. A cheetah's fast speed is an adaptation for catching prey.\nWhether or not a trait is favorable depends on the current environmental conditions. The same traits are not always selected\nbecause environmental conditions can change. For example, consider a plant species that grew in a moist climate and did not\nneed to conserve water. Large leaves were selected because they allowed the plant to obtain more energy from the sun. Large\nleaves require more water to maintain than small leaves, and the moist environment provided favorable conditions to support\nlarge leaves. After thousands of years, the climate changed, and the area no longer had excess water. The direction of natural\nselection shifted so that plants with small leaves were selected because those populations were able to conserve water to survive\nthe new environmental conditions.\nThe evolution of species has resulted in enormous variation in form and function. Sometimes, evolution gives rise to groups of\norganisms that become tremendously different from each other. We call two species that evolve in diverse directions from a\n18.1 \u2022 Understanding Evolution\n447\ncommon point divergent evolution. We can see such divergent evolution in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering\nplants which share the same basic anatomies; however, they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical\nenvironments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators (Figure 18.5).\nFigure 18.5 Flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor. Notice that the (a) dense blazing star (Liatrus spicata) and the (b) purple\nconeflower (Echinacea purpurea) vary in appearance, yet both share a similar basic morphology. (credit a: modification of work by Drew\nAvery; credit b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\nIn other cases, similar phenotypes evolve independently in distantly related species. For example, flight has evolved in both bats\nand insects, and they both have structures we refer to as wings, which are adaptations to flight. However, bat and insect wings\nhave evolved from very different original structures. We call this phenomenon convergent evolution, where similar traits evolve\nindependently in species that do not share a common ancestry. The two species came to the same function, flying, but did so\nseparately from each other.\nThese physical changes occur over enormous time spans and help explain how evolution occurs. Natural selection acts on\nindividual organisms, which can then shape an entire species. Although natural selection may work in a single generation on an\nindividual, it can take thousands or even millions of years for an entire species' genotype to evolve. It is over these large time\nspans that life on earth has changed and continues to change.\nEvidence of Evolution\nThe evidence for evolution is compelling and extensive. Looking at every level of organization in living systems, biologists see\nthe signature of past and present evolution. Darwin dedicated a large portion of his book, On the Origin of Species, to\nidentifying patterns in nature that were consistent with evolution, and since Darwin, our understanding has become clearer\nand broader.\nFossils\nFossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those today, and fossils show a progression of\nevolution. Scientists determine the age of fossils and categorize them from all over the world to determine when the organisms\nlived relative to each other. The resulting fossil record tells the story of the past and shows the evolution of form over millions of\nyears (Figure 18.6). For example, scientists have recovered highly detailed records showing the evolution of humans and horses\n(Figure 18.6). The whale flipper shares a similar morphology to bird and mammal appendages (Figure 18.7) indicating that these\nspecies share a common ancestor.\n448\nChapter 18 \u2022 Evolution and the Origin of Species\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 18.6 In this (a) display, fossil hominids are arranged from oldest (bottom) to newest (top). As hominids evolved, the skull's shape\nchanged. An artist\u2019s rendition of (b) extinct species of the genus Equus reveals that these ancient species resembled the modern horse\n(Equus ferus) but varied in size.\nAnatomy and Embryology\nAnother type of evidence for evolution is the presence of structures in organisms that share the same basic form. For example,\nthe bones in human, dog, bird, and whale appendages all share the same overall construction (Figure 18.7) resulting from their\norigin in a common ancestor's appendages. Over time, evolution led to changes in the bones' shapes and sizes different species,\nbut they have maintained the same overall layout. Scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures.\nFigure 18.7 The similar construction of these appendages indicates that these organisms share a common ancestor.\nSome structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all, and appear to be residual parts from a past common\nancestor. We call these unused structures without function vestigial structures. Other examples of vestigial structures are wings\non flightless birds, leaves on some cacti, and hind leg bones in whales. Not all similarities represent homologous structures. As\nexplained in Determining Evolutionary Relationships, when similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints\nand not due to a close evolutionary relationship, it is an analogy or homoplasy. For example, insects use wings to fly like bats and\nbirds, but the wing structure and embryonic origin are completely different. These are analogous structures (Figure 20.8).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/bone_structures) exploring the bones in the human body.\nAnother evidence of evolution is the convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments. For example, species of\nunrelated animals, such as the arctic fox and ptarmigan, living in the arctic region have been selected for seasonal white\nphenotypes during winter to blend with the snow and ice (Figure 18.8). These similarities occur not because of common\nancestry, but because of similar selection pressures\u2014the benefits of predators not seeing them.\n18.1 \u2022 Understanding Evolution\n449\nFigure 18.8 The white winter coat of the (a) arctic fox and the (b) ptarmigan\u2019s plumage are adaptations to their environments. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Keith Morehouse)\nEmbryology, the study of the anatomy of an organism's development to its adult form, also provides evidence of relatedness\nbetween now widely divergent groups of organisms. Mutational tweaking in the embryo can have such magnified consequences\nin the adult that tends to conserve embryo formation. As a result, structures that are absent in some groups often appear in\ntheir embryonic forms and disappear when they reach the adult or juvenile form. For example, all vertebrate embryos, including\nhumans, exhibit gill slits and tails at some point in their early development. These disappear in the adults of terrestrial groups\nbut adult forms of aquatic groups such as fish and some amphibians maintain them. Great ape embryos, including humans,\nhave a tail structure during their development that they lose when they are born.\nBiogeography\nThe geographic distribution of organisms on the planet follows patterns that we can explain best by evolution in conjunction\nwith tectonic plate movement over geological time. Broad groups that evolved before the supercontinent Pangaea broke up\n(about 200 million years ago) are distributed worldwide. Groups that evolved since the breakup appear uniquely in regions of\nthe planet, such as the unique flora and fauna of northern continents that formed from the supercontinent Laurasia and of the\nsouthern continents that formed from the supercontinent Gondwana. The presence of members of the plant family Proteaceae\nin Australia, southern Africa, and South America was most predominant prior to the southern supercontinent Gondwana\nbreaking up.\nMarsupial diversification in Australia and the absence of other mammals reflect Australia\u2019s long isolation. Australia has an\nabundance of endemic species\u2014species found nowhere else\u2014which is typical of islands whose isolation by expanses of water\nprevents species to migrate. Over time, these species diverge evolutionarily into new species that look very different from their\nancestors that may exist on the mainland. Australia's marsupials, the Gal\u00e1pagos' finches, and many species on the Hawaiian\nIslands are all unique to their one point of origin, yet they display distant relationships to ancestral species on mainlands.\nMolecular Biology\nLike anatomical structures, the molecular structures of life reflect descent with modification. DNA's universality reflects\nevidence of a common ancestor for all of life. Fundamental divisions in life between the genetic code, DNA replication, and\nexpression are reflected in major structural differences in otherwise conservative structures such as ribosome components and\nmembrane structures. In general, the relatedness of groups of organisms is reflected in the similarity of their DNA\nsequences\u2014exactly the pattern that we would expect from descent and diversification from a common ancestor.\nDNA sequences have also shed light on some of the mechanisms of evolution. For example, it is clear that the evolution of new\nfunctions for proteins commonly occurs after gene duplication events that allow freely modifying one copy by mutation,\nselection, or drift (changes in a population\u2019s gene pool resulting from chance), while the second copy continues to produce a\nfunctional protein.\nMisconceptions of Evolution\nAlthough the theory of evolution generated some controversy when Darwin first proposed it, biologists almost universally\n450\nChapter 18 \u2022 Evolution and the Origin of Species\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\naccepted it, particularly younger biologists, within 20 years after publication of On the Origin of Species. Nevertheless, the\ntheory of evolution is a difficult concept and misconceptions about how it works abound.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis site (http://openstax.org/l/misconceptions) addresses some of the main misconceptions associated with the theory of\nevolution.\nEvolution Is Just a Theory\nCritics of the theory of evolution dismiss its importance by purposefully confounding the everyday usage of the word \u201ctheory\u201d\nwith the way scientists use the word. In science, we understand a \u201ctheory\u201d to be a body of thoroughly tested and verified\nexplanations for a set of observations of the natural world. Scientists have a theory of the atom, a theory of gravity, and the\ntheory of relativity, each which describes understood facts about the world. In the same way, the theory of evolution describes\nfacts about the living world. As such, a theory in science has survived significant efforts to discredit it by scientists. In contrast,\na \u201ctheory\u201d in common vernacular is a word meaning a guess or suggested explanation. This meaning is more akin to the\nscientific concept of \u201chypothesis.\u201d When critics of evolution say it is \u201cjust a theory,\u201d they are implying that there is little evidence\nsupporting it and that it is still in the process of rigorous testing. This is a mischaracterization.\nIndividuals Evolve\nEvolution is the change in a population's genetic composition over time, specifically over generations, resulting from differential\nreproduction of individuals with certain alleles. Individuals do change over their lifetime, obviously, but this is development and\ninvolves changes programmed by the set of genes the individual acquired at birth in coordination with the individual\u2019s\nenvironment. When thinking about the evolution of a characteristic, it is probably best to think about the change of the average\nvalue of the characteristic in the population over time. For example, when natural selection leads to bill-size change in medium\nground finches in the Gal\u00e1pagos, this does not mean that individual bills on the finches are changing. If one measures the\naverage bill size among all individuals in the population at one time and then measures them in the population several years\nlater, this average value will be different as a result of evolution. Although some individuals may survive from the first time to\nthe second, they will still have the same bill size; however, there will be many new individuals who contribute to the shift in\naverage bill size.\nEvolution Explains the Origin of Life\nIt is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of life\u2019s origins. Conversely, some of the theory\u2019s critics\nbelieve that it cannot explain the origin of life. The theory does not try to explain the origin of life. The theory of evolution\nexplains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species. It does not shed light on the beginnings\nof life including the origins of the first cells, which define life. Importantly, biologists believe that the presence of life on Earth\nprecludes the possibility that the events that led to life on Earth can repeat themselves because the intermediate stages would\nimmediately become food for existing living things.\nHowever, once a mechanism of inheritance was in place in the form of a molecule like DNA either within a cell or pre-cell, these\nentities would be subject to the principle of natural selection. More effective reproducers would increase in frequency at the\nexpense of inefficient reproducers. While evolution does not explain the origin of life, it may have something to say about some\nof the processes operating once pre-living entities acquired certain properties.\nOrganisms Evolve on Purpose\nStatements such as \u201corganisms evolve in response to a change in an environment\u201d are quite common, but such statements can\nlead to two types of misunderstandings. First, do not interpret the statement to mean that individual organisms evolve. The\nstatement is shorthand for \u201ca population evolves in response to a changing environment.\u201d However, a second misunderstanding\nmay arise by interpreting the statement to mean that the evolution is somehow intentional. A changed environment results in\nsome individuals in the population, those with particular phenotypes, benefiting and therefore producing proportionately more\noffspring than other phenotypes. This results in change in the population if the characteristics are genetically determined.\nIt is also important to understand that the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not arise\nin response to an environmental change. For example, applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria will, over time, select a\npopulation of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. The resistance, which a gene causes, did not arise by mutation because of\napplying the antibiotic. The gene for resistance was already present in the bacteria's gene pool, likely at a low frequency. The\nantibiotic, which kills the bacterial cells without the resistance gene, strongly selects individuals that are resistant, since these\n18.1 \u2022 Understanding Evolution\n451\nwould be the only ones that survived and divided. Experiments have demonstrated that mutations for antibiotic resistance do\nnot arise as a result of antibiotic.\nIn a larger sense, evolution is not goal directed. Species do not become \u201cbetter\u201d over time. They simply track their changing\nenvironment with adaptations that maximize their reproduction in a particular environment at a particular time. Evolution has\nno goal of making faster, bigger, more complex, or even smarter species, despite the commonness of this kind of language in\npopular discourse. What characteristics evolve in a species are a function of the variation present and the environment, both of\nwhich are constantly changing in a nondirectional way. A trait that fits in one environment at one time may well be fatal at some\npoint in the future. This holds equally well for insect and human species.\n18.2 Formation of New Species\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDefine species and describe how scientists identify species as different\n\u2022\nDescribe genetic variables that lead to speciation\n\u2022\nIdentify prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive barriers\n\u2022\nExplain allopatric and sympatric speciation\n\u2022\nDescribe adaptive radiation\nAlthough all life on earth shares various genetic similarities, only certain organisms combine genetic information by sexual\nreproduction and have offspring that can then successfully reproduce. Scientists call such organisms members of the same\nbiological species.\nSpecies and the Ability to Reproduce\nA species is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring. According to this definition,\none species is distinguished from another when, in nature, it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species\nto produce fertile offspring.\nMembers of the same species share both external and internal characteristics, which develop from their DNA. The closer\nrelationship two organisms share, the more DNA they have in common, just like people and their families. People\u2019s DNA is likely\nto be more like their father or mother\u2019s DNA than their cousin or grandparent\u2019s DNA. Organisms of the same species have the\nhighest level of DNA alignment and therefore share characteristics and behaviors that lead to successful reproduction.\nSpecies\u2019 appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate. For example, even though domestic dogs\n(Canis lupus familiaris) display phenotypic differences, such as size, build, and coat, most dogs can interbreed and produce\nviable puppies that can mature and sexually reproduce (Figure 18.9).\nFigure 18.9 The (a) poodle and (b) cocker spaniel can reproduce to produce a breed known as (c) the cockapoo. (credit a: modification of\nwork by Sally Eller, Tom Reese; credit b: modification of work by Jeremy McWilliams; credit c: modification of work by Kathleen Conklin)\nIn other cases, individuals may appear similar although they are not members of the same species. For example, even though\nbald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) are both birds and eagles, each belongs to a\nseparate species group (Figure 18.10). If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize a bald eagle's egg with an African fish\neagle's sperm and a chick did hatch, that offspring, called a hybrid (a cross between two species), would probably be\ninfertile\u2014unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity. Different species may have different genes that are active\nin development; therefore, it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions. Thus, even\n452\nChapter 18 \u2022 Evolution and the Origin of Species\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthough hybridization may take place, the two species still remain separate.\nFigure 18.10 The (a) African fish eagle is similar in appearance to the (b) bald eagle, but the two birds are members of different species.\n(credit a: modification of work by Nigel Wedge; credit b: modification of work by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)\nPopulations of species share a gene pool: a collection of all the gene variants in the species. Again, the basis to any changes in a\ngroup or population of organisms must be genetic for this is the only way to share and pass on traits. When variations occur\nwithin a species, they can only pass to the next generation along two main pathways: asexual reproduction or sexual\nreproduction. The change will pass on asexually simply if the reproducing cell possesses the changed trait. For the changed trait\nto pass on by sexual reproduction, a gamete, such as a sperm or egg cell, must possess the changed trait. In other words,\nsexually-reproducing organisms can experience several genetic changes in their body cells, but if these changes do not occur in a\nsperm or egg cell, the changed trait will never reach the next generation. Only heritable traits can evolve. Therefore,\nreproduction plays a paramount role for genetic change to take root in a population or species. In short, organisms must be able\nto reproduce with each other to pass new traits to offspring.\nSpeciation\nThe biological definition of species, which works for sexually reproducing organisms, is a group of actual or potential\ninterbreeding individuals. There are exceptions to this rule. Many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are possible\nand may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds. The presence in nature of hybrids\nbetween similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and the speciation process\nmay not yet be completed.\nGiven the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation: the formation of two species\nfrom one original species. Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only\nillustration in On the Origin of Species (Figure 18.11a). Compare this illustration to the diagram of elephant evolution (Figure\n18.11), which shows that as one species changes over time, it branches to form more than one new species, repeatedly, as long as\nthe population survives or until the organism becomes extinct.\nFigure 18.11 The only illustration in Darwin's On the Origin of Species is (a) a diagram showing speciation events leading to biological\ndiversity. The diagram shows similarities to phylogenetic charts that today illustrate the relationships of species. (b) Modern elephants\n18.2 \u2022 Formation of New Species\n453\nevolved from the Palaeomastodon, a species that lived in Egypt 35\u201350 million years ago.\nFor speciation to occur, two new populations must form from one original population and they must evolve in such a way that it\nbecomes impossible for individuals from the two new populations to interbreed. Biologists have proposed mechanisms by\nwhich this could occur that fall into two broad categories. Allopatric speciation (allo- = \"other\"; -patric = \"homeland\") involves\ngeographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution. Sympatric speciation (sym- = \"same\";\n-patric = \"homeland\") involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location.\nBiologists think of speciation events as the splitting of one ancestral species into two descendant species. There is no reason why\nmore than two species might not form at one time except that it is less likely and we can conceptualize multiple events as single\nsplits occurring close in time.\nAllopatric Speciation\nA geographically continuous population has a gene pool that is relatively homogeneous. Gene flow, the movement of alleles\nacross a species' range, is relatively free because individuals can move and then mate with individuals in their new location.\nThus, an allele's frequency at one end of a distribution will be similar to the allele's frequency at the other end. When populations\nbecome geographically discontinuous, it prevents alleles' free-flow. When that separation lasts for a period of time, the two\npopulations are able to evolve along different trajectories. Thus, their allele frequencies at numerous genetic loci gradually\nbecome increasingly different as new alleles independently arise by mutation in each population. Typically, environmental\nconditions, such as climate, resources, predators, and competitors for the two populations will differ causing natural selection\nto favor divergent adaptations in each group.\nIsolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways: a river forming a new branch, erosion\ncreating a new valley, a group of organisms traveling to a new location without the ability to return, or seeds floating over the\nocean to an island. The nature of the geographic separation necessary to isolate populations depends entirely on the organism's\nbiology and its potential for dispersal. If two flying insect populations took up residence in separate nearby valleys, chances are,\nindividuals from each population would fly back and forth continuing gene flow. However, if a new lake divided two rodent\npopulations continued gene flow would be unlikely; therefore, speciation would be more likely.\nBiologists group allopatric processes into two categories: dispersal and vicariance. Dispersal is when a few members of a species\nmove to a new geographical area, and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms.\nScientists have documented numerous cases of allopatric speciation taking place. For example, along the west coast of the\nUnited States, two separate spotted owl subspecies exist. The northern spotted owl has genetic and phenotypic differences from\nits close relative: the Mexican spotted owl, which lives in the south (Figure 18.12).\n454\nChapter 18 \u2022 Evolution and the Origin of Species\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 18.12 The northern spotted owl and the Mexican spotted owl inhabit geographically separate locations with different climates and\necosystems. The owl is an example of allopatric speciation. (credit \"northern spotted owl\": modification of work by John and Karen\nHollingsworth; credit \"Mexican spotted owl\": modification of work by Bill Radke)\nAdditionally, scientists have found that the further the distance between two groups that once were the same species, the more\nlikely it is that speciation will occur. This seems logical because as the distance increases, the various environmental factors\nwould likely have less in common than locations in close proximity. Consider the two owls: in the north, the climate is cooler\nthan in the south. The types of organisms in each ecosystem differ, as do their behaviors and habits. Also, the hunting habits and\nprey choices of the southern owls vary from the northern owls. These variances can lead to evolved differences in the owls, and\nspeciation likely will occur.\nAdaptive Radiation\nIn some cases, a population of one species disperses throughout an area, and each finds a distinct niche or isolated habitat.\nOver time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species. We call\nthis adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin; thus, causing the species to radiate into\nseveral new ones. Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because\nwater surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms. The Hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates\none example of adaptive radiation. From a single species, the founder species, numerous species have evolved, including the six\nin Figure 18.13.\n18.2 \u2022 Formation of New Species\n455\nFigure 18.13 The honeycreeper birds illustrate adaptive radiation. From one original species of bird, multiple others evolved, each with its\nown distinctive characteristics.\nNotice the differences in the species\u2019 beaks in Figure 18.13. Evolution in response to natural selection based on specific food\nsources in each new habitat led to evolution of a different beak suited to the specific food source. The seed-eating bird has a\nthicker, stronger beak which is suited to break hard nuts. The nectar-eating birds have long beaks to dip into flowers to reach the\nnectar. The insect-eating birds have beaks like swords, appropriate for stabbing and impaling insects. Darwin\u2019s finches are\nanother example of adaptive radiation in an archipelago.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/bird_evolution) to see how scientists use evidence to understand how birds evolved.\nSympatric Speciation\nCan divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in the same\nhabitat? The answer is yes. We call the process of speciation within the same space sympatric. The prefix \u201csym\u201d means same, so\n\u201csympatric\u201d means \u201csame homeland\u201d in contrast to \u201callopatric\u201d meaning \u201cother homeland.\u201d Scientists have proposed and studied\nmany mechanisms.\nOne form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division\nevent chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. However,\nsometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a condition that we\ncall aneuploidy (Figure 18.14).\n456\nChapter 18 \u2022 Evolution and the Origin of Species\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 18.14 Aneuploidy results when the gametes have too many or too few chromosomes due to nondisjunction during meiosis. In this\nexample, the resulting offspring will have 2n+1 or 2n-1 chromosomes.\nWhich is most likely to survive, offspring with 2n+1 chromosomes or offspring with 2n-1 chromosomes?\nPolyploidy is a condition in which a cell or organism has an extra set, or sets, of chromosomes. Scientists have identified two\nmain types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploidy state. Reproductive isolation is\nthe inability to interbreed. In some cases, a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its\nown species in a condition that we call autopolyploidy (Figure 18.15). The prefix \u201cauto-\u201d means \u201cself,\u201d so the term means multiple\nchromosomes from one\u2019s own species. Polyploidy results from an error in meiosis in which all of the chromosomes move into\none cell instead of separating.\nFigure 18.15 Autopolyploidy results when mitosis is not followed by cytokinesis.\nFor example, if a plant species with 2n = 6 produces autopolyploid gametes that are also diploid (2n = 6, when they should be n =\n3), the gametes now have twice as many chromosomes as they should have. These new gametes will be incompatible with the\nnormal gametes that this plant species produces. However, they could either self-pollinate or reproduce with other\nautopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number. In this way, sympatric speciation can occur quickly by\nforming offspring with 4n that we call a tetraploid. These individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of\nthis new kind and not those of the ancestral species.\nThe other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring that we call\nan allopolyploid. The prefix \u201callo-\u201d means \u201cother\u201d (recall from allopatric): therefore, an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from\ntwo different species combine. Figure 18.16 illustrates one possible way an allopolyploid can form. Notice how it takes two\n18.2 \u2022 Formation of New Species\n457\ngenerations, or two reproductive acts, before the viable fertile hybrid results.\nFigure 18.16 Alloploidy results when two species mate to produce viable offspring. In this example, a normal gamete from one species\nfuses with a polyploidy gamete from another. Two matings are necessary to produce viable offspring.\nThe cultivated forms of wheat, cotton, and tobacco plants are all allopolyploids. Although polyploidy occurs occasionally in\nanimals, it takes place most commonly in plants. (Animals with any of the types of chromosomal aberrations that we describe\nhere are unlikely to survive and produce normal offspring.) Scientists have discovered more than half of all plant species studied\nrelate back to a species evolved through polyploidy. With such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists hypothesize\nthat this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error.\nReproductive Isolation\nGiven enough time, the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence\nreproduction: if individuals of the two populations were brought together, mating would be less likely, but if mating occurred,\noffspring would be nonviable or infertile. Many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation, the ability to\ninterbreed, of the two populations.\nReproductive isolation can take place in a variety of ways. Scientists organize them into two groups: prezygotic barriers and\npostzygotic barriers. Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg: the first cell of an organism's development that reproduces sexually.\nTherefore, a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place. This includes barriers that prevent\nfertilization when organisms attempt reproduction. A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation. This includes\norganisms that don\u2019t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile.\nSome types of prezygotic barriers prevent reproduction entirely. Many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year,\noften just annually. Differences in breeding schedules, which we call temporal isolation, can act as a form of reproductive\nisolation. For example, two frog species inhabit the same area, but one reproduces from January to March; whereas, the other\nreproduces from March to May (Figure 18.17).\nFigure 18.17 These two related frog species exhibit temporal reproductive isolation. (a) Rana aurora breeds earlier in the year than (b)\nRana boylii. (credit a: modification of work by Mark R. Jennings, USFWS; credit b: modification of work by Alessandro Catenazzi)\n458\nChapter 18 \u2022 Evolution and the Origin of Species\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nIn some cases, populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer\noverlaps with the same species' other populations. We call this situation habitat isolation. Reproduction with the parent species\nceases, and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent. For example, a cricket population that\nwas divided after a flood could no longer interact with each other. Over time, natural selection forces, mutation, and genetic\ndrift will likely result in the two groups diverging (Figure 18.18).\nFigure 18.18 Speciation can occur when two populations occupy different habitats. The habitats need not be far apart. The cricket (a)\nGryllus pennsylvanicus prefers sandy soil, and the cricket (b) Gryllus firmus prefers loamy soil. The two species can live in close proximity,\nbut because of their different soil preferences, they became genetically isolated.\nBehavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction. For example, male\nfireflies use specific light patterns to attract females. Various firefly species display their lights differently. If a male of one\nspecies tried to attract the female of another, she would not recognize the light pattern and would not mate with the male.\nOther prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent fertilization from taking place.\nWe call this a gametic barrier. Similarly, in some cases closely related organisms try to mate, but their reproductive structures\nsimply do not fit together. For example, damselfly males of different species have differently shaped reproductive organs. If one\nspecies tries to mate with the female of another, their body parts simply do not fit together. (Figure 18.19).\nFigure 18.19 The shape of the male reproductive organ varies among male damselfly species, and is only compatible with the female of\nthat species. Reproductive organ incompatibility keeps the species reproductively isolated.\nIn plants, certain structures aimed to attract one type of pollinator simultaneously prevent a different pollinator from accessing\nthe pollen. The tunnel through which an animal must access nectar can vary widely in length and diameter, which prevents the\nplant from cross-pollinating with a different species (Figure 18.20).\nFigure 18.20 Some flowers have evolved to attract certain pollinators. The (a) wide foxglove flower is adapted for pollination by bees, while\nthe (b) long, tube-shaped trumpet creeper flower is adapted for pollination by hummingbirds.\n18.2 \u2022 Formation of New Species\n459\nWhen fertilization takes place and a zygote forms, postzygotic barriers can prevent reproduction. Hybrid individuals in many\ncases cannot form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages. We call this hybrid inviability\nbecause the hybrid organisms simply are not viable. In another postzygotic situation, reproduction leads to hybrid birth and\ngrowth that is sterile. Therefore, the organisms are unable to reproduce offspring of their own. We call this hybrid sterility.\nHabitat Influence on Speciation\nSympatric speciation may also take place in ways other than polyploidy. For example, consider a fish species that lives in a lake.\nAs the population grows, competition for food increases. Under pressure to find food, suppose that a group of these fish had the\ngenetic flexibility to discover and feed off another resource that other fish did not use. What if this new food source was located\nat a different depth of the lake? Over time, those feeding on the second food source would interact more with each other than the\nother fish; therefore, they would breed together as well. Offspring of these fish would likely behave as their parents: feeding and\nliving in the same area and keeping separate from the original population. If this group of fish continued to remain separate\nfrom the first population, eventually sympatric speciation might occur as more genetic differences accumulated between them.\nThis scenario does play out in nature, as do others that lead to reproductive isolation. One such place is Lake Victoria in Africa,\nfamous for its sympatric speciation of cichlid fish. Researchers have found hundreds of sympatric speciation events in these\nfish, which have not only happened in great number, but also over a short period of time. Figure 18.21 shows this type of\nspeciation among a cichlid fish population in Nicaragua. In this locale, two types of cichlids live in the same geographic location\nbut have come to have different morphologies that allow them to eat various food sources.\nFigure 18.21 Cichlid fish from Lake Apoyeque, Nicaragua, show evidence of sympatric speciation. Lake Apoyeque, a crater lake, is 1800\nyears old, but genetic evidence indicates that a single population of cichlid fish populated the lake only 100 years ago. Nevertheless, two\npopulations with distinct morphologies and diets now exist in the lake, and scientists believe these populations may be in an early stage of\nspeciation.\n18.3 Reconnection and Speciation Rates\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe pathways of species evolution in hybrid zones\n\u2022\nExplain the two major theories on rates of speciation\nSpeciation occurs over a span of evolutionary time, so when a new species arises, there is a transition period during which the\nclosely related species continue to interact.\nReconnection\nAfter speciation, two species may recombine or even continue interacting indefinitely. Individual organisms will mate with any\nnearby individual with whom they are capable of breeding. We call an area where two closely related species continue to interact\nand reproduce, forming hybrids a hybrid zone. Over time, the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids\nand the reproductive barriers (Figure 18.22). If the hybrids are less fit than the parents, speciation reinforcement occurs, and the\nspecies continue to diverge until they can no longer mate and produce viable offspring. If reproductive barriers weaken, fusion\noccurs and the two species become one. Barriers remain the same if hybrids are fit and reproductive: stability may occur and\nhybridization continues.\n460\nChapter 18 \u2022 Evolution and the Origin of Species\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 18.22 After speciation has occurred, the two separate but closely related species may continue to produce offspring in an area\ncalled the hybrid zone. Reinforcement, fusion, or stability may result, depending on reproductive barriers and the relative fitness of the\nhybrids.\nIf two species eat a different diet but one of the food sources is eliminated and both species are forced to eat the same foods,\nwhat change in the hybrid zone is most likely to occur?\nHybrids can be either less fit than the parents, more fit, or about the same. Usually hybrids tend to be less fit; therefore, such\nreproduction diminishes over time, nudging the two species to diverge further in a process we call reinforcement. Scientists use\nthis term because the hybrids' low success reinforces the original speciation. If the hybrids are as fit or more fit than the parents,\nthe two species may fuse back into one species (Figure 18.23). Scientists have also observed that sometimes two species will\nremain separate but also continue to interact to produce some individuals. Scientists classify this as stability because no real net\nchange is taking place.\nVarying Rates of Speciation\nScientists around the world study speciation, documenting observations both of living organisms and those found in the fossil\nrecord. As their ideas take shape and as research reveals new details about how life evolves, they develop models to help explain\nspeciation rates. In terms of how quickly speciation occurs, we can observe two current patterns: gradual speciation model and\npunctuated equilibrium model.\nIn the gradual speciation model, species diverge gradually over time in small steps. In the punctuated equilibrium model, a\nnew species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species, and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time\nafterward (Figure 18.23). We call this early change model punctuated equilibrium, because it begins with a punctuated or\nperiodic change and then remains in balance afterward. While punctuated equilibrium suggests a faster tempo, it does not\nnecessarily exclude gradualism.\n18.3 \u2022 Reconnection and Speciation Rates\n461\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 18.23 In (a) gradual speciation, species diverge at a slow, steady pace as traits change incrementally. In (b) punctuated equilibrium,\nspecies diverge quickly and then remain unchanged for long periods of time.\nWhich of the following statements is false?\na.\nPunctuated equilibrium is most likely to occur in a small population that experiences a rapid change in its environment.\nb.\nPunctuated equilibrium is most likely to occur in a large population that lives in a stable climate.\nc.\nGradual speciation is most likely to occur in species that live in a stable climate.\nd.\nGradual speciation and punctuated equilibrium both result in the divergence of species.\nThe primary influencing factor on changes in speciation rate is environmental conditions. Under some conditions, selection\noccurs quickly or radically. Consider a species of snails that had been living with the same basic form for many thousands of\nyears. Layers of their fossils would appear similar for a long time. When a change in the environment takes place\u2014such as a\ndrop in the water level\u2014a small number of organisms are separated from the rest in a brief period of time, essentially forming\none large and one tiny population. The tiny population faces new environmental conditions. Because its gene pool quickly\nbecame so small, any variation that surfaces and that aids in surviving the new conditions becomes the predominant form.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/snails) to continue the speciation story of the snails.\n462\nChapter 18 \u2022 Evolution and the Origin of Species\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nadaptation\nheritable trait or behavior in an organism that\naids in its survival and reproduction in its present\nenvironment\nadaptive radiation\nspeciation when one species radiates to\nform several other species\nallopatric speciation\nspeciation that occurs via geographic\nseparation\nallopolyploid\npolyploidy formed between two related, but\nseparate species\naneuploidy\ncondition of a cell having an extra chromosome\nor missing a chromosome for its species\nautopolyploid\npolyploidy formed within a single species\nbehavioral isolation\ntype of reproductive isolation that\noccurs when a specific behavior or lack of one prevents\nreproduction from taking place\nconvergent evolution\nprocess by which groups of\norganisms independently evolve to similar forms\ndispersal\nallopatric speciation that occurs when a few\nmembers of a species move to a new geographical area\ndivergent evolution\nprocess by which groups of organisms\nevolve in diverse directions from a common point\ngametic barrier\nprezygotic barrier occurring when closely\nrelated individuals of different species mate, but\ndifferences in their gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent\nfertilization from taking place\ngradual speciation model\nmodel that shows how species\ndiverge gradually over time in small steps\nhabitat isolation\nreproductive isolation resulting when\nspecies' populations move or are moved to a new habitat,\ntaking up residence in a place that no longer overlaps\nwith the same species' other populations\nhomologous structures\nparallel structures in diverse\norganisms that have a common ancestor\nhybrid\noffspring of two closely related individuals, not of\nthe same species\nhybrid zone\narea where two closely related species\ncontinue to interact and reproduce, forming hybrids\nnatural selection\nreproduction of individuals with\nfavorable genetic traits that survive environmental\nchange because of those traits, leading to evolutionary\nchange\npostzygotic barrier\nreproductive isolation mechanism that\noccurs after zygote formation\nprezygotic barrier\nreproductive isolation mechanism that\noccurs before zygote formation\npunctuated equilibrium\nmodel for rapid speciation that\ncan occur when an event causes a small portion of a\npopulation to be cut off from the rest of the population\nreinforcement\ncontinued speciation divergence between\ntwo related species due to low fitness of hybrids between\nthem\nreproductive isolation\nsituation that occurs when a species\nis reproductively independent from other species;\nbehavior, location, or reproductive barriers may cause\nthis to happen\nspeciation\nformation of a new species\nspecies\ngroup of populations that interbreed and produce\nfertile offspring\nsympatric speciation\nspeciation that occurs in the same\ngeographic space\ntemporal isolation\ndifferences in breeding schedules that\ncan act as a form of prezygotic barrier leading to\nreproductive isolation\nvariation\ngenetic differences among individuals in a\npopulation\nvestigial structure\nphysical structure present in an\norganism but that has no apparent function and appears\nto be from a functional structure in a distant ancestor\nvicariance\nallopatric speciation that occurs when\nsomething in the environment separates organisms of\nthe same species into separate groups\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n18.1 Understanding Evolution\nEvolution is the process of adaptation through mutation\nwhich allows more desirable characteristics to pass to the\nnext generation. Over time, organisms evolve more\ncharacteristics that are beneficial to their survival. For living\norganisms to adapt and change to environmental pressures,\ngenetic variation must be present. With genetic variation,\nindividuals have differences in form and function that allow\nsome to survive certain conditions better than others. These\norganisms pass their favorable traits to their offspring.\nEventually, environments change, and what was once a\ndesirable, advantageous trait may become an undesirable\ntrait and organisms may further evolve. Evolution may be\nconvergent with similar traits evolving in multiple species or\ndivergent with diverse traits evolving in multiple species that\ncame from a common ancestor. We can observe evidence of\nevolution by means of DNA code and the fossil record, and\nalso by the existence of homologous and vestigial structures.\n18.2 Formation of New Species\nSpeciation occurs along two main pathways: geographic\nseparation (allopatric speciation) and through mechanisms\nthat occur within a shared habitat (sympatric speciation).\nBoth pathways isolate a population reproductively in some\nform. Mechanisms of reproductive isolation act as barriers\nbetween closely related species, enabling them to diverge\nChapter 18 \u2022 Key Terms\n463\nand exist as genetically independent species. Prezygotic\nbarriers block reproduction prior to formation of a zygote;\nwhereas, postzygotic barriers block reproduction after\nfertilization occurs. For a new species to develop, something\nmust introduce a reproductive barrier. Sympatric speciation\ncan occur through errors in meiosis that form gametes with\nextra chromosomes (polyploidy). Autopolyploidy occurs\nwithin a single species; whereas, allopolyploidy occurs\nbetween closely related species.\n18.3 Reconnection and Speciation\nRates\nSpeciation is not a precise division: overlap between closely\nrelated species can occur in areas called hybrid zones.\nOrganisms reproduce with other similar organisms. The\nfitness of these hybrid offspring can affect the two species'\nevolutionary path. Scientists propose two models for the rate\nof speciation: one model illustrates how a species can change\nslowly over time. The other model demonstrates how change\ncan occur quickly from a parent generation to a new species.\nBoth models continue to follow natural selection patterns.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

Evolutionary theory states that humans, beetles, plants,\nand bacteria all share a common ancestor, but that millions of years of evolution have shaped each of\nthese organisms into the forms we see today. Scientists consider evolution a key concept to\nunderstanding life. It is one of the most dominant evolutionary forces. Natural selection acts to promote\ntraits and behaviors that increase an organism\u2019s chances of survival and reproduction, while eliminating\nthose traits and behaviors that are detrimental to the organism. However, natural selection can only, as\nits name implies, select\u2014it cannot create. We can attribute novel traits and behaviors to another\nevolutionary force\u2014mutation. Mutation and other sources of variation among individuals, as well as the\nevolutionary forces that act upon them, alter populations and species. This combination of processes has\nled to the world of life we see today.\nChapter Outline\n19.1 Population\nEvolution\n19.2 Population\nGenetics\n19.3 Adaptive Evolution\nAlfred Russel Wallace were developing their idea of natural selection. This lack of knowledge was a\nstumbling block to understanding many aspects of evolution. The predominant (and incorrect) genetic\ntheory of the time, blending inheritance, made it difficult to understand how natural selection might\noperate. Darwin and Wallace were unaware of the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel's 1866 publication\n\"Experiments in Plant Hybridization\", which came out not long after Darwin's book, On the Origin of\nSpecies. Scholars rediscovered Mendel\u2019s work in the early twentieth century at which time geneticists were\nrapidly coming to an understanding of the basics of inheritance. Initially, the newly discovered particulate\nnature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur. However,\nover the next few decades scientists integrated genetics and evolution in what became known as the modern\nsynthesis\u2014the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection and genetics that took\nshape by the 1940s. Generally, this concept is generally accepted today. In short, the modern synthesis\ndescribes how evolutionary processes, such as natural selection, can affect a population\u2019s genetic makeup,\nand, in turn, how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species. The theory also\nconnects population change over time (microevolution), with the processes that gave rise to new species and\nhigher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters, called (macroevolution).\nEveryday Connection\nEvolution and Flu Vaccines\nEvery fall, the media starts reporting on flu vaccinations and potential outbreaks. Scientists, health\nexperts, and institutions determine recommendations for different parts of the population, predict\noptimal production and inoculation schedules, create vaccines, and set up clinics to provide\ninoculations. You may think of the annual flu shot as media hype, an important health protection, or\njust a briefly uncomfortable prick in your arm. However, do you think of it in terms of evolution?\nThe media hype of annual flu shots is scientifically grounded in our understanding of evolution. Each\nyear, scientists across the globe strive to predict the flu strains that they anticipate as most widespread\nand harmful in the coming year. They base this knowledge on how flu strains have evolved over time and\nover the past few flu seasons. Scientists then work to create the most effective vaccine to combat those\nselected strains. Pharmaceutical companies produce hundreds of millions of doses in a short period in\norder to provide vaccinations to key populations at the optimal time.\nBecause viruses, like the flu, evolve very quickly (especially in evolutionary time), this poses quite a\nchallenge. Viruses mutate and replicate at a fast rate, so the vaccine developed to protect against last\nyear\u2019s flu strain may not provide the protection one needs against the coming year\u2019s strain. Evolution of\nthese viruses means continued adaptions to ensure survival, including adaptations to survive previous\nvaccines.\n468\nChapter 19 \u2022 The Evolution of Populations\nPopulation Genetics\nRecall that a gene for a particular character may have several alleles, or variants, that code for different traits \nassociated with that character. For example, in the ABO blood type system in humans, three alleles \ndetermine the particular blood-type carbohydrate on the surface of red blood cells. Each individual in a \npopulation of diploid organisms can only carry two alleles for a particular gene, but more than two may be \npresent in the individuals that comprise the population. Mendel followed alleles as they were inherited from \nparent to offspring. In the early twentieth century, biologists in the area of population genetics began to \nstudy how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic frequencies.\nThe allele frequency (or gene frequency) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population. \nUntil now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms, but \nbehind that phenotypic change is genetic change. In population genetics, scientists define the term \nevolution as a change in the allele's frequency in a population. Using the ABO blood type system as an \nexample, the frequency of one of the alleles, IA, is the number of copies of that allele divided by all the copies \nof the ABO gene in the population. For example, a study in Jordan1 found a frequency of IA to be 26.1 \npercent.\n1Sahar S. Hanania, Dhia S. Hassawi, and Nidal M. Irshaid, \u201cAllele Frequency and Molecular Genotypes of ABO Blood Group System in a Jordanian\nPopulation,\u201d Journal of Medical Sciences 7 (2007): 51-58, doi:10.3923/jms.2007.51.58.\nThe IB and I0 alleles comprise 13.4 percent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively, and all of the frequencies added up to 100\npercent. A change in this frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population.\nThe allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles become\nmore widespread than others during the natural selection process. Natural selection can alter the population\u2019s genetic makeup.\nAn example is if a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more offspring. Because\nmany of those offspring will also carry the beneficial allele, and often the corresponding phenotype, they will have more\noffspring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle. Over time, the allele will spread throughout the\npopulation. Some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way, meaning that every individual of the population will carry the\nallele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool. The gene\npool is the sum of all the alleles in a population.\nSometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele\nfrequencies. We call this phenomenon genetic drift. Natural selection and genetic drift usually occur simultaneously in\npopulations and are not isolated events. It is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible to\ndetermine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence. We call an event that initiates an allele frequency change\nin an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, the founder effect. Natural selection,\nrandom drift, and founder effects can lead to significant changes in a population's genome.\nHardy-Weinberg Principle of Equilibrium\nIn the early twentieth century, English mathematician Godfrey Hardy and German physician Wilhelm Weinberg stated the\nprinciple of equilibrium to describe the population's genetic makeup. The theory, which later became known as the Hardy-\nWeinberg principle of equilibrium, states that a population\u2019s allele and genotype frequencies are inherently stable\u2014 unless some\nkind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population, neither the allele nor the genotypic frequencies would change. The\nHardy-Weinberg principle assumes conditions with no mutations, migration, emigration, or selective pressure for or against\ngenotype, plus an infinite population. While no population can satisfy those conditions, the principle offers a useful model\nagainst which to compare real population changes.\nWorking under this theory, population geneticists represent different alleles as different variables in their mathematical\nmodels. The variable p, for example, often represents the frequency of a particular allele, say Y for the trait of yellow in Mendel\u2019s\npeas, while the variable q represents the frequency of y alleles that confer the color green. If these are the only two possible\nalleles for a given locus in the population, p + q = 1. In other words, all the p alleles and all the q alleles comprise all of the alleles\nfor that locus in the population.\nHowever, what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles, but the frequencies of the resulting\ngenotypes, known as the population\u2019s genetic structure, from which scientists can surmise phenotype distribution. If we\nobserve the phenotype, we can know only the homozygous recessive allele's genotype. The calculations provide an estimate of the\nremaining genotypes. Since each individual carries two alleles per gene, if we know the allele frequencies (p and q), predicting\nthe genotypes' frequencies is a simple mathematical calculation to determine the probability of obtaining these genotypes if we\ndraw two alleles at random from the gene pool. In the above scenario, an individual pea plant could be pp (YY), and thus produce\nyellow peas; pq (Yy), also yellow; or qq (yy), and thus produce green peas (Figure 19.2). In other words, the frequency of pp\nindividuals is simply p2; the frequency of pq individuals is 2pq; and the frequency of qq individuals is q2. Again, if p and q are\nthe only two possible alleles for a given trait in the population, these genotypes frequencies will sum to one: p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.\n19.1 \u2022 Population Evolution\n469\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 19.2 When populations are in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the allelic frequency is stable from generation to generation and we\ncan determine the allele distribution from the Hardy-Weinberg equation. If the allelic frequency measured in the field differs from the\npredicted value, scientists can make inferences about what evolutionary forces are at play.\nIn plants, violet flower color (V) is dominant over white (v). If p = 0.8 and q = 0.2 in a population of 500 plants, how many\nindividuals would you expect to be homozygous dominant (VV), heterozygous (Vv), and homozygous recessive (vv)? How many\nplants would you expect to have violet flowers, and how many would have white flowers?\nIn theory, if a population is at equilibrium\u2014that is, there are no evolutionary forces acting upon it\u2014generation after generation\nwould have the same gene pool and genetic structure, and these equations would all hold true all of the time. Of course, even\nHardy and Weinberg recognized that no natural population is immune to evolution. Populations in nature are constantly\nchanging in genetic makeup due to drift, mutation, possibly migration, and selection. As a result, the only way to determine the\nexact distribution of phenotypes in a population is to go out and count them. However, the Hardy-Weinberg principle gives\nscientists a mathematical baseline of a non-evolving population to which they can compare evolving populations and thereby\ninfer what evolutionary forces might be at play. If the frequencies of alleles or genotypes deviate from the value expected from\nthe Hardy-Weinberg equation, then the population is evolving.\n470\nChapter 19 \u2022 The Evolution of Populations\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse this online calculator (http://openstax.org/l/hardy-weinberg) to determine a population's genetic structure.\n19.2 Population Genetics\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the different types of variation in a population\n\u2022\nExplain why only natural selection can act upon heritable variation\n\u2022\nDescribe genetic drift and the bottleneck effect\n\u2022\nExplain how each evolutionary force can influence a population's allele frequencies\nA population's individuals often display different phenotypes, or express different alleles of a particular gene, which scientists\nrefer to as polymorphisms. We call populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics polymorphic. A number\nof factors, including the population\u2019s genetic structure and the environment (Figure 19.3) influence population variation, the\ndistribution of phenotypes among individuals. Understanding phenotypic variation sources in a population is important for\ndetermining how a population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures.\nFigure 19.3 The distribution of phenotypes in this litter of kittens illustrates population variation. (credit: Pieter Lanser)\nGenetic Variance\nNatural selection and some of the other evolutionary forces can only act on heritable traits, namely an organism\u2019s genetic code.\nBecause alleles are passed from parent to offspring, those that confer beneficial traits or behaviors may be selected, while\ndeleterious alleles may not. Acquired traits, for the most part, are not heritable. For example, if an athlete works out in the gym\nevery day, building up muscle strength, the athlete\u2019s offspring will not necessarily grow up to be a body builder. If there is a\ngenetic basis for the ability to run fast, on the other hand, a parent may pass this to a child.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nBefore Darwinian evolution became the prevailing theory of the field, French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck theorized that\norganisms could inherit acquired traits. While the majority of scientists have not supported this hypothesis, some have recently\nbegun to realize that Lamarck was not completely wrong. Visit this site (http://openstax.org/l/epigenetic) to learn more.\nHeritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that we can attribute to genetic differences, or genetic variance, among\nindividuals in a population. The greater the heritability of a population\u2019s phenotypic variation, the more susceptible it is to the\nevolutionary forces that act on heritable variation.\nWe call the diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population genetic variance. When scientists are involved in the breeding\nof a species, such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves, they try to increase a population\u2019s genetic variance to preserve as\nmuch of the phenotypic diversity as possible. This also helps reduce associated risks of inbreeding, the mating of closely related\nindividuals, which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause\n19.2 \u2022 Population Genetics\n471\nabnormalities and susceptibility to disease. For example, a disease that is caused by a rare, recessive allele might exist in a\npopulation, but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele. Because the allele is rare in a\nnormal, healthy population with unrestricted habitat, the chance that two carriers will mate is low, and even then, only 25\npercent of their offspring will inherit the disease allele from both parents. While it is likely to happen at some point, it will not\nhappen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population, and as a result, the\nallele maintains itself at low levels in the gene pool. However, if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other, this will\ndramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring, a phenomenon that\nscientists call inbreeding depression.\nChanges in allele frequencies that we identify in a population can shed light on how it is evolving. In addition to natural\nselection, there are other evolutionary forces that could be in play: genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, nonrandom mating, and\nenvironmental variances.\nGenetic Drift\nThe theory of natural selection stems from the observation that some individuals in a population are more likely to survive\nlonger and have more offspring than others; thus, they will pass on more of their genes to the next generation. A big, powerful\nmale gorilla, for example, is much more likely than a smaller, weaker one to become the population\u2019s silverback, the pack\u2019s\nleader who mates far more than the other males of the group. The pack leader will father more offspring, who share half of his\ngenes, and are likely to also grow bigger and stronger like their father. Over time, the genes for bigger size will increase in\nfrequency in the population, and the population will, as a result, grow larger on average. That is, this would occur if this\nparticular selection pressure, or driving selective force, were the only one acting on the population. In other examples, better\ncamouflage or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure.\nAnother way a population\u2019s allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift (Figure 19.4), which is simply the effect of\nchance. By chance, some individuals will have more offspring than others\u2014not due to an advantage conferred by some\ngenetically-encoded trait, but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time (when the receptive\nfemale walked by) or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (when a fox was hunting).\n472\nChapter 19 \u2022 The Evolution of Populations\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 19.4 Genetic drift in a population can lead to eliminating an allele from a population by chance. In this example, rabbits with the\nbrown coat color allele (B) are dominant over rabbits with the white coat color allele (b). In the first generation, the two alleles occur with\nequal frequency in the population, resulting in p and q values of .5. Only half of the individuals reproduce, resulting in a second generation\nwith p and q values of .7 and .3, respectively. Only two individuals in the second generation reproduce, and by chance these individuals are\nhomozygous dominant for brown coat color. As a result, in the third generation the recessive b allele is lost.\nDo you think genetic drift would happen more quickly on an island or on the mainland?\nSmall populations are more susceptible to the forces of genetic drift. Large populations, alternatively, are buffered against the\neffects of chance. If one individual of a population of 10 individuals happens to die at a young age before it leaves any offspring\nto the next generation, all of its genes\u20141/10 of the population\u2019s gene pool\u2014will be suddenly lost. In a population of 100, that\u2019s\n19.2 \u2022 Population Genetics\n473\nonly 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it is much less impactful on the population\u2019s genetic structure.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGo to this site (http://openstax.org/l/genetic_drift) to watch an animation of random sampling and genetic drift in action.\nNatural events, such as an earthquake disaster that kills\u2014at random\u2014a large portion of the population, can magnify genetic\ndrift. Known as the bottleneck effect, it results in suddenly wiping out a large portion of the genome (Figure 19.5). At once, the\nsurvivors' genetic structure becomes the entire population's genetic structure, which may be very different from the pre-disaster\npopulation.\nFigure 19.5 A chance event or catastrophe can reduce the genetic variability within a population.\nAnother scenario in which populations might experience a strong influence of genetic drift is if some portion of the population\nleaves to start a new population in a new location or if a physical barrier divides a population. In this situation, those individuals\nare an unlikely representation of the entire population, which results in the founder effect. The founder effect occurs when the\ngenetic structure changes to match that of the new population\u2019s founding fathers and mothers. Researchers believe that the\nfounder effect was a key factor in the genetic history of the Afrikaner population of Dutch settlers in South Africa, as evidenced\nby mutations that are common in Afrikaners but rare in most other populations. This is probably because a higher-than-normal\nproportion of the founding colonists carried these mutations. As a result, the population expresses unusually high incidences of\nHuntington\u2019s disease (HD) and Fanconi anemia (FA), a genetic disorder known to cause blood marrow and congenital\nabnormalities\u2014even cancer.2\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this short video to learn more about the founder and bottleneck effects.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/founder_bottle)\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION\nTesting the Bottleneck Effect\nQuestion: How do natural disasters affect a population's genetic structure?\n2A. J. Tipping et al., \u201cMolecular and Genealogical Evidence for a Founder Effect in Fanconi Anemia Families of the Afrikaner Population of South Africa,\u201d\nPNAS 98, no. 10 (2001): 5734-5739, doi: 10.1073/pnas.091402398.\n474\nChapter 19 \u2022 The Evolution of Populations\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nBackground: When an earthquake or hurricane suddenly wipes out much of a population, the surviving individuals are usually\na random sampling of the original group. As a result, the population's genetic makeup can change dramatically. We call this\nphenomenon the bottleneck effect.\nHypothesis: Repeated natural disasters will yield different population genetic structures; therefore, each time one runs this\nexperiment the results will vary.\nTest the hypothesis: Count out the original population using different colored beads. For example, red, blue, and yellow beads\nmight represent red, blue, and yellow individuals. After recording the number of each individual in the original population,\nplace them all in a bottle with a narrow neck that will only allow a few beads out at a time. Then, pour 1/3 of the bottle\u2019s contents\ninto a bowl. This represents the surviving individuals after a natural disaster kills a majority of the population. Count the\nnumber of the different colored beads in the bowl, and record it. Then, place all of the beads back in the bottle and repeat the\nexperiment four more times.\nAnalyze the data: Compare the five populations that resulted from the experiment. Do the populations all contain the same\nnumber of different colored beads, or do they vary? Remember, these populations all came from the same exact parent\npopulation.\nForm a conclusion: Most likely, the five resulting populations will differ quite dramatically. This is because natural disasters are\nnot selective\u2014they kill and spare individuals at random. Now think about how this might affect a real population. What\nhappens when a hurricane hits the Mississippi Gulf Coast? How do the seabirds that live on the beach fare?\nGene Flow\nAnother important evolutionary force is gene flow: the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of\nindividuals or gametes (Figure 19.6). While some populations are fairly stable, others experience more flux. Many plants, for\nexample, send their pollen far and wide, by wind or by bird, to pollinate other populations of the same species some distance\naway. Even a population that may initially appear to be stable, such as a pride of lions, can experience its fair share of\nimmigration and emigration as developing males leave their mothers to seek out a new pride with genetically unrelated females.\nThis variable flow of individuals in and out of the group not only changes the population's gene structure, but it can also\nintroduce new genetic variation to populations in different geological locations and habitats.\nFigure 19.6 Gene flow can occur when an individual travels from one geographic location to another.\nMutation\nMutations are changes to an organism\u2019s DNA and are an important driver of diversity in populations. Species evolve because of\nmutations accumulating over time. The appearance of new mutations is the most common way to introduce novel genotypic and\nphenotypic variance. Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are quickly eliminated from the population by natural\nselection. Others are beneficial and will spread through the population. Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is\ndetermined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and reproduce. Some mutations do not do anything and\ncan linger, unaffected by natural selection, in the genome. Some can have a dramatic effect on a gene and the resulting\nphenotype.\n19.2 \u2022 Population Genetics\n475\nNonrandom Mating\nIf individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers, the result can be a changing population. There are many reasons nonrandom\nmating occurs. One reason is simple mate choice. For example, female peahens may prefer peacocks with bigger, brighter tails.\nNatural selection picks traits that lead to more mating selections for an individual. One common form of mate choice, called\nassortative mating, is an individual\u2019s preference to mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves.\nAnother cause of nonrandom mating is physical location. This is especially true in large populations spread over vast geographic\ndistances where not all individuals will have equal access to one another. Some might be miles apart through woods or over\nrough terrain, while others might live immediately nearby.\nEnvironmental Variance\nGenes are not the only players involved in determining population variation. Other factors, such as the environment (Figure\n19.7) also influence phenotypes. A beachgoer is likely to have darker skin than a city dweller, for example, due to regular exposure\nto the sun, an environmental factor. For some species, the environment determines some major characteristics, such as gender.\nFor example, some turtles and other reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). TSD means that individuals\ndevelop into males if their eggs are incubated within a certain temperature range, or females at a different temperature range.\nFigure 19.7 The temperature at which the eggs are incubated determine the American alligator's (Alligator mississippiensis) sex. Eggs\nincubated at 30\u00b0C produce females, and eggs incubated at 33\u00b0C produce males. (credit: Steve Hillebrand, USFWS)\nGeographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those populations. We\nsee such geographical variation between most populations and it can be significant. We can observe one type of geographic\nvariation, a cline, as given species' populations vary gradually across an ecological gradient. Species of warm-blooded animals,\nfor example, tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth\u2019s poles, allowing them to better conserve heat.\nThis is a latitudinal cline. Alternatively, flowering plants tend to bloom at different times depending on where they are along a\nmountain slope. This is an altitudinal cline.\nIf there is gene flow between the populations, the individuals will likely show gradual differences in phenotype along the cline.\nRestricted gene flow, alternatively can lead to abrupt differences, even speciation.\n19.3 Adaptive Evolution\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain the different ways natural selection can shape populations\n\u2022\nDescribe how these different forces can lead to different outcomes in terms of the population variation\nNatural selection acts on the population\u2019s heritable traits: selecting for beneficial alleles that allow for environmental adaptation,\nand thus increasing their frequency in the population, while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their\nfrequency. Scientists call this process adaptive evolution. Natural selection acts on entire organisms, not on an individual allele\nwithin the organism. An individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that, for example, increases\nthe ability to reproduce (fecundity), but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease, that\nfecundity phenotype will not pass to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age. Natural\n476\nChapter 19 \u2022 The Evolution of Populations\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nselection acts at the individual's level. It selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next\ngeneration. Scientists call this an organism\u2019s evolutionary (Darwinian) fitness.\nFitness is often quantifiable and is measured by scientists in the field. However, it is not an individual's absolute fitness that\ncounts, but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population. Scientists call this concept relative fitness, which\nallows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation, and thus, how\nthe population might evolve.\nThere are several ways selection can affect population variation: stabilizing selection, directional selection, diversifying\nselection, frequency-dependent selection, and sexual selection. As natural selection influences the allele frequencies in a\npopulation, individuals can either become more or less genetically similar and the phenotypes can become more similar or more\ndisparate.\nStabilizing Selection\nIf natural selection favors an average phenotype, selecting against extreme variation, the population will undergo stabilizing\nselection (Figure 19.8). In a mouse population that live in the woods, for example, natural selection is likely to favor mice that\nbest blend in with the forest floor and are less likely for predators to spot. Assuming the ground is a fairly consistent shade of\nbrown, those mice whose fur is most closely matched to that color will be most likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their\ngenes for their brown coat. Mice that carry alleles that make them a bit lighter or a bit darker will stand out against the ground\nand be more likely to fall victim to predation. As a result of this selection, the population\u2019s genetic variance will decrease.\nDirectional Selection\nWhen the environment changes, populations will often undergo directional selection (Figure 19.8), which selects for phenotypes\nat one end of the spectrum of existing variation. A classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth\nin eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the moths were predominately light in color,\nwhich allowed them to blend in with the light-colored trees and lichens in their environment. However, as soot began spewing\nfrom factories, the trees darkened, and the light-colored moths became easier for predatory birds to spot. Over time, the\nfrequency of the moth's melanic form increased because they had a higher survival rate in habitats affected by air pollution\nbecause their darker coloration blended with the sooty trees. Similarly, the hypothetical mouse population may evolve to take on\na different coloration if something were to cause the forest floor where they live to change color. The result of this type of\nselection is a shift in the population\u2019s genetic variance toward the new, fit phenotype.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIn science, we sometimes believe some things are true, and then new information becomes available that changes our\nunderstanding. The peppered moth story is an example: some scientists recently have questioned the facts behind the selection\ntoward darker moths. Read this article (http://openstax.org/l/peppered_moths) to learn more.\nDiversifying Selection\nSometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages for natural selection, while the intermediate\nphenotypes are, on average, less fit. Scientists call this diversifying selection (Figure 19.8) We see this in many animal\npopulations that have multiple male forms. Large, dominant alpha males use brute force to obtain mates, while small males can\nsneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male\u2019s territory. In this case, both the alpha males and the\n\u201csneaking\u201d males will be selected for, but medium-sized males, who can\u2019t overtake the alpha males and are too big to sneak\ncopulations, are selected against. Diversifying selection can also occur when environmental changes favor individuals on either\nend of the phenotypic spectrum. Imagine a mouse population living at the beach where there is light-colored sand interspersed\nwith patches of tall grass. In this scenario, light-colored mice that blend in with the sand would be favored, as well as dark-\ncolored mice that can hide in the grass. Medium-colored mice, alternatively would not blend in with either the grass or the sand,\nand thus predators would most likely eat them. The result of this type of selection is increased genetic variance as the population\nbecomes more diverse.\n19.3 \u2022 Adaptive Evolution\n477\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 19.8 Different types of natural selection can impact the distribution of phenotypes within a population. In (a) stabilizing selection, an\naverage phenotype is favored. In (b) directional selection, a change in the environment shifts the spectrum of observed phenotypes. In (c)\ndiversifying selection, two or more extreme phenotypes are selected for, while the average phenotype is selected against.\nIn recent years, factories have become cleaner, and release less soot into the environment. What impact do you think this has\nhad on the distribution of moth color in the population?\nFrequency-Dependent Selection\nAnother type of selection, frequency-dependent selection, favors phenotypes that are either common (positive frequency-\ndependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-dependent selection). We can observe an interesting example of this type of\nselection in a unique group of Pacific Northwest lizards. Male common side-blotched lizards come in three throat-color\npatterns: orange, blue, and yellow. Each of these forms has a different reproductive strategy: orange males are the strongest and\ncan fight other males for access to their females. Blue males are medium-sized and form strong pair bonds with their mates.\nYellow males (Figure 19.9) are the smallest, and look a bit like females, which allows them to sneak copulations. Like a game of\nrock-paper-scissors, orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange in the competition for females. That is, the\nbig, strong orange males can fight off the blue males to mate with the blue\u2019s pair-bonded females, the blue males are successful\nat guarding their mates against yellow sneaker males, and the yellow males can sneak copulations from the potential mates of\nthe large, polygynous orange males.\n478\nChapter 19 \u2022 The Evolution of Populations\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 19.9 A yellow-throated side-blotched lizard is smaller than either the blue-throated or orange-throated males and appears a bit like\nthe females of the species, allowing it to sneak copulations. (credit: \u201ctinyfroglet\u201d/Flickr)\nIn this scenario, natural selection favors orange males when blue males dominate the population. Blue males will thrive when\nthe population is mostly yellow males, and yellow males will be selected for when orange males are the most populous. As a\nresult, populations of side-blotched lizards cycle in the distribution of these phenotypes\u2014in one generation, orange might\npredominate, and then yellow males will begin to rise in frequency. Once yellow males comprise a majority of the population,\nblue males will be selected. Finally, when blue males become common, orange males once again will be favored.\nNegative frequency-dependent selection serves to increase the population\u2019s genetic variance by selecting for rare phenotypes;\nwhereas, positive frequency-dependent selection usually decreases genetic variance by selecting for common phenotypes.\nSexual Selection\nMales and females of certain species are often quite different from one another in ways beyond the reproductive organs. Males\nare often larger, for example, and display many elaborate colors and adornments, like the peacock\u2019s tail, while females tend to be\nsmaller and duller in decoration. We call such differences sexual dimorphisms (Figure 19.10), which arise in many populations,\nparticularly animal populations, where there is more variance in the male's reproductive success than that of the females. That\nis, some males\u2014often the bigger, stronger, or more decorated males\u2014obtain the vast majority of the total matings, while others\nreceive none. This can occur because the males are better at fighting off other males, or because females will choose to mate with\nthe bigger or more decorated males. In either case, this variation in reproductive success generates a strong selection pressure\namong males to obtain those matings, resulting in the evolution of bigger body size and elaborate ornaments to attract the\nfemales\u2019 attention. Females, however, tend to achieve a handful of selected matings; therefore, they are more likely to select\nmore desirable males.\nSexual dimorphism varies widely among species, and some species are even sex-role reversed. In such cases, females tend to\nhave a greater variance in their reproductive success than males and are correspondingly selected for the bigger body size and\nelaborate traits usually characteristic of males.\n19.3 \u2022 Adaptive Evolution\n479\nFigure 19.10 Sexual dimorphism in (a) peacocks and peahens, (b) Argiope appensa spiders (the female spider is the large one), and in (c)\nwood ducks. (credit \u201cspiders\u201d: modification of work by \u201cSanba38\u201d/Wikimedia Commons; credit \u201cduck\u201d: modification of work by Kevin Cole)\nWe call the selection pressures on males and females to obtain matings sexual selection. It can result in developing secondary\nsexual characteristics that do not benefit the individual\u2019s likelihood of survival but help to maximize its reproductive success.\nSexual selection can be so strong that it selects traits that are actually detrimental to the individual\u2019s survival. Think, once again,\nabout the peacock\u2019s tail. While it is beautiful and the male with the largest, most colorful tail is more likely to win the female, it\nis not the most practical appendage. In addition to greater visibility to predators, it makes the males slower in their attempted\nescapes. There is some evidence that this risk is why females like the big tails in the first place. The speculation is that large tails\ncarry risk, and only the best males survive that risk: the bigger the tail, the more fit the male. We call this the handicap\nprinciple.\nThe good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism or their\nability to fight disease. Females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic superiority,\nwhich they will then pass on to their offspring. Although one may argue that females should not be picky because it will likely\nreduce their number of offspring, if better males father more fit offspring, it may be beneficial. Fewer, healthier offspring may\nincrease the chances of survival more than many, weaker offspring.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIn 1915, biologist Ronald Fisher proposed another model of sexual selection: the Fisherian runaway model (http://openstax.org/l/\nsexual_select) , which suggests that selection of certain traits is a result of sexual preference.\nIn both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis, the trait is an honest signal of the males\u2019 quality, thus giving\nfemales a way to find the fittest mates\u2014 males that will pass the best genes to their offspring.\nNo Perfect Organism\nNatural selection is a driving force in evolution and can generate populations that are better adapted to survive and successfully\nreproduce in their environments. However, natural selection cannot produce the perfect organism. Natural selection can only\nselect on existing variation in the population. It does not create anything from scratch. Thus, it is limited by a population\u2019s\nexisting genetic variance and whatever new alleles arise through mutation and gene flow.\nNatural selection is also limited because it works at the individual, not allele level, and some alleles are linked due to their\nphysical proximity in the genome, making them more likely to pass on together (linkage disequilibrium). Any given individual\nmay carry some beneficial and some unfavorable alleles. It is the alleles' net effect, or the organism\u2019s fitness, upon which natural\nselection can act. As a result, good alleles can be lost if individuals who carry them also have several overwhelmingly bad alleles.\nLikewise, bad alleles can be kept if individuals who have enough good alleles to result in an overall fitness benefit carry them.\nFurthermore, natural selection can be constrained by the relationships between different polymorphisms. One morph may\nconfer a higher fitness than another, but may not increase in frequency because going from the less beneficial to the more\nbeneficial trait would require going through a less beneficial phenotype. Think back to the mice that live at the beach. Some are\nlight-colored and blend in with the sand, while others are dark and blend in with the patches of grass. The dark-colored mice\nmay be, overall, more fit than the light-colored mice, and at first glance, one might expect the light-colored mice to be selected\nfor a darker coloration. However, remember that the intermediate phenotype, a medium-colored coat, is very bad for the\nmice\u2014they cannot blend in with either the sand or the grass and predators are more likely to eat them. As a result, the light-\n480\nChapter 19 \u2022 The Evolution of Populations\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncolored mice would not be selected for a dark coloration because those individuals who began moving in that direction (began\nselection for a darker coat) would be less fit than those that stayed light.\nFinally, it is important to understand that not all evolution is adaptive. While natural selection selects the fittest individuals and\noften results in a more fit population overall, other forces of evolution, including genetic drift and gene flow, often do the\nopposite: introducing deleterious alleles to the population\u2019s gene pool. Evolution has no purpose\u2014it is not changing a\npopulation into a preconceived ideal. It is simply the sum of the various forces that we have described in this chapter and how\nthey influence the population's genetic and phenotypic variance.\n19.3 \u2022 Adaptive Evolution\n481\n", "key_terms": "\nadaptive evolution\nincrease in frequency of beneficial\nalleles and decrease in deleterious alleles due to selection\nallele frequency\n(also, gene frequency) rate at which a\nspecific allele appears within a population\nassortative mating\nwhen individuals tend to mate with\nthose who are phenotypically similar to themselves\nbottleneck effect\nmagnification of genetic drift as a result\nof natural events or catastrophes\ncline\ngradual geographic variation across an ecological\ngradient\ndirectional selection\nselection that favors phenotypes at\none end of the spectrum of existing variation\ndiversifying selection\nselection that favors two or more\ndistinct phenotypes\nevolutionary fitness\n(also, Darwinian fitness) individual\u2019s\nability to survive and reproduce\nfounder effect\nevent that initiates an allele frequency\nchange in part of the population, which is not typical of\nthe original population\nfrequency-dependent selection\nselection that favors\nphenotypes that are either common (positive frequency-\ndependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-\ndependent selection)\ngene flow\nflow of alleles in and out of a population due to\nthe individual or gamete migration\ngene pool\nall the alleles that the individuals in the\npopulation carry\ngenetic drift\neffect of chance on a population\u2019s gene pool\ngenetic structure\ndistribution of the different possible\ngenotypes in a population\ngenetic variance\ndiversity of alleles and genotypes in a\npopulation\ngeographical variation\ndifferences in the phenotypic\nvariation between populations that are separated\ngeographically\ngood genes hypothesis\ntheory of sexual selection that\nargues individuals develop impressive ornaments to show\noff their efficient metabolism or ability to fight disease\nhandicap principle\ntheory of sexual selection that argues\nonly the fittest individuals can afford costly traits\nheritability\nfraction of population variation that can be\nattributed to its genetic variance\nhonest signal\ntrait that gives a truthful impression of an\nindividual\u2019s fitness\ninbreeding\nmating of closely related individuals\ninbreeding depression\nincrease in abnormalities and\ndisease in inbreeding populations\nmacroevolution\nbroader scale evolutionary changes that\nscientists see over paleontological time\nmicroevolution\nchanges in a population\u2019s genetic structure\nmodern synthesis\noverarching evolutionary paradigm that\ntook shape by the 1940s and scientists generally accept\ntoday\nnonrandom mating\nchanges in a population\u2019s gene pool\ndue to mate choice or other forces that cause individuals\nto mate with certain phenotypes more than others\npopulation genetics\nstudy of how selective forces change\nthe allele frequencies in a population over time\npopulation variation\ndistribution of phenotypes in a\npopulation\nrelative fitness\nindividual\u2019s ability to survive and reproduce\nrelative to the rest of the population\nselective pressure\nenvironmental factor that causes one\nphenotype to be better than another\nsexual dimorphism\nphenotypic difference between a\npopulation's males and females\nstabilizing selection\nselection that favors average\nphenotypes\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n19.1 Population Evolution\nThe modern synthesis of evolutionary theory grew out of the\ncohesion of Darwin\u2019s, Wallace\u2019s, and Mendel\u2019s thoughts on\nevolution and heredity, along with the more modern study of\npopulation genetics. It describes the evolution of\npopulations and species, from small-scale changes among\nindividuals to large-scale changes over paleontological time\nperiods. To understand how organisms evolve, scientists can\ntrack populations\u2019 allele frequencies over time. If they differ\nfrom generation to generation, scientists can conclude that\nthe population is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and is\nthus evolving.\n19.2 Population Genetics\nBoth genetic and environmental factors can cause\nphenotypic variation in a population. Different alleles can\nconfer different phenotypes, and different environments can\nalso cause individuals to look or act differently. Only those\ndifferences encoded in an individual\u2019s genes, however, can\npass to its offspring and, thus, be a target of natural\nselection. Natural selection works by selecting for alleles that\nconfer beneficial traits or behaviors, while selecting against\nthose for deleterious qualities. Genetic drift stems from the\nchance occurrence that some individuals in the gene line\nhave more offspring than others. When individuals leave or\njoin the population, allele frequencies can change as a result\nof gene flow. Mutations to an individual\u2019s DNA may\nintroduce new variation into a population. Allele frequencies\n482\nChapter 19 \u2022 Key Terms\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncan also alter when individuals do not randomly mate with\nothers in the group.\n19.3 Adaptive Evolution\nBecause natural selection acts to increase the frequency of\nbeneficial alleles and traits while decreasing the frequency of\ndeleterious qualities, it is adaptive evolution. Natural\nselection acts at the individual level, selecting for those that\nhave a higher overall fitness compared to the rest of the\npopulation. If the fit phenotypes are those that are similar,\nnatural selection will result in stabilizing selection, and an\noverall decrease in the population\u2019s variation. Directional\nselection works to shift a population\u2019s variance toward a new,\nfit phenotype, as environmental conditions change. In\ncontrast, diversifying selection results in increased genetic\nvariance by selecting for two or more distinct phenotypes.\nOther types of selection include frequency-dependent\nselection, in which individuals with either common (positive\nfrequency-dependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-\ndependent selection) are selected. Finally, sexual selection\nresults from one sex having more variance in the\nreproductive success than the other. As a result, males and\nfemales experience different selective pressures, which can\noften lead to the evolution of phenotypic differences, or\nsexual dimorphisms, between the two.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

By following pathways of similarities and changes\u2014both\nvisible and genetic\u2014scientists seek to map the evolutionary past of how life developed from single-celled\norganisms to the tremendous collection of creatures that have germinated, crawled, floated, swum,\nflown, and walked on this planet.\nChapter Outline\n20.1 Organizing Life on\nEarth\n20.2 Determining\nEvolutionary\nRelationships\n20.3 Perspectives on the\nPhylogenetic Tree\n20.1 Organizing Life on Earth\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the need for a comprehensive classification system\n\u2022\nList the different levels of the taxonomic classification system\n\u2022\nDescribe how systematics and taxonomy relate to phylogeny\n\u2022\nDiscuss a phylogenetic tree's components and purpose\nIn scientific terms, phylogeny is the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of\norganisms. A phylogeny describes the organisim's relationships, such as from which organisms it may have\nevolved, or to which species it is most closely related. Phylogenetic relationships provide information on\nshared ancestry but not necessarily on how organisms are similar or different.\nPhylogenetic Trees\nScientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among\norganisms. A phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or\ngroups of organisms. Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since\none cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships. In other words, we can construct a \u201ctree of life\u201d to\nillustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms\n(Figure 20.2).\nUnlike a taxonomic classification diagram, we can read a phylogenetic tree like a map of evolutionary\nhistory. Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor.\nScientists call such trees rooted, which means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the\nbottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate. Notice in the rooted phylogenetic\ntree that the three domains\u2014 Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya\u2014diverge from a single point and branch off.\nThe small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram shows how recent and\nminiscule these groups are compared with other organisms. Unrooted trees do not show a common ancestor\nbut do show relationships among species.\nFigure 20.2 Both of these phylogenetic trees show the relationship of the three domains of life\u2014Bacteria, Archaea,\nand Eukarya\u2014but the (a) rooted tree attempts to identify when various species diverged from a common ancestor\nwhile the (b) unrooted tree does not. (credit a: modification of work by Eric Gaba)\nIn a rooted tree, the branching indicates evolutionary relationships (Figure 20.3). The point where a split\noccurs, a branch point, represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one. We call a lineage\nthat evolved early from the root that remains unbranched a basal taxon. We call two lineages stemming\nfrom the same branch point sister taxa. A branch with more than two lineages is a polytomy and serves to\nillustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships. Note that although sister\ntaxa and polytomy do share an ancestor, it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from\neach other. Organisms in two taxa may have split at a specific branch point, but neither taxon gave rise to the\nother.\n486\nChapter 20 \u2022 Phylogenies and the History of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 20.3 A phylogenetic tree's root indicates that an ancestral lineage gave rise to all organisms on the tree. A branch point indicates\nwhere two lineages diverged. A lineage that evolved early and remains unbranched is a basal taxon. When two lineages stem from the same\nbranch point, they are sister taxa. A branch with more than two lineages is a polytomy.\nThe diagrams above can serve as a pathway to understanding evolutionary history. We can trace the pathway from the origin of\nlife to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points. Also, by starting with a\nsingle species and tracing back towards the \"trunk\" of the tree, one can discover species' ancestors, as well as where lineages\nshare a common ancestry. In addition, we can use the tree to study entire groups of organisms.\nAnother point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information. For\nexample, if a branch point rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because each taxon's\nevolution from the branch point was independent of the other.\nMany disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these\ndisciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the \u201ctree of life.\u201d Systematics is the field that scientists\nuse to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships. Researchers may use data from fossils, from\nstudying the body part structures, or molecules that an organism uses, and DNA analysis. By combining data from many\nsources, scientists can construct an organism's phylogeny Since phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, they will continue to change\nas researchers discover new types of life and learn new information.\nLimitations of Phylogenetic Trees\nIt may be easy to assume that more closely related organisms look more alike, and while this is often the case, it is not always\ntrue. If two closely related lineages evolved under significantly varied surroundings, it is possible for the two groups to appear\nmore different than other groups that are not as closely related. For example, the phylogenetic tree in Figure 20.4 shows that\nlizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs; whereas, frogs do not. Yet lizards and frogs appear more similar than lizards and\nrabbits.\nFigure 20.4 An organism that lacked a vertebral column roots this ladder-like phylogenetic tree of vertebrates. At each branch point,\nscientists place organisms with different characters in different groups based on shared characteristics.\n20.1 \u2022 Organizing Life on Earth\n487\nAnother aspect of phylogenetic trees is that, unless otherwise indicated, the branches do not account for length of time, only the\nevolutionary order. In other words, a branch's length does not typically mean more time passed, nor does a short branch mean\nless time passed\u2014 unless specified on the diagram. For example, in Figure 20.4, the tree does not indicate how much time\npassed between the evolution of amniotic eggs and hair. What the tree does show is the order in which things took place. Again\nusing Figure 20.4, the tree shows that the oldest trait is the vertebral column, followed by hinged jaws, and so forth. Remember\nthat any phylogenetic tree is a part of the greater whole, and like a real tree, it does not grow in only one direction after a new\nbranch develops. Thus, for the organisms in Figure 20.4, just because a vertebral column evolved does not mean that\ninvertebrate evolution ceased. It only means that a new branch formed. Also, groups that are not closely related, but evolve\nunder similar conditions, may appear more phenotypically similar to each other than to a close relative.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHead to this website (http://openstax.org/l/tree_of_life) to see interactive exercises that allow you to explore the evolutionary\nrelationships among species.\nClassification Levels\nTaxonomy (which literally means \u201carrangement law\u201d) is the science of classifying organisms to construct internationally shared\nclassification systems with each organism placed into increasingly more inclusive groupings. Think about a grocery store's\norganization. One large space is divided into departments, such as produce, dairy, and meats. Then each department further\ndivides into aisles, then each aisle into categories and brands, and then finally a single product. We call this organization from\nlarger to smaller, more specific categories a hierarchical system.\nThe taxonomic classification system (also called the Linnaean system after its inventor, Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist,\nzoologist, and physician) uses a hierarchical model. Moving from the point of origin, the groups become more specific, until one\nbranch ends as a single species. For example, after the common beginning of all life, scientists divide organisms into three large\ncategories called domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Within each domain is a second category called a kingdom. After\nkingdoms, the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are: phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species (Figure\n20.5).\nFigure 20.5 The taxonomic classification system uses a hierarchical model to organize living organisms into increasingly specific categories.\nThe common dog, Canis lupus familiaris, is a subspecies of Canis lupus, which also includes the wolf and dingo. (credit \u201cdog\u201d: modification\nof work by Janneke Vreugdenhil)\nThe kingdom Animalia stems from the Eukarya domain. Figure 20.5 above shows the classification for the common dog.\nTherefore, the full name of an organism technically has eight terms. For the dog it is: Eukarya, Animalia, Chordata, Mammalia,\nCarnivora, Canidae, Canis, and lupus. Notice that each name is capitalized except for species, and the genus and species names\nare italicized. Scientists generally refer to an organism only by its genus and species, which is its two-word scientific name, or\nbinomial nomenclature. Therefore, the scientific name of the dog is Canis lupus. The name at each level is also a taxon. In other\nwords, dogs are in order Carnivora. Carnivora is the name of the taxon at the order level; Canidae is the taxon at the family level,\nand so forth. Organisms also have a common name that people typically use, in this case, dog. Note that the dog is additionally a\nsubspecies: the \u201cfamiliaris\u201d in Canis lupus familiaris. Subspecies are members of the same species that are capable of mating\nand reproducing viable offspring, but they are separate subspecies due to geographic or behavioral isolation or other factors.\nFigure 20.6 shows how the levels move toward specificity with other organisms. Notice how the dog shares a domain with the\nwidest diversity of organisms, including plants and butterflies. At each sublevel, the organisms become more similar because\nthey are more closely related. Historically, scientists classified organisms using characteristics, but as DNA technology\n488\nChapter 20 \u2022 Phylogenies and the History of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ndeveloped, they have determined more precise phylogenies.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 20.6 At each sublevel in the taxonomic classification system, organisms become more similar. Dogs and wolves are the same\nspecies because they can breed and produce viable offspring, but they are different enough to be classified as different subspecies.

Recall that phylogenetic\ntrees are hypotheses and are modified as data becomes available. In addition, classification historically has focused on grouping\norganisms mainly by shared characteristics and does not necessarily illustrate how the various groups relate to each other from\nan evolutionary perspective. For example, despite the fact that a hippopotamus resembles a pig more than a whale, the\nhippopotamus may be the whale's closest living relative.\n20.2 Determining Evolutionary Relationships\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nCompare homologous and analogous traits\n\u2022\nDiscuss the purpose of cladistics\n\u2022\nDescribe maximum parsimony\nScientists must collect accurate information that allows them to make evolutionary connections among organisms. Similar to\ndetective work, scientists must use evidence to uncover the facts. In the case of phylogeny, evolutionary investigations focus on\ntwo types of evidence: morphologic (form and function) and genetic.\nTwo Options for Similarities\nIn general, organisms that share similar physical features and genomes are more closely related than those that do not. We refer\nto such features that overlap both morphologically (in form) and genetically as homologous structures. They stem from\ndevelopmental similarities that are based on evolution. For example, the bones in bat and bird wings have homologous\nstructures (Figure 20.7).\nFigure 20.7 Bat and bird wings are homologous structures, indicating that bats and birds share a common evolutionary past. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Steve Hillebrand, USFWS; credit b: modification of work by U.S. DOI BLM)\nNotice it is not simply a single bone, but rather a grouping of several bones arranged in a similar way. The more complex the\nfeature, the more likely any kind of overlap is due to a common evolutionary past. Imagine two people from different countries\nboth inventing a car with all the same parts and in exactly the same arrangement without any previous or shared knowledge.\nThat outcome would be highly improbable. However, if two people both invented a hammer, we can reasonably conclude that\nboth could have the original idea without the help of the other. The same relationship between complexity and shared\nevolutionary history is true for homologous structures in organisms.\nMisleading Appearances\nSome organisms may be very closely related, even though a minor genetic change caused a major morphological difference to\nmake them look quite different. Similarly, unrelated organisms may be distantly related, but appear very much alike. This\nusually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions.\nWhen similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship, it is\nan analogy or homoplasy. For example, insects use wings to fly like bats and birds, but the wing structure and embryonic origin\nis completely different. These are analogous structures (Figure 20.8).\n490\nChapter 20 \u2022 Phylogenies and the History of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nSimilar traits can be either homologous or analogous. Homologous structures share a similar embryonic origin. Analogous\norgans have a similar function. For example, the bones in a whale's front flipper are homologous to the bones in the human arm.\nThese structures are not analogous. A butterfly or bird's wings are analogous but not homologous. Some structures are both\nanalogous and homologous: bird and bat wings are both homologous and analogous. Scientists must determine which type of\nsimilarity a feature exhibits to decipher the organisms' phylogeny.\nFigure 20.8 The (c) wing of a honeybee is similar in shape to a (b) bird wing and (a) bat wing, and it serves the same function. However, the\nhoneybee wing is not composed of bones and has a distinctly different structure and embryonic origin. These wing types (insect versus bat\nand bird) illustrate an analogy\u2014similar structures that do not share an evolutionary history.

New computer programs not only confirm many earlier classified organisms, but also\nuncover previously made errors. As with physical characteristics, even the DNA sequence can be tricky to read in some cases. For\nsome situations, two very closely related organisms can appear unrelated if a mutation occurred that caused a shift in the\ngenetic code. Inserting or deleting a mutation would move each nucleotide base over one place, causing two similar codes to\nappear unrelated.\nSometimes two segments of DNA code in distantly related organisms randomly share a high percentage of bases in the same\nlocations, causing these organisms to appear closely related when they are not. For both of these situations, computer\ntechnologies help identify the actual relationships, and, ultimately, the coupled use of both morphologic and molecular\ninformation is more effective in determining phylogeny.\n20.2 \u2022 Determining Evolutionary Relationships\n491\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nWhy Does Phylogeny Matter?\nEvolutionary biologists could list many reasons why understanding phylogeny is important to everyday life in human society.\nFor botanists, phylogeny acts as a guide to discovering new plants that can be used to benefit people. Think of all the ways\nhumans use plants\u2014food, medicine, and clothing are a few examples. If a plant contains a compound that is effective in\ntreating cancer, scientists might want to examine all of the compounds for other useful drugs.\nA research team in China identified a DNA segment that they thought to be common to some medicinal plants in the family\nFabaceae (the legume family). They worked to identify which species had this segment (Figure 20.9). After testing plant species\nin this family, the team found a DNA marker (a known location on a chromosome that enabled them to identify the species)\npresent. Then, using the DNA to uncover phylogenetic relationships, the team could identify whether a newly discovered plant\nwas in this family and assess its potential medicinal properties.\nFigure 20.9 Dalbergia sissoo (D. sissoo) is in the Fabaceae, or legume family. Scientists found that D. sissoo shares a DNA marker with\nspecies within the Fabaceae family that have antifungal properties. Subsequently, researchers found that D. sissoo had fungicidal activity,\nsupporting the idea that DNA markers are useful to screen plants with potential medicinal properties.\n492\nChapter 20 \u2022 Phylogenies and the History of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nBuilding Phylogenetic Trees\nHow do scientists construct phylogenetic trees? After they sort the homologous and analogous traits, scientists often organize\nthe homologous traits using cladistics. This system sorts organisms into clades: groups of organisms that descended from a\nsingle ancestor. For example, in Figure 20.10, all the organisms in the orange region evolved from a single ancestor that had\namniotic eggs. Consequently, these organisms also have amniotic eggs and make a single clade, or a monophyletic group.\nClades must include all descendants from a branch point.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 20.10 Lizards, rabbits, and humans all descend from a common ancestor that had an amniotic egg. Thus, lizards, rabbits, and\nhumans all belong to the clade Amniota. Vertebrata is a larger clade that also includes fish and lamprey.\nWhich animals in this figure belong to a clade that includes animals with hair? Which evolved first, hair or the amniotic egg?\nClades can vary in size depending on which branch point one references. The important factor is that all organisms in the clade\nor monophyletic group stem from a single point on the tree. You can remember this because monophyletic breaks down into\n\u201cmono,\u201d meaning one, and \u201cphyletic,\u201d meaning evolutionary relationship. Figure 20.11 shows various clade examples. Notice how\neach clade comes from a single point; whereas, the non-clade groups show branches that do not share a single point.\n20.2 \u2022 Determining Evolutionary Relationships\n493\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 20.11 All the organisms within a clade stem from a single point on the tree. A clade may contain multiple groups, as in the case of\nanimals, fungi and plants, or a single group, as in the case of flagellates. Groups that diverge at a different branch point, or that do not\ninclude all groups in a single branch point, are not clades.\nWhat is the largest clade in this diagram?\nShared Characteristics\nOrganisms evolve from common ancestors and then diversify. Scientists use the phrase \u201cdescent with modification\u201d because\neven though related organisms have many of the same characteristics and genetic codes, changes occur. This pattern repeats as\none goes through the phylogenetic tree of life:\n1.\nA change in an organism's genetic makeup leads to a new trait which becomes prevalent in the group.\n2.\nMany organisms descend from this point and have this trait.\n3.\nNew variations continue to arise: some are adaptive and persist, leading to new traits.\n4.\nWith new traits, a new branch point is determined (go back to step 1 and repeat).\nIf a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group, it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the organisms\nin the taxon or clade have that trait. The vertebrate in Figure 20.10 is a shared ancestral character. Now consider the amniotic\negg characteristic in the same figure. Only some of the organisms in Figure 20.10 have this trait, and to those that do, it is called\na shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree.\nThe tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is that these terms are relative. We can consider the same\ntrait one or the other depending on the particular diagram that we use. Returning to Figure 20.10, note that the amniotic egg is\na shared ancestral character for the Amniota clade, while having hair is a shared derived character for some organisms in this\ngroup. These terms help scientists distinguish between clades in building phylogenetic trees.\nChoosing the Right Relationships\nImagine being the person responsible for organizing all department store items properly\u2014an overwhelming task. Organizing\nthe evolutionary relationships of all life on Earth proves much more difficult: scientists must span enormous blocks of time and\nwork with information from long-extinct organisms. Trying to decipher the proper connections, especially given the presence of\n494\nChapter 20 \u2022 Phylogenies and the History of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nhomologies and analogies, makes the task of building an accurate tree of life extraordinarily difficult. Add to that advancing\nDNA technology, which now provides large quantities of genetic sequences for researchers to use and analzye. Taxonomy is a\nsubjective discipline: many organisms have more than one connection to each other, so each taxonomist will decide the order of\nconnections.\nTo aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately, scientists often use the concept of maximum parsimony,\nwhich means that events occurred in the simplest, most obvious way. For example, if a group of people entered a forest preserve\nto hike, based on the principle of maximum parsimony, one could predict that most would hike on established trails rather than\nforge new ones.\nFor scientists deciphering evolutionary pathways, the same idea is used: the pathway of evolution probably includes the fewest\nmajor events that coincide with the evidence at hand. Starting with all of the homologous traits in a group of organisms,\nscientists look for the most obvious and simple order of evolutionary events that led to the occurrence of those traits.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHead to this website (http://openstax.org/l/using_parsimony) to learn how researchers use maximum parsimony to create\nphylogenetic trees.\nThese tools and concepts are only a few strategies scientists use to tackle the task of revealing the evolutionary history of life on\nEarth. Recently, newer technologies have uncovered surprising discoveries with unexpected relationships, such as the fact that\npeople seem to be more closely related to fungi than fungi are to plants. Sound unbelievable? As the information about DNA\nsequences grows, scientists will become closer to mapping the evolutionary history of all life on Earth.\n20.3 Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Tree\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe horizontal gene transfer\n\u2022\nIllustrate how prokaryotes and eukaryotes transfer genes horizontally\n\u2022\nIdentify the web and ring models of phylogenetic relationships and describe how they differ from the original\nphylogenetic tree concept\nPhylogenetic modeling concepts are constantly changing. It is one of the most dynamic fields of study in all biology. Over the\nlast several decades, new research has challenged scientists\u2019 ideas about how organisms are related. The scientific community\nhas proposed new models of these relationships.\nMany phylogenetic trees are models of the evolutionary relationship among species. Phylogenetic trees originated with Charles\nDarwin, who sketched the first phylogenetic tree in 1837 (Figure 20.12a). This served as a prototype for subsequent studies for\nmore than a century. The phylogenetic tree concept with a single trunk representing a common ancestor, with the branches\nrepresenting the divergence of species from this ancestor, fits well with the structure of many common trees, such as the oak\n(Figure 20.12b). However, evidence from modern DNA sequence analysis and newly developed computer algorithms has caused\nskepticism about the standard tree model's validity in the scientific community.\n20.3 \u2022 Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Tree\n495\nFigure 20.12 The (a) concept of the \u201ctree of life\u201d dates to an 1837 Charles Darwin sketch. Like an (b) oak tree, the \u201ctree of life\u201d has a single\ntrunk and many branches. (credit b: modification of work by \"Amada44\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nLimitations to the Classic Model\nClassical thinking about prokaryotic evolution, included in the classic tree model, is that species evolve clonally. That is, they\nproduce offspring themselves with only random mutations causing the descent into the variety of modern-day and extinct\nspecies known to science. This view is somewhat complicated in eukaryotes that reproduce sexually, but the laws of Mendelian\ngenetics explain the variation in offspring, again, to be a result of a mutation within the species. Scientists did not consider the\nconcept of genes transferring between unrelated species as a possibility until relatively recently. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT),\nor lateral gene transfer, is the transfer of genes between unrelated species. HGT is an ever-present phenomenon, with many\nevolutionists postulating a major role for this process in evolution, thus complicating the simple tree model. Genes pass\nbetween species which are only distantly related using standard phylogeny, thus adding a layer of complexity to understanding\nphylogenetic relationships.\nThe various ways that HGT occurs in prokaryotes is important to understanding phylogenies. Although at present some do not\nview HGT as important to eukaryotic evolution, HGT does occur in this domain as well. Finally, as an example of the ultimate\ngene transfer, some scientists have proposed genome fusion theories between symbiotic or endosymbiotic organisms to explain\nan event of great importance\u2014the evolution of the first eukaryotic cell, without which humans could not have come into\nexistence.\nHorizontal Gene Transfer\nHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the introduction of genetic material from one species to another species by mechanisms\nother than the vertical transmission from parent(s) to offspring. These transfers allow even distantly related species to share\ngenes, influencing their phenotypes. Scientists believe that HGT is more prevalent in prokaryotes, but that this process transfers\nonly about 2% of the prokaryotic genome. Some researchers believe such estimates are premature: we must view the actual\nimportance of HGT to evolutionary processes as a work in progress. As scientists investigate this phenomenon more thoroughly,\nthey may reveal more HGT transfer. Many scientists believe that HGT and mutation are (especially in prokaryotes) a significant\nsource of genetic variation, which is the raw material in the natural selection process. These transfers may occur between any\ntwo species that share an intimate relationship (Table 20.1).\nProkaryotic and Eukaryotic HGT Mechanisms Summary\nMechanism\nMode of Transmission\nExample\nProkaryotes\ntransformation\nDNA uptake\nmany prokaryotes\nTable 20.1\n496\nChapter 20 \u2022 Phylogenies and the History of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nMechanism\nMode of Transmission\nExample\ntransduction\nbacteriophage (virus)\nbacteria\nconjugation\npilus\nmany prokaryotes\ngene transfer agents\nphage-like particles\npurple non-sulfur bacteria\nEukaryotes\nfrom food organisms\nunknown\naphid\njumping genes\ntransposons\nrice and millet plants\nepiphytes/parasites\nunknown\nyew tree fungi\nfrom viral infections\nTable 20.1\nHGT in Prokaryotes\nHGT mechanisms are quite common in the Bacteria and Archaea domains, thus significantly changing the way scientists view\ntheir evolution. The majority of evolutionary models, such as in the Endosymbiont Theory, propose that eukaryotes descended\nfrom multiple prokaryotes, which makes HGT all the more important to understanding the phylogenetic relationships of all\nextant and extinct species. The Endosymbiont Theory purports that the eukaryotes' mitochondria and the green plants'\nchloroplasts and flagellates originated as free-living prokaryotes that invaded primitive eukaryotic cells and become established\nas permanent symbionts in the cytoplasm.\nMicrobiology students are well aware that genes transfer among common bacteria. These gene transfers between species are the\nmajor mechanism whereby bacteria acquire resistance to antibiotics. Classically, scientists believe that three different\nmechanisms drive such transfers.\n1.\nTransformation: bacteria takes up naked DNA\n2.\nTransduction: a virus transfers the genes\n3.\nConjugation: a hollow tube, or pilus transfers genes between organisms\nMore recently, scientists have discovered a fourth gene transfer mechanism between prokaryotes. Small, virus-like particles, or\ngene transfer agents (GTAs) transfer random genomic segments from one prokaryote species to another. GTAs are responsible\nfor genetic changes, sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other evolutionary processes. Scientists characterized the\nfirst GTA in 1974 using purple, non-sulfur bacteria. These GTAs, which are most likely derived from bacteriophage DNA inserted\nin a prokaryote that lost the ability to produce new bacteriophages, carry random DNA pieces from one organism to another.\nControlled studies using marine bacteria have demonstrated GTAs' ability to act with high frequency. Scientists have estimated\ngene transfer events in marine prokaryotes, either by GTAs or by viruses, to be as high as 1013 per year in the Mediterranean Sea\nalone. GTAs and viruses are efficient HGT vehicles with a major impact on prokaryotic evolution.\nAs a consequence of this modern DNA analysis, the idea that eukaryotes evolved directly from Archaea has fallen out of favor.\nWhile eukaryotes share many features that are absent in bacteria, such as the TATA box (located in many genes' promoter\nregion), the discovery that some eukaryotic genes were more homologous with bacterial DNA than Archaea DNA made this idea\nless tenable. Furthermore, scientists have proposed genome fusion from Archaea and Bacteria by endosymbiosis as the ultimate\nevent in eukaryotic evolution.\nHGT in Eukaryotes\nAlthough it is easy to see how prokaryotes exchange genetic material by HGT, scientists initially thought that this process was\nabsent in eukaryotes. After all, prokaryotes are but single cells exposed directly to their environment; whereas, the multicellular\norganisms' sex cells are usually sequestered in protected parts of the body. It follows from this idea that the gene transfers\nbetween multicellular eukaryotes should be more difficult. Scientists believe this process is rarer in eukaryotes and has a much\nsmaller evolutionary impact than in prokaryotes. In spite of this, HGT between distantly related organisms is evident in several\n20.3 \u2022 Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Tree\n497\neukaryotic species, and it is possible that scientists will discover more examples in the future.\nIn plants, researchers have observed gene transfer in species that cannot cross-pollinate by normal means. Transposons or\n\u201cjumping genes\u201d have shown a transfer between rice and millet plant species. Furthermore, fungal species feeding on yew trees,\nfrom which the anti-cancer drug TAXOL\u00ae is derived from the bark, have acquired the ability to make taxol themselves, a clear\nexample of gene transfer.\nIn animals, a particularly interesting example of HGT occurs within the aphid species (Figure 20.13). Aphids are insects that vary\nin color based on carotenoid content. Carotenoids are pigments that a variety of plants, fungi, and microbes produce, and they\nserve a variety of functions in animals, who obtain these chemicals from their food. Humans require carotenoids to synthesize\nvitamin A, and we obtain them by eating orange fruits and vegetables: carrots, apricots, mangoes, and sweet potatoes.\nAlternatively, aphids have acquired the ability to make the carotenoids on their own. According to DNA analysis, this ability is\ndue to fungal genes transferring into the insect by HGT, presumably as the insect consumed fungi for food. A carotenoid\nenzyme, or desaturase, is responsible for the red coloration in certain aphids, and when mutation of this gene leads to\nformation of inactive enzyme, the aphids revert to their more common green color (Figure 20.13).\nFigure 20.13 (a) Red aphids get their color from red carotenoid pigment. Genes necessary to make this pigment are present in certain fungi,\nand scientists speculate that aphids acquired these genes through HGT after consuming fungi for food. If mutation inactivates the genes for\nmaking carotenoids, the aphids revert back to (b) their green color. Red coloration makes the aphids considerably more conspicuous to\npredators, but evidence suggests that red aphids are more resistant to insecticides than green ones. Thus, red aphids may be more fit to\nsurvive in some environments than green ones. (credit a: modification of work by Benny Mazur; credit b: modification of work by Mick\nTalbot)\nGenome Fusion and Eukaryote Evolution\nScientists believe the ultimate in HGT occurs through genome fusion between different prokaryote species when two symbiotic\norganisms become endosymbiotic. This occurs when one species is taken inside another species' cytoplasm, which ultimately\nresults in a genome consisting of genes from both the endosymbiont and the host. This mechanism is an aspect of the\nEndosymbiont Theory, which most biologists accept as the mechanism whereby eukaryotic cells obtained their mitochondria\nand chloroplasts. However, the role of endosymbiosis in developing the nucleus is more controversial. Scientists believe that\nnuclear and mitochondrial DNA have different (separate) evolutionary origins, with the mitochondrial DNA derived from the\nbacteria's circular genomes ancient prokaryotic cells engulfed. We can regard mitochondrial DNA as the smallest chromosome.\nInterestingly enough, mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother. The mitochondrial DNA degrades in sperm when\nthe sperm degrades in the fertilized egg or in other instances when the mitochondria located in the sperm's flagellum fails to\nenter the egg.\nWithin the past decade, James Lake of the UCLA/NASA Astrobiology Institute proposed that the genome fusion process is\nresponsible for the evolution of the first eukaryotic cells (Figure 20.14a). Using DNA analysis and a new mathematical algorithm,\nconditioned reconstruction (CR), his laboratory proposed that eukaryotic cells developed from an endosymbiotic gene fusion\nbetween two species, one an Archaea and the other a Bacteria. As mentioned, some eukaryotic genes resemble those of Archaea;\nwhereas, others resemble those from Bacteria. An endosymbiotic fusion event, such as Lake has proposed, would clearly explain\nthis observation. Alternatively, this work is new and the CR algorithm is relatively unsubstantiated, which causes many\nscientists to resist this hypothesis.\nLake's more recent work (Figure 20.14b) proposes that gram-negative bacteria, which are unique within their domain in that\n498\nChapter 20 \u2022 Phylogenies and the History of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthey contain two lipid bilayer membranes, resulted from an endosymbiotic fusion of archaeal and bacterial species. The double\nmembrane would be a direct result of the endosymbiosis, with the endosymbiont picking up the second membrane from the\nhost as it was internalized. Scientists have also used this mechanism to explain the double membranes in mitochondria and\nchloroplasts. Lake\u2019s work is not without skepticism, and the biological science community still debates his ideas. In addition to\nLake\u2019s hypothesis, there are several other competing theories as to the origin of eukaryotes. How did the eukaryotic nucleus\nevolve? One theory is that the prokaryotic cells produced an additional membrane that surrounded the bacterial chromosome.\nSome bacteria have the DNA enclosed by two membranes; however, there is no evidence of a nucleolus or nuclear pores. Other\nproteobacteria also have membrane-bound chromosomes. If the eukaryotic nucleus evolved this way, we would expect one of\nthe two types of prokaryotes to be more closely related to eukaryotes.\nFigure 20.14 The scientific community now widely accepts the theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts are endosymbiotic in origin. More\ncontroversial is the proposal that (a) the eukaryotic nucleus resulted from fusing archaeal and bacterial genomes, and that (b) Gram-\nnegative bacteria, which have two membranes, resulted from fusing Archaea and Gram-positive bacteria, each of which has a single\nmembrane.\nThe nucleus-first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first (Figure 20.15a), followed by a later fusion of\nthe new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria. The mitochondria-first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria\nwere first established in a prokaryotic host (Figure 20.15b), which subsequently acquired a nucleus, by fusion or other\nmechanisms, to become the first eukaryotic cell. Most interestingly, the eukaryote-first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes\nactually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity (Figure 20.15c). All of these hypotheses are testable. Only time\nand more experimentation will determine which hypothesis data best supports.\n20.3 \u2022 Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Tree\n499\nFigure 20.15 Three alternate hypotheses of eukaryotic and prokaryotic evolution are (a) the nucleus-first hypothesis, (b) the\nmitochondrion-first hypothesis, and (c) the eukaryote-first hypothesis.\nWeb and Network Models\nRecognizing the importance of HGT, especially in prokaryote evolution, has caused some to propose abandoning the classic\n\u201ctree of life\u201d model. In 1999, W. Ford Doolittle proposed a phylogenetic model that resembles a web or a network more than a\ntree. The hypothesis is that eukaryotes evolved not from a single prokaryotic ancestor, but from a pool of many species that were\nsharing genes by HGT mechanisms. As Figure 20.16a shows, some individual prokaryotes were responsible for transferring the\nbacteria that caused mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes; whereas, other species transferred the bacteria that\ngave rise to chloroplasts. Scientists often call this model the \u201cweb of life.\u201d In an effort to save the tree analogy, some have\nproposed using the Ficus tree (Figure 20.16b) with its multiple trunks as a phylogenetic way to represent a diminished\nevolutionary role for HGT.\nFigure 20.16 In W. Ford Doolittle's (a) phylogenetic model, the \u201ctree of life\u201d arose from a community of ancestral cells, has multiple trunks,\n500\nChapter 20 \u2022 Phylogenies and the History of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nand has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has occurred. Visually, this concept is better represented by (b) the\nmulti-trunked Ficus than by an oak's single trunk similar to Darwin's tree in Figure 20.12. (credit b: modification of work by\n\"psyberartist\"/Flickr)\nRing of Life Models\nOthers have proposed abandoning any tree-like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure, the so-called \u201cring of life\u201d\n(Figure 20.17). This is a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes. Lake,\nagain using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm, proposes a ring-like model in which species of all three\ndomains\u2014Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya\u2014evolved from a single pool of gene-swapping prokaryotes. His laboratory proposes\nthat this structure is the best fit for data from extensive DNA analyses performed in his laboratory, and that the ring model is\nthe only one that adequately takes HGT and genomic fusion into account. However, other phylogeneticists remain highly\nskeptical of this model.\nFigure 20.17 According to the \u201cring of life\u201d phylogenetic model, the three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes.\nIn summary, we must modify Darwin's \u201ctree of life\u201d model to include HGT. Does this mean abandoning the tree model\ncompletely? Even Lake argues that scientists should attempt to modify the tree model to allow it to accurately fit his data, and\nonly the inability to do so will sway people toward his ring proposal.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean a tree, web, or a ring will correlate completely to an accurate description of phylogenetic relationships of life.\nA consequence of the new thinking about phylogenetic models is the idea that Darwin\u2019s original phylogenetic tree concept is too\nsimple, but made sense based on what scientists knew at the time. However, the search for a more useful model moves on: each\nmodel serves as hypotheses to test with the possibility of developing new models. This is how science advances. Researchers use\nthese models as visualizations to help construct hypothetical evolutionary relationships and understand the massive amount of\ndata that requires analysis.\n20.3 \u2022 Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Tree\n501\n", "key_terms": "\nanalogy\n(also, homoplasy) characteristic that is similar\nbetween organisms by convergent evolution, not due to\nthe same evolutionary path\nbasal taxon\nbranch on a phylogenetic tree that has not\ndiverged significantly from the root ancestor\nbinomial nomenclature\nsystem of two-part scientific\nnames for an organism, which includes genus and\nspecies names\nbranch point\nnode on a phylogenetic tree where a single\nlineage splits into distinct new ones\ncladistics\nsystem to organize homologous traits to describe\nphylogenies\nclass\ndivision of phylum in the taxonomic classification\nsystem\neukaryote-first hypothesis\nproposal that prokaryotes\nevolved from eukaryotes\nfamily\ndivision of order in the taxonomic classification\nsystem\ngene transfer agent (GTA)\nbacteriophage-like particle that\ntransfers random genomic segments from one species of\nprokaryote to another\ngenome fusion\nfusion of two prokaryotic genomes,\npresumably by endosymbiosis\ngenus\ndivision of family in the taxonomic classification\nsystem; the first part of the binomial scientific name\nhorizontal gene transfer (HGT)\n(also, lateral gene transfer)\ntransfer of genes between unrelated species\nkingdom\ndomain division in the taxonomic classification\nsystem\nmaximum parsimony\napplying the simplest, most obvious\nway with the least number of steps\nmitochondria-first hypothesis\nproposal that prokaryotes\nacquired a mitochondrion first, followed by nuclear\ndevelopment\nmolecular systematics\ntechnique using molecular evidence\nto identify phylogenetic relationships\nmonophyletic group\n(also, clade) organisms that share a\nsingle ancestor\nnucleus-first hypothesis\nproposal that prokaryotes\nacquired a nucleus first, and then the mitochondrion\norder\nclass division in the taxonomic classification system\nphylogenetic tree\ndiagram that reflects the evolutionary\nrelationships among organisms or groups of organisms\nphylogeny\nevolutionary history and relationship of an\norganism or group of organisms\nphylum\n(plural: phyla) kingdom division in the taxonomic\nclassification system\npolytomy\nbranch on a phylogenetic tree with more than\ntwo groups or taxa\nring of life\nphylogenetic model where all three domains of\nlife evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes\nrooted\nsingle ancestral lineage on a phylogenetic tree to\nwhich all organisms represented in the diagram relate\nshared ancestral character\ndescribes a characteristic on a\nphylogenetic tree that all organisms on the tree share\nshared derived character\ndescribes a characteristic on a\nphylogenetic tree that only a certain clade of organisms\nshare\nsister taxa\ntwo lineages that diverged from the same\nbranch point\nsystematics\nfield of organizing and classifying organisms\nbased on evolutionary relationships\ntaxon\n(plural: taxa) single level in the taxonomic\nclassification system\ntaxonomy\nscience of classifying organisms\nweb of life\nphylogenetic model that attempts to incorporate\nthe effects of horizontal gene transfer on evolution\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n20.1 Organizing Life on Earth\nScientists continually gain new information that helps\nunderstand the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Each\ngroup of organisms went through its own evolutionary\njourney, or its phylogeny. Each organism shares relatedness\nwith others, and based on morphologic and genetic\nevidence, scientists attempt to map the evolutionary\npathways of all life on Earth. Historically, scientists\norganized organisms into a taxonomic classification system.\nHowever, today many scientists build phylogenetic trees to\nillustrate evolutionary relationships.\n20.2 Determining Evolutionary\nRelationships\nTo build phylogenetic trees, scientists must collect accurate\ninformation that allows them to make evolutionary\nconnections between organisms. Using morphologic and\nmolecular data, scientists work to identify homologous\ncharacteristics and genes. Similarities between organisms\ncan stem either from shared evolutionary history\n(homologies) or from separate evolutionary paths\n(analogies). Scientists can use newer technologies to help\ndistinguish homologies from analogies.

They can infect organisms as diverse as bacteria, plants, and animals. In fact, viruses exist in a\nsort of netherworld between a living organism and a nonliving entity. Living things grow, metabolize,\nand reproduce. In contrast, viruses are not cellular, do not have a metabolism or grow, and cannot divide\nby cell division. Viruses can copy, or replicate themselves; however, they are entirely dependent on\nresources derived from their host cells to produce progeny viruses\u2014which are assembled in their mature\nform. No one knows exactly when or how viruses evolved or from what ancestral source because viruses\nhave not left a fossil record. Some virologists contend that modern viruses are a mosaic of bits and pieces\nof nucleic acids picked up from various sources along their respective evolutionary paths.\nChapter Outline\n21.1 Viral Evolution,\nMorphology, and\nClassification\n21.2 Virus Infections and\nHosts\n21.3 Prevention and\nTreatment of Viral\nInfections\n21.4 Other Acellular\nEntities: Prions and\nViroids\nViruses are diverse entities: They vary in structure, methods of replication, and the hosts they infect. Nearly\nall forms of life\u2014from prokaryotic bacteria and archaeans, to eukaryotes such as plants, animals, and\nfungi\u2014have viruses that infect them. While most biological diversity can be understood through\nevolutionary history (such as how species have adapted to changing environmental conditions and how\ndifferent species are related to one another through common descent), much about virus origins and\nevolution remains unknown.\nDiscovery and Detection\nViruses were first discovered after the development of a porcelain filter\u2014the Chamberland-Pasteur\nfilter\u2014that could remove all bacteria visible in the microscope from any liquid sample. In 1886, Adolph\nMeyer demonstrated that a disease of tobacco plants\u2014tobacco mosaic disease\u2014could be transferred from a\ndiseased plant to a healthy one via liquid plant extracts. In 1892, Dmitri Ivanowski showed that this disease\ncould be transmitted in this way even after the Chamberland-Pasteur filter had removed all viable bacteria\nfrom the extract. Still, it was many years before it was proved that these \u201cfilterable\u201d infectious agents were\nnot simply very small bacteria but were a new type of very small, disease-causing particle.\nMost virions, or single virus particles, are very small, about 20 to 250 nanometers in diameter. However,\nsome recently discovered viruses from amoebae range up to 1000 nm in diameter. With the exception of\nlarge virions, like the poxvirus and other large DNA viruses, viruses cannot be seen with a light microscope.\nIt was not until the development of the electron microscope in the late 1930s that scientists got their first\ngood view of the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (Figure 21.1), discussed above, and other\nviruses (Figure 21.2). The surface structure of virions can be observed by both scanning and transmission\nelectron microscopy, whereas the internal structures of the virus can only be observed in images from a\ntransmission electron microscope. The use of electron microscopy and other technologies has allowed for the\ndiscovery of many viruses of all types of living organisms.\nFigure 21.2 Most virus particles are visible only by electron microscopy. In these transmission electron micrographs,\n(a) a virus is as dwarfed by the bacterial cell it infects, as (b) these E. coli cells are dwarfed by cultured colon cells.\n(credit a: modification of work by U.S. Dept. of Energy, Office of Science, LBL, PBD; credit b: modification of work by\nJ.P. Nataro and S. Sears, unpub. data, CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nEvolution of Viruses\nAlthough biologists have a significant amount of knowledge about how present-day viruses mutate and\n506\nChapter 21 \u2022 Viruses\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nadapt, much less is known about how viruses originated in the first place. When exploring the evolutionary history of most\norganisms, scientists can look at fossil records and similar historic evidence. However, viruses do not fossilize, as far as we\nknow, so researchers must extrapolate from investigations of how today\u2019s viruses evolve and by using biochemical and genetic\ninformation to create speculative virus histories.\nMost scholars agree that viruses don\u2019t have a single common ancestor, nor is there a single reasonable hypothesis about virus\norigins. There are current evolutionary scenarios that may explain the origin of viruses. One such hypothesis, the \u201cdevolution\u201d or\nthe regressive hypothesis, suggests that viruses evolved from free-living cells, or from intracellular prokaryotic parasites.\nHowever, many components of how this process might have occurred remain a mystery. A second hypothesis, the escapist or the\nprogressive hypothesis, suggests that viruses originated from RNA and DNA molecules, or self-replicating entities similar to\ntransposons or other mobile genetic elements, that escaped from a host cell with the ability to enter another. A third hypothesis,\nthe virus first hypothesis, suggests that viruses may have been the first self-replicating entities before the first cells. In all cases,\nviruses are probably continuing to evolve along with the cells on which they rely on as hosts.\nAs technology advances, scientists may develop and refine additional hypotheses to explain the origins of viruses. The emerging\nfield called virus molecular systematics attempts to do just that through comparisons of sequenced genetic material. These\nresearchers hope one day to better understand the origin of viruses\u2014a discovery that could lead to advances in the treatments\nfor the ailments they produce.\nViral Morphology\nViruses are noncellular, meaning they are biological entities that do not have a cellular structure. They therefore lack most of the\ncomponents of cells, such as organelles, ribosomes, and the plasma membrane. A virion consists of a nucleic acid core, an outer\nprotein coating or capsid, and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the\nhost cell. Viruses may also contain additional proteins, such as enzymes, within the capsid or attached to the viral genome. The\nmost obvious difference between members of different viral families is the variation in their morphology, which is quite diverse.\nAn interesting feature of viral complexity is that the complexity of the host does not necessarily correlate with the complexity of\nthe virion. In fact, some of the most complex virion structures are found in the bacteriophages\u2014viruses that infect the simplest\nliving organisms, bacteria.\nMorphology\nViruses come in many shapes and sizes, but these features are consistent for each viral family. As we have seen, all virions have a\nnucleic acid genome covered by a protective capsid. The proteins of the capsid are encoded in the viral genome, and are called\ncapsomeres. Some viral capsids are simple helices or polyhedral \u201cspheres,\u201d whereas others are quite complex in structure\n(Figure 21.3).\n21.1 \u2022 Viral Evolution, Morphology, and Classification\n507\nFigure 21.3 Viral capsids can be (a) helical, (b) polyhedral, or (c) have a complex shape. (credit a \u201cmicrograph\u201d: modification of work by\nUSDA ARS; credit b \u201cmicrograph\u201d: modification of work by U.S. Department of Energy)\nIn general, the capsids of viruses are classified into four groups: helical, icosahedral, enveloped, and head-and-tail. Helical\ncapsids are long and cylindrical. Many plant viruses are helical, including TMV. Icosahedral viruses have shapes that are roughly\nspherical, such as those of poliovirus or herpesviruses. Enveloped viruses have membranes derived from the host cell that\nsurrounds the capsids. Animal viruses, such as HIV, are frequently enveloped. Head-and-tail viruses infect bacteria and have a\nhead that is similar to icosahedral viruses and a tail shaped like helical viruses.\nMany viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral receptors. For these\nviruses, attachment is required for later penetration of the cell membrane; only after penetration takes place can the virus\ncomplete its replication inside the cell. The receptors that viruses use are molecules that are normally found on cell surfaces and\nhave their own physiological functions. It appears that viruses have simply evolved to make use of these molecules for their own\nreplication. For example, HIV uses the CD4 molecule on T lymphocytes as one of its receptors (Figure 21.4). CD4 is a type of\nmolecule called a cell adhesion molecule, which functions to keep different types of immune cells in close proximity to each\nother during the generation of a T lymphocyte immune response.\n508\nChapter 21 \u2022 Viruses\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 21.4 A virus and its host receptor protein. The HIV virus binds the CD4 receptor on the surface of human cells. CD4 receptors help\nwhite blood cells to communicate with other cells of the immune system when producing an immune response. (credit: modification of\nwork by NIAID, NIH)\nOne of the most complex virions known, the T4 bacteriophage (which infects the Escherichia coli) bacterium, has a tail structure\nthat the virus uses to attach to host cells and a head structure that houses its DNA.\nAdenovirus, a non-enveloped animal virus that causes respiratory illnesses in humans, uses glycoprotein spikes protruding\nfrom its capsomeres to attach to host cells. Non-enveloped viruses also include those that cause polio (poliovirus), plantar warts\n(papillomavirus), and hepatitis A (hepatitis A virus).\nEnveloped virions, such as the influenza virus, consist of nucleic acid (RNA in the case of influenza) and capsid proteins\nsurrounded by a phospholipid bilayer envelope that contains virus-encoded proteins. Glycoproteins embedded in the viral\nenvelope are used to attach to host cells. Other envelope proteins are the matrix proteins that stabilize the envelope and often\nplay a role in the assembly of progeny virions. Chicken pox, HIV, and mumps are other examples of diseases caused by viruses\nwith envelopes. Because of the fragility of the envelope, non-enveloped viruses are more resistant to changes in temperature,\npH, and some disinfectants than enveloped viruses.\nOverall, the shape of the virion and the presence or absence of an envelope tell us little about what disease the virus may cause or\nwhat species it might infect, but they are still useful means to begin viral classification (Figure 21.5).\n21.1 \u2022 Viral Evolution, Morphology, and Classification\n509\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 21.5 Complex Viruses. Viruses can be either complex or relatively simple in shape. This figure shows three relatively complex\nvirions: the bacteriophage T4, with its DNA-containing head group and tail fibers that attach to host cells; adenovirus, which uses spikes\nfrom its capsid to bind to host cells; and the influenza virus, which uses glycoproteins embedded in its envelope to bind to host cells. The\ninfluenza virus also has matrix proteins, internal to the envelope, which help stabilize the virion\u2019s shape.

The virus core\ncontains the genome\u2014the total genetic content of the virus. Viral genomes tend to be small, containing only those genes that\nencode proteins which the virus cannot get from the host cell. This genetic material may be single- or double-stranded. It may\nalso be linear or circular. While most viruses contain a single nucleic acid, others have genomes divided into several segments.\nThe RNA genome of the influenza virus is segmented, which contributes to its variability and continuous evolution, and\nexplains why it is difficult to develop a vaccine against it.\nIn DNA viruses, the viral DNA directs the host cell\u2019s replication proteins to synthesize new copies of the viral genome and to\ntranscribe and translate that genome into viral proteins. Human diseases caused by DNA viruses include chickenpox, hepatitis\nB, and adenoviruses. Sexually transmitted DNA viruses include the herpes virus and the human papilloma virus (HPV), which\nhas been associated with cervical cancer and genital warts.\n510\nChapter 21 \u2022 Viruses\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nRNA viruses contain only RNA as their genetic material. To replicate their genomes in the host cell, the RNA viruses must\nencode their own enzymes that can replicate RNA into RNA or, in the retroviruses, into DNA. These RNA polymerase enzymes\nare more likely to make copying errors than DNA polymerases, and therefore often make mistakes during transcription. For this\nreason, mutations in RNA viruses occur more frequently than in DNA viruses. This causes them to change and adapt more\nrapidly to their host. Human diseases caused by RNA viruses include influenza, hepatitis C, measles, and rabies. The HIV virus,\nwhich is sexually transmitted, is an RNA retrovirus.\nThe Challenge of Virus Classification\nBecause most viruses probably evolved from different ancestors, the systematic methods that scientists have used to classify\nprokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are not very useful. If viruses represent \u201cremnants\u201d of different organisms, then even genomic\nor protein analysis is not useful. Why?, Because viruses have no common genomic sequence that they all share. For example, the\n16S rRNA sequence so useful for constructing prokaryote phylogenies is of no use for a creature with no ribosomes! Biologists\nhave used several classification systems in the past. Viruses were initially grouped by shared morphology. Later, groups of\nviruses were classified by the type of nucleic acid they contained, DNA or RNA, and whether their nucleic acid was single- or\ndouble-stranded. However, these earlier classification methods grouped viruses differently, because they were based on\ndifferent sets of characters of the virus. The most commonly used classification method today is called the Baltimore\nclassification scheme, and is based on how messenger RNA (mRNA) is generated in each particular type of virus.\nPast Systems of Classification\nViruses contain only a few elements by which they can be classified: the viral genome, the type of capsid, and the envelope\nstructure for the enveloped viruses. All of these elements have been used in the past for viral classification (Table 21.1 and Figure\n21.6). Viral genomes may vary in the type of genetic material (DNA or RNA) and its organization (single- or double-stranded,\nlinear or circular, and segmented or non-segmented). In some viruses, additional proteins needed for replication are associated\ndirectly with the genome or contained within the viral capsid.\nVirus Classification by Genome Structure\nGenome Structure\nExamples\nRNA\nDNA\nRabies virus, retroviruses\nHerpesviruses, smallpox virus\nSingle-stranded\nDouble-stranded\nRabies virus, retroviruses\nHerpesviruses, smallpox virus\nLinear\nCircular\nRabies virus, retroviruses, herpesviruses, smallpox\nvirus\nPapillomaviruses, many bacteriophages\nNon-segmented: genome consists of a single segment of genetic\nmaterial\nSegmented: genome is divided into multiple segments\nParainfluenza viruses\nInfluenza viruses\nTable 21.1\n21.1 \u2022 Viral Evolution, Morphology, and Classification\n511\nFigure 21.6 Viruses can be classified according to their core genetic material and capsid design. (a) Rabies virus has a single-stranded RNA\n(ssRNA) core and an enveloped helical capsid, whereas (b) variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, has a double-stranded DNA\n(dsDNA) core and a complex capsid. Rabies transmission occurs when saliva from an infected mammal enters a wound. The virus travels\nthrough neurons in the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system, where it impairs brain function, and then travels to other\ntissues. The virus can infect any mammal, and most die within weeks of infection. Smallpox is a human virus transmitted by inhalation of\nthe variola virus, localized in the skin, mouth, and throat, which causes a characteristic rash. Before its eradication in 1979, infection\nresulted in a 30 to 35 percent mortality rate.

Capsids are classified as naked\nicosahedral, enveloped icosahedral, enveloped helical, naked helical, and complex. The type of genetic material (DNA or RNA)\nand its structure (single- or double-stranded, linear or circular, and segmented or non-segmented) are used to classify the virus\ncore structures (Table 21.2).\nVirus Classification by Capsid Structure\nCapsid Classification\nExamples\nNaked icosahedral\nHepatitis A virus, polioviruses\nEnveloped icosahedral\nEpstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, rubella\nvirus, yellow fever virus, HIV-1\nEnveloped helical\nInfluenza viruses, mumps virus, measles virus, rabies\nvirus\nNaked helical\nTobacco mosaic virus\nTable 21.2\n512\nChapter 21 \u2022 Viruses\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nCapsid Classification\nExamples\nComplex with many proteins; some have combinations of\nicosahedral and helical capsid structures\nHerpesviruses, smallpox virus, hepatitis B virus, T4\nbacteriophage\nTable 21.2\nFigure 21.7 Transmission electron micrographs of various viruses show their capsid structures.

In addition to the differences in morphology and genetics mentioned above, the Baltimore\nclassification scheme groups viruses according to how the mRNA is produced during the replicative cycle of the virus.\nGroup I viruses contain double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as their genome. Their mRNA is produced by transcription in much the\nsame way as with cellular DNA, using the enzymes of the host cell.\nGroup II viruses have single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as their genome. They convert their single-stranded genomes into a dsDNA\nintermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur.\nGroup III viruses use dsRNA as their genome. The strands separate, and one of them is used as a template for the generation of\nmRNA using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus.\nGroup IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity, which means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as\nmRNA. Intermediates of dsRNA, called replicative intermediates, are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA.\nMultiple, full-length RNA strands of negative polarity (complementary to the positive-stranded genomic RNA) are formed from\nthese intermediates, which may then serve as templates for the production of RNA with positive polarity, including both full-\nlength genomic RNA and shorter viral mRNAs.\n21.1 \u2022 Viral Evolution, Morphology, and Classification\n513\nGroup V viruses contain ssRNA genomes with a negative polarity, meaning that their sequence is complementary to the mRNA.\nAs with Group IV viruses, dsRNA intermediates are used to make copies of the genome and produce mRNA. In this case, the\nnegative-stranded genome can be converted directly to mRNA. Additionally, full-length positive RNA strands are made to serve\nas templates for the production of the negative-stranded genome.\nGroup VI viruses have diploid (two copies) ssRNA genomes that must be converted, using the enzyme reverse transcriptase, to\ndsDNA; the dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome. Then, mRNA can be\nproduced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome.\nGroup VII viruses have partial dsDNA genomes and make ssRNA intermediates that act as mRNA, but are also converted back\ninto dsDNA genomes by reverse transcriptase, necessary for genome replication.\nThe characteristics of each group in the Baltimore classification are summarized in Table 21.3 with examples of each group.\nBaltimore Classification\nGroup\nCharacteristics\nMode of mRNA Production\nExample\nI\nDouble-stranded\nDNA\nmRNA is transcribed directly from the DNA template\nHerpes simplex\n(herpesvirus)\nII\nSingle-stranded\nDNA\nDNA is converted to double-stranded form before RNA is\ntranscribed\nCanine parvovirus\n(parvovirus)\nIII\nDouble-stranded\nRNA\nmRNA is transcribed from the RNA genome\nChildhood\ngastroenteritis\n(rotavirus)\nIV\nSingle stranded\nRNA (+)\nGenome functions as mRNA\nCommon cold\n(picornavirus)\nV\nSingle stranded\nRNA (-)\nmRNA is transcribed from the RNA genome\nRabies\n(rhabdovirus)\nVI\nSingle stranded\nRNA viruses with\nreverse\ntranscriptase\nReverse transcriptase makes DNA from the RNA genome; DNA is\nthen incorporated in the host genome; mRNA is transcribed from\nthe incorporated DNA\nHuman\nimmunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV)\nVII\nDouble stranded\nDNA viruses with\nreverse\ntranscriptase\nThe viral genome is double-stranded DNA, but viral DNA is\nreplicated through an RNA intermediate; the RNA may serve\ndirectly as mRNA or as a template to make mRNA\nHepatitis B virus\n(hepadnavirus)\nTable 21.3\n21.2 Virus Infections and Hosts\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nList the steps of replication and explain what occurs at each step\n\u2022\nDescribe the lytic and lysogenic cycles of virus replication\n\u2022\nExplain the transmission of plant and animal viruses\n\u2022\nDiscuss some of the diseases caused by plant and animal viruses\n\u2022\nDiscuss the economic impact of plant and animal viruses\n514\nChapter 21 \u2022 Viruses\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nViruses are obligate, intracellular parasites. A virus must first recognize and attach to a specific living cell prior to entering it.\nAfter penetration, the invading virus must copy its genome and manufacture its own proteins. Finally, the progeny virions must\nescape the host cell so that they can infect other cells. Viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within\nthat host. Specific host cells that a virus must occupy and use to replicate are called permissive. In most cases, the molecular\nbasis for this specificity is due to a particular surface molecule known as the viral receptor on the host cell surface. A specific\nviral receptor is required for the virus to attach. In addition, differences in metabolism and host-cell immune responses (based\non differential gene expression) are a likely factor in determining which cells a virus may target for replication.\nSteps of Virus Infections\nA virus must use its host-cell processes to replicate. The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural\nchanges in the host cell, which may cause cell damage. These changes, called cytopathic effects, can change cell functions or\neven destroy the cell. Some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, die through\nlysis (bursting) or apoptosis (programmed cell death or \u201ccell suicide\u201d), releasing all progeny virions at once. The symptoms of\nviral diseases result both from such cell damage caused by the virus and from the immune response to the virus, which attempts\nto control and eliminate the virus from the body.\nMany animal viruses, such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process\nknown as budding, where virions leave the cell individually. During the budding process, the cell does not undergo lysis and is\nnot immediately killed. However, the damage to the cells that the virus infects may make it impossible for the cells to function\nnormally, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time. Most productive viral infections follow similar steps in the\nvirus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release (Figure 21.8).\nAttachment\nA virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or via\nglycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope. The specificity of this interaction determines the host\u2014and the cells within the\nhost\u2014that can be infected by a particular virus. This can be illustrated by thinking of several keys and several locks, where each\nkey will fit only one specific lock.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis video (http://openstax.org/l/influenza) explains how influenza attacks the body.\nEntry\nViruses may enter a host cell either with or without the viral capsid. The nucleic acid of bacteriophages enters the host cell\n\u201cnaked,\u201d leaving the capsid outside the cell. Plant and animal viruses can enter through endocytosis (as you may recall, the cell\nmembrane surrounds and engulfs the entire virus). Some enveloped viruses enter the cell when the viral envelope fuses directly\nwith the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, the viral capsid degrades, and then the viral nucleic acid is released and becomes\navailable for replication and transcription.\nReplication and Assembly\nThe replication mechanism depends on the viral genome. DNA viruses usually use host-cell proteins and enzymes to replicate\nthe viral DNA and to transcribe viral mRNA, which is then used to direct viral protein synthesis. RNA viruses usually use the\nRNA core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNA. The viral mRNA directs the host cell to synthesize viral\nenzymes and capsid proteins, and assemble new virions.\nOf course, there are exceptions to this pattern. If a host cell does not provide the enzymes necessary for viral replication, viral\ngenes supply the information to direct synthesis of the missing proteins. Retroviruses, such as HIV (group VI of the Baltimore\nclassification scheme), have an RNA genome that must be reverse transcribed into DNA, which then is incorporated into the\nhost cell genome. To convert RNA into DNA, retroviruses must contain genes that encode the virus-specific enzyme reverse\ntranscriptase that transcribes an RNA template to DNA. Reverse transcription never occurs in uninfected host cells\u2014the\nenzyme reverse transcriptase is only derived from the expression of viral genes within the infected host cells. The fact that HIV\nproduces some of its own enzymes not found in the host has allowed researchers to develop drugs that inhibit these enzymes\nwithout affecting the host\u2019s metabolism.\nThis approach has led to the development of a variety of drugs used to treat HIV and has been effective at reducing the number\nof infectious virions (copies of viral RNA) in the blood to non-detectable levels in many HIV-infected individuals.\n21.2 \u2022 Virus Infections and Hosts\n515\nEgress\nThe last stage of viral replication is the release of the new virions produced in the host organism, where they are able to infect\nadjacent cells and repeat the replication cycle. As you\u2019ve learned, some viruses are released when the host cell dies, and other\nviruses can leave infected cells by budding through the membrane without directly killing the cell.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 21.8 The influenza reproductive cycle. In influenza virus infection, glycoproteins on the capsid attach to a host epithelial cell.\nFollowing this, the virus is engulfed. RNA and proteins are then made and assembled into new virions.\nInfluenza virus is packaged in a viral envelope that fuses with the plasma membrane. This way, the virus can exit the host cell\nwithout killing it. What advantage does the virus gain by keeping the host cell alive?\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch a video (https://openstax.org/l/viruses) on viruses, identifying structures, modes of transmission, replication, and more.\nDifferent Hosts and Their Viruses\nAs you\u2019ve learned, viruses often infect very specific hosts, as well as specific cells within the host. This feature of a virus makes it\nspecific to one or a few species of life on Earth. On the other hand, so many different types of viruses exist on Earth that nearly\nevery living organism has its own set of viruses trying to infect its cells. Even prokaryotes, the smallest and simplest of cells, may\nbe attacked by specific types of viruses. In the following section, we will look at some of the features of viral infection of\nprokaryotic cells. As we have learned, viruses that infect bacteria are called bacteriophages (Figure 21.9). Archaea have their own\nsimilar viruses.\n516\nChapter 21 \u2022 Viruses\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nBacteriophages\nFigure 21.9 Bacteriophages attached to a host cell (transmission electron micrograph). In bacteriophage with tails, like the one shown\nhere, the tails serve as a passageway for transmission of the phage genome. (credit: modification of work by Dr. Graham Beards; scale-bar\ndata from Matt Russell)\nMost bacteriophages are dsDNA viruses, which use host enzymes for DNA replication and RNA transcription. Phage particles\nmust bind to specific surface receptors and actively insert the genome into the host cell. (The complex tail structures seen in\nmany bacteriophages are actively involved in getting the viral genome across the prokaryotic cell wall.) When infection of a cell\nby a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions, the infection is said to be productive. If the virions are released by\nbursting the cell, the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle (Figure 21.10). An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4, which\ninfects Escherichia coli found in the human intestinal tract. Sometimes, however, a virus can remain within the cell without\nbeing released. For example, when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell, it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle\n(Figure 21.10), and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell. When the phage DNA is incorporated into\nthe host-cell genome, it is called a prophage. An example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the \u03bb (lambda) virus, which also infects\nthe E. coli bacterium. Viruses that infect plant or animal cells may sometimes undergo infections where they are not producing\nvirions for long periods. An example is the animal herpesviruses, including herpes simplex viruses, the cause of oral and genital\nherpes in humans. In a process called latency, these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without\nproducing new virions, only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates. Even though\nthere are similarities between lysogeny and latency, the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages.\nLatency will be described in more detail in the next section.\n21.2 \u2022 Virus Infections and Hosts\n517\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 21.10 A temperate bacteriophage has both lytic and lysogenic cycles. In the lytic cycle, the phage replicates and lyses the host cell.\nIn the lysogenic cycle, phage DNA is incorporated into the host genome, where it is passed on to subsequent generations. Environmental\nstressors such as starvation or exposure to toxic chemicals may cause the prophage to excise and enter the lytic cycle.\nWhich of the following statements is false?\na.\nIn the lytic cycle, new phages are produced and released into the environment.\nb.\nIn the lysogenic cycle, phage DNA is incorporated into the host genome.\nc.\nAn environmental stressor can cause the phage to initiate the lysogenic cycle.\nd.\nCell lysis only occurs in the lytic cycle.\nPlant Viruses\nMost plant viruses, like the tobacco mosaic virus, have single-stranded (+) RNA genomes. However, there are also plant viruses\nin most other virus categories. Unlike bacteriophages, plant viruses do not have active mechanisms for delivering the viral\ngenome across the protective cell wall. For a plant virus to enter a new host plant, some type of mechanical damage must occur.\nThis damage is often caused by weather, insects, animals, fire, or human activities like farming or landscaping. Movement from\ncell to cell within a plant can be facilitated by viral modification of plasmodesmata (cytoplasmic threads that pass from one plant\ncell to the next). Additionally, plant offspring may inherit viral diseases from parent plants. Plant viruses can be transmitted by a\nvariety of vectors, through contact with an infected plant\u2019s sap, by living organisms such as insects and nematodes, and through\npollen. The transfer of a virus from one plant to another is known as horizontal transmission, whereas the inheritance of a virus\nfrom a parent is called vertical transmission.\nSymptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host (Table 21.4). One common symptom is hyperplasia, the\nabnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls. Other viruses induce hypoplasia, or\ndecreased cell growth, in the leaves of plants, causing thin, yellow areas to appear. Still other viruses affect the plant by directly\nkilling plant cells, a process known as cell necrosis. Other symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves; black streaks on\nthe stems of the plants; altered growth of stems, leaves, or fruits; and ring spots, which are circular or linear areas of\ndiscoloration found in a leaf.\n518\nChapter 21 \u2022 Viruses\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nSome Common Symptoms of Plant Viral Diseases\nSymptom\nAppears as\nHyperplasia\nGalls (tumors)\nHypoplasia\nThinned, yellow splotches on leaves\nCell necrosis\nDead, blackened stems, leaves, or fruit\nAbnormal growth patterns\nMalformed stems, leaves, or fruit\nDiscoloration\nYellow, red, or black lines, or rings in stems, leaves, or fruit\nTable 21.4\nPlant viruses can seriously disrupt crop growth and development, significantly affecting our food supply. They are responsible\nfor poor crop quality and quantity globally, and can bring about huge economic losses annually. Others viruses may damage\nplants used in landscaping. Some viruses that infect agricultural food plants include the name of the plant they infect, such as\ntomato spotted wilt virus, bean common mosaic virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. In plants used for landscaping, two of the\nmost common viruses are peony ring spot and rose mosaic virus. There are far too many plant viruses to discuss each in detail,\nbut symptoms of bean common mosaic virus result in lowered bean production and stunted, unproductive plants. In the\nornamental rose, the rose mosaic disease causes wavy yellow lines and colored splotches on the leaves of the plant.\nAnimal Viruses\nAnimal viruses, unlike the viruses of plants and bacteria, do not have to penetrate a cell wall to gain access to the host cell. The\nvirus may even induce the host cell to cooperate in the infection process. Non-enveloped or \u201cnaked\u201d animal viruses may enter\ncells in two different ways. As a protein in the viral capsid binds to its receptor on the host cell, the virus may be taken inside the\ncell via a vesicle during the normal cell process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. An alternative method of cell penetration used\nby non-enveloped viruses is for capsid proteins to undergo shape changes after binding to the receptor, creating channels in the\nhost cell membrane. The viral genome is then \u201cinjected\u201d into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that\nused by many bacteriophages.\nEnveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors: receptor-mediated endocytosis, or\nfusion. Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to that seen in some non-\nenveloped viruses. On the other hand, fusion only occurs with enveloped virions. These viruses, which include HIV among\nothers, use special fusion proteins in their envelopes to cause the envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, thus\nreleasing the genome and capsid of the virus into the cell cytoplasm.\nAfter making their proteins and copying their genomes, animal viruses complete the assembly of new virions and exit the cell.\nAs we have already discussed using the example the influenza virus, enveloped animal viruses may bud from the cell membrane\nas they assemble themselves, taking a piece of the cell\u2019s plasma membrane in the process. On the other hand, non-enveloped\nviral progeny, such as rhinoviruses, accumulate in infected cells until there is a signal for lysis or apoptosis, and all virions are\nreleased together.\nAs you will learn in the next module, animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases. Some of them follow the\nclassic pattern of acute disease, where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination of the\nvirus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection. Examples of acute viral diseases are the\ncommon cold and influenza. Other viruses cause long-term chronic infections, such as the virus causing hepatitis C, whereas\nothers, like herpes simplex virus, only cause intermittent symptoms. Still other viruses, such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7,\nwhich in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola, often successfully cause productive infections without\ncausing any symptoms at all in the host, and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection.\nIn hepatitis C infections, the virus grows and reproduces in liver cells, causing low levels of liver damage. The damage is so low\n21.2 \u2022 Virus Infections and Hosts\n519\nthat infected individuals are often unaware that they are infected, and many infections are detected only by routine blood work\non patients with risk factors such as intravenous drug use. On the other hand, since many of the symptoms of viral diseases are\ncaused by immune responses, a lack of symptoms is an indication of a weak immune response to the virus. This allows the virus\nto escape elimination by the immune system and persist in individuals for years, all the while producing low levels of progeny\nvirions in what is known as a chronic viral disease. Chronic infection of the liver by this virus leads to a much greater chance of\ndeveloping liver cancer, sometimes as much as 30 years after the initial infection.\nAs already discussed, herpes simplex virus can remain in a state of latency in nervous tissue for months, even years. As the virus\n\u201chides\u201d in the tissue and makes few if any viral proteins, there is nothing for the immune response to act against, and immunity\nto the virus slowly declines. Under certain conditions, including various types of physical and psychological stress, the latent\nherpes simplex virus may be reactivated and undergo a lytic replication cycle in the skin, causing the lesions associated with the\ndisease. Once virions are produced in the skin and viral proteins are synthesized, the immune response is again stimulated and\nresolves the skin lesions in a few days or weeks by destroying viruses in the skin. As a result of this type of replicative cycle,\nappearances of cold sores and genital herpes outbreaks only occur intermittently, even though the viruses remain in the nervous\ntissue for life. Latent infections are common with other herpesviruses as well, including the varicella-zoster virus that causes\nchickenpox. After having a chickenpox infection in childhood, the varicella-zoster virus can remain latent for many years and\nreactivate in adults to cause the painful condition known as \u201cshingles\u201d (Figure 21.11).\nFigure 21.11 A latent virus infection. (a) Varicella-zoster, the virus that causes chickenpox, has an enveloped icosahedral capsid visible in\nthis transmission electron micrograph.

Martin, CDC; credit b:\nmodification of work by \u201crosmary\u201d/Flickr; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nSome animal-infecting viruses, including the hepatitis C virus discussed above, are known as oncogenic viruses: They have the\nability to cause cancer. These viruses interfere with the normal regulation of the host cell cycle either by introducing genes that\nstimulate unregulated cell growth (oncogenes) or by interfering with the expression of genes that inhibit cell growth. Oncogenic\nviruses can be either DNA or RNA viruses. Cancers known to be associated with viral infections include cervical cancer, caused\nby human papillomavirus (HPV) (Figure 21.12), liver cancer caused by hepatitis B virus, T-cell leukemia, and several types of\nlymphoma.\n520\nChapter 21 \u2022 Viruses\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 21.12 HPV, or human papillomavirus, has a naked icosahedral capsid visible in this transmission electron micrograph and a double-\nstranded DNA genome that is incorporated into the host DNA.

These diseases can be treated by antiviral drugs or by vaccines; however, some viruses, such as\nHIV, are capable both of avoiding the immune response and of mutating within the host organism to become resistant to\nantiviral drugs.\n21.3 \u2022 Prevention and Treatment of Viral Infections\n521\nFigure 21.13 A sampling of human viruses. Viruses can cause dozens of ailments in humans, ranging from mild illnesses to serious\ndiseases. (credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nVaccines for Prevention\nThe primary method of controlling viral disease is by vaccination, which is intended to prevent outbreaks by building immunity\nto a virus or virus family (Figure 21.14). Vaccines may be prepared using live viruses, killed viruses, or molecular subunits of the\nvirus. Note that the killed viral vaccines and subunit viruses are both incapable of causing disease, nor is there any valid\nevidence that vaccinations contribute to autism.\nLive viral vaccines are designed in the laboratory to cause few symptoms in recipients while giving them protective immunity\nagainst future infections. Polio was one disease that represented a milestone in the use of vaccines. Mass immunization\ncampaigns in the 1950s (killed vaccine) and 1960s (live vaccine) significantly reduced the incidence of the disease, which caused\nmuscle paralysis in children and generated a great amount of fear in the general population when regional epidemics occurred.\nThe success of the polio vaccine paved the way for the routine dispensation of childhood vaccines against measles, mumps,\nrubella, chickenpox, and other diseases.\nThe issue with using live vaccines (which are usually more effective than killed vaccines), is the low but significant danger that\nthese viruses will revert to their disease-causing form by back mutations. Live vaccines are usually made by attenuating\n(weakening) the \u201cwild-type\u201d (disease-causing) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from\nwhat the virus is accustomed to in the host. Adaptations to these new cells or temperatures induce mutations in the genomes of\nthe virus, allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause disease when reintroduced into\nconditions found in the host. These attenuated viruses thus still cause infection, but they do not grow very well, allowing the\nimmune response to develop in time to prevent major disease. Back mutations occur when the vaccine undergoes mutations in\nthe host such that it readapts to the host and can again cause disease, which can then be spread to other humans in an epidemic.\nThis type of scenario happened as recently as 2007 in Nigeria where mutations in a polio vaccine led to an epidemic of polio in\nthat country.\nSome vaccines are in continuous development because certain viruses, such as influenza and HIV, have a high mutation rate\ncompared to that of other viruses and normal host cells. With influenza, mutations in the surface molecules of the virus help the\norganism evade the protective immunity that may have been obtained in a previous influenza season, making it necessary for\n522\nChapter 21 \u2022 Viruses\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nindividuals to get vaccinated every year. Other viruses, such as those that cause the childhood diseases measles, mumps, and\nrubella, mutate so infrequently that the same vaccine is used year after year.\nFigure 21.14 Vaccinations are designed to boost immunity to a virus to prevent infection. (credit: USACE Europe District)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this NOVA video (http://openstax.org/l/1918_flu) to learn how microbiologists are attempting to replicate the deadly 1918\nSpanish influenza virus so they can understand more about virology.\nVaccines and Antiviral Drugs for Treatment\nIn some cases, vaccines can be used to treat an active viral infection. The concept behind this is that by giving the vaccine,\nimmunity is boosted without adding more disease-causing virus. In the case of rabies, a fatal neurological disease transmitted\nvia the saliva of rabies virus-infected animals, the progression of the disease from the time of the animal bite to the time it\nenters the central nervous system may be two weeks or longer. This is enough time to vaccinate individuals who suspect that\nthey have been bitten by a rabid animal, and their boosted immune response is sufficient to prevent the virus from entering\nnervous tissue. Thus, the potentially fatal neurological consequences of the disease are averted, and the individual only has to\nrecover from the infected bite. This approach is also being used for the treatment of Ebola, one of the fastest and most deadly\nviruses on Earth. Transmitted by bats and great apes, this disease can cause death in 70 to 90 percent of infected humans within\ntwo weeks. Using newly developed vaccines that boost the immune response in this way, there is hope that affected individuals\nwill be better able to control the virus, potentially saving a greater percentage of infected persons from a rapid and very painful\ndeath.\nAnother way of treating viral infections is the use of antiviral drugs. Because viruses use the resources of the host cell for\nreplication and the production of new virus proteins, it is difficult to block their activities without damaging the host. However,\nwe do have some effective antiviral drugs, such as those used to treat HIV and influenza. Some antiviral drugs are specific for a\nparticular virus and others have been used to control and reduce symptoms for a wide variety of viral diseases. For most viruses,\nthese drugs can inhibit the virus by blocking the actions of one or more of its proteins. It is important to note that the targeted\nproteins be encoded by viral genes and that these molecules are not present in a healthy host cell. In this way, viral growth is\ninhibited without damaging the host.\nAntivirals have been developed to treat genital herpes (herpes simplex II) and influenza. For genital herpes, drugs such as\nacyclovir can reduce the number and duration of episodes of active viral disease, during which patients develop viral lesions in\ntheir skin cells. As the virus remains latent in nervous tissue of the body for life, this drug is not curative but can make the\nsymptoms of the disease more manageable. For influenza, drugs like Tamiflu (oseltamivir) (Figure 21.15) can reduce the duration\nof \u201cflu\u201d symptoms by one or two days, but the drug does not prevent symptoms entirely. Tamiflu works by inhibiting an enzyme\n(viral neuraminidase) that allows new virions to leave their infected cells. Thus, Tamiflu inhibits the spread of virus from\n21.3 \u2022 Prevention and Treatment of Viral Infections\n523\ninfected to uninfected cells. Other antiviral drugs, such as Ribavirin, have been used to treat a variety of viral infections,\nalthough its mechanism of action against certain viruses remains unclear.\nFigure 21.15 Action of an antiviral drug. (a) Tamiflu inhibits a viral enzyme called neuraminidase (NA) found in the influenza viral envelope.\n(b) Neuraminidase cleaves the connection between viral hemagglutinin (HA), also found in the viral envelope, and glycoproteins on the host\ncell surface. Inhibition of neuraminidase prevents the virus from detaching from the host cell, thereby blocking further infection. (credit a:\nmodification of work by M. Eickmann)\nBy far, the most successful use of antivirals has been in the treatment of the retrovirus HIV, which causes a disease that, if\nuntreated, is usually fatal within 10 to 12 years after infection. Anti-HIV drugs have been able to control viral replication to the\npoint that individuals receiving these drugs survive for a significantly longer time than the untreated.\nAnti-HIV drugs inhibit viral replication at many different phases of the HIV replicative cycle (Figure 21.16). Drugs have been\ndeveloped that inhibit the fusion of the HIV viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the host cell (fusion inhibitors), the\nconversion of its RNA genome into double-stranded DNA (reverse transcriptase inhibitors, like AZT), the integration of the viral\nDNA into the host genome (integrase inhibitors), and the processing of viral proteins (protease inhibitors).\n524\nChapter 21 \u2022 Viruses\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 21.16 Life cycle of HIV. HIV, an enveloped, icosahedral virus, attaches to the CD4 receptor of an immune cell and fuses with the cell\nmembrane. Viral contents are released into the cell, where viral enzymes convert the single-stranded RNA genome into DNA and\nincorporate it into the host genome. (credit: NIAID, NIH)\nUnfortunately, when any of these drugs are used individually, the high mutation rate of the virus allows it to easily and rapidly\ndevelop resistance to the drug, limiting the drug\u2019s effectiveness. The breakthrough in the treatment of HIV was the development\nof HAART, highly active anti-retroviral therapy, which involves a mixture of different drugs, sometimes called a drug \u201ccocktail.\u201d\nBy attacking the virus at different stages of its replicative cycle, it is much more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to\nmultiple drugs at the same time. Still, even with the use of combination HAART therapy, there is concern that, over time, the\nvirus will develop resistance to this therapy. Thus, new anti-HIV drugs are constantly being developed with the hope of\ncontinuing the battle against this highly fatal virus.\n21.3 \u2022 Prevention and Treatment of Viral Infections\n525\n21.4 Other Acellular Entities: Prions and Viroids\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe prions and their basic properties\n\u2022\nDefine viroids and their targets of infection\nPrions and viroids are pathogens (agents with the ability to cause disease) that have simpler structures than viruses but, in the\ncase of prions, still can produce deadly diseases.\nPrions\nPrions, so-called because they are proteinaceous, are infectious particles\u2014smaller than viruses\u2014that contain no nucleic acids\n(neither DNA nor RNA). Historically, the idea of an infectious agent that did not use nucleic acids was considered impossible,\nbut pioneering work by Nobel Prize-winning biologist Stanley Prusiner has convinced the majority of biologists that such agents\ndo indeed exist.\nFatal neurodegenerative diseases, such as kuru in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle (commonly\nknown as \u201cmad cow disease\u201d) were shown to be transmitted by prions. The disease was spread by the consumption of meat,\nnervous tissue, or internal organs between members of the same species. Kuru, native to humans in Papua New Guinea, was\nspread from human to human via ritualistic cannibalism. BSE, originally detected in the United Kingdom, was spread between\ncattle by the practice of including cattle nervous tissue in feed for other cattle. Individuals with kuru and BSE show symptoms of\nEveryday Connection\nApplied Virology:\nThe study of viruses has led to the development of a variety of new ways to treat non-viral diseases. Viruses have been used\nin gene therapy. Gene therapy is used to treat genetic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a\nheritable, recessive disease in which children are born with severely compromised immune systems. One common type of\nSCID is due to the lack of an enzyme, adenosine deaminase (ADA), which breaks down purine bases. To treat this disease by\ngene therapy, bone marrow cells are taken from a SCID patient and the ADA gene is inserted. This is where viruses come in,\nand their use relies on their ability to penetrate living cells and bring genes in with them. Viruses such as adenovirus, an\nupper-respiratory human virus, are modified by the addition of the ADA gene, and the virus then transports this gene into\nthe cell. The modified cells, now capable of making ADA, are then given back to the patients in the hope of curing them.\nGene therapy using viruses as carriers of genes (viral vectors), although still experimental, holds promise for the treatment\nof many genetic diseases. Still, many technological problems need to be solved for this approach to be a viable method for\ntreating genetic disease.\nAnother medical use for viruses relies on their specificity and ability to kill the cells they infect. Oncolytic viruses are\nengineered in the laboratory specifically to attack and kill cancer cells. A genetically modified adenovirus known as H101 has\nbeen used since 2005 in clinical trials in China to treat head and neck cancers. The results have been promising, with a\ngreater short-term response rate to the combination of chemotherapy and viral therapy than to chemotherapy treatment\nalone. This ongoing research may herald the beginning of a new age of cancer therapy, where viruses are engineered to find\nand specifically kill cancer cells, regardless of where in the body they may have spread.\nA third use of viruses in medicine relies on their specificity and involves using bacteriophages in the treatment of bacterial\ninfections. Bacterial diseases have been treated with antibiotics since the 1940s. However, over time, many bacteria have\nevolved resistance to antibiotics. A good example is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, pronounced\n\u201cmersa\u201d), an infection commonly acquired in hospitals. This bacterium is resistant to a variety of antibiotics, making it\ndifficult to treat. The use of bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and\nspecifically kill them. Although phage therapy is in use in the Republic of Georgia to treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, its\nuse to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries. However, the safety of the treatment was confirmed\nin the United States when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy\nthe food pathogen Listeria. As more and more antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria evolve, the use of bacteriophages\nmight be a potential solution to the problem, and the development of phage therapy is of much interest to researchers\nworldwide.\n526\nChapter 21 \u2022 Viruses\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nloss of motor control and unusual behaviors, such as uncontrolled bursts of laughter with kuru, followed by death. Kuru was\ncontrolled by inducing the population to abandon its ritualistic cannibalism.\nOn the other hand, BSE was initially thought to only affect cattle. Cattle dying of the disease were shown to have developed\nlesions or \u201choles\u201d in the brain, causing the brain tissue to resemble a sponge. Later on in the outbreak, however, it was shown\nthat a similar encephalopathy in humans, known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), could be acquired from eating beef\nfrom animals infected with BSE, sparking bans by various countries on the importation of British beef and causing considerable\neconomic damage to the British beef industry (Figure 21.17). BSE still exists in various areas, and although a rare disease,\nindividuals that acquire CJD are difficult to treat. The disease can be spread from human to human by blood, so many countries\nhave banned blood donation from regions associated with BSE.\nThe cause of spongiform encephalopathies, such as kuru and BSE, is an infectious structural variant of a normal cellular protein\ncalled PrP (prion protein). It is this variant that constitutes the prion particle. PrP exists in two forms, PrPc, the normal form of\nthe protein, and PrPsc, the infectious form. Once introduced into the body, the PrPsccontained within the prion binds to PrPc\nand converts it to PrPsc. This leads to an exponential increase of the PrPsc protein, which aggregates. PrPscis folded abnormally,\nand the resulting conformation (shape) is directly responsible for the lesions seen in the brains of infected cattle. Thus, although\nnot without some detractors among scientists, the prion seems likely to be an entirely new form of infectious agent, the first one\nfound whose transmission is not reliant upon genes made of DNA or RNA.\nFigure 21.17 Mad Cow Disease in humans. (a) Endogenous normal prion protein (PrPc) is converted into the disease-causing form (PrPsc)\nwhen it encounters this variant form of the protein. PrPsc may arise spontaneously in brain tissue, especially if a mutant form of the protein\nis present, or it may occur via the spread of misfolded prions consumed in food into brain tissue. (b) This prion-infected brain tissue,\nvisualized using light microscopy, shows the vacuoles that give it a spongy texture, typical of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.\n(credit b: modification of work by Dr. Al Jenny, USDA APHIS; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nViroids\nViroids are plant pathogens: small, single-stranded, circular RNA particles that are much simpler than a virus. They do not have\na capsid or outer envelope, but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell. Viroids do not, however, manufacture any\nproteins, and they only produce a single, specific RNA molecule. Human diseases caused by viroids have yet to be identified.\nViroids are known to infect plants (Figure 21.18) and are responsible for crop failures and the loss of millions of dollars in\nagricultural revenue each year. Some of the plants they infect include potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, chrysanthemums,\navocados, and coconut palms.\n21.4 \u2022 Other Acellular Entities: Prions and Viroids\n527\nFigure 21.18 These potatoes have been infected by the potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV), which is typically spread when infected knives\nare used to cut healthy potatoes, which are then planted.

Their genomes contain\neither DNA or RNA\u2014never both\u2014and they replicate either\nby using the replication proteins of a host cell or by using\nproteins encoded in the viral genome. Viruses are diverse,\ninfecting archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.\nViruses consist of a nucleic acid core surrounded by a protein\ncapsid with or without an outer lipid envelope. The capsid\nshape, presence of an envelope, and core composition dictate\nsome elements of the classification of viruses. The most\ncommonly used classification method, the Baltimore\nclassification, categorizes viruses based on how they produce\ntheir mRNA.\n21.2 Virus Infections and Hosts\nPlant viruses may be transmitted either vertically from\nparent reproductive cells or horizontally through damaged\nplant tissues. Viruses of plants are responsible for significant\neconomic damage in both crop plants and plants used for\nornamentation. Animal viruses enter their hosts through\nseveral types of virus-host cell interactions and cause a\nvariety of infections. Viral infections can be either acute,\nwith a brief period of infection terminated by host immune\nresponses, or chronic, in which the infection persists.\nPersistent infections may cause chronic symptoms (hepatitis\nC), intermittent symptoms (latent viruses such a herpes\nsimplex virus 1), or even be effectively asymptomatic (human\nherpesviruses 6 and 7). Oncogenic viruses in animals have\nthe ability to cause cancer by interfering with the regulation\nof the host cell cycle.\n21.3 Prevention and Treatment of\nViral Infections\nViruses cause a variety of diseases in humans. Many of these\ndiseases can be prevented by the use of viral vaccines, which\nstimulate protective immunity against the virus without\ncausing major disease. Viral vaccines may also be used in\nactive viral infections, boosting the ability of the immune\nsystem to control or destroy the virus. A series of antiviral\ndrugs that target enzymes and other protein products of\nviral genes have been developed and used with mixed\nsuccess. Combinations of anti-HIV drugs have been used to\neffectively control the virus, extending the lifespans of\ninfected individuals. Viruses have many uses in medicines,\nsuch as in the treatment of genetic disorders, cancer, and\nbacterial infections.\n21.4 Other Acellular Entities: Prions\nand Viroids\nPrions are infectious agents that consist of protein, but no\nDNA or RNA, and seem to produce their deadly effects by\nduplicating their shapes and accumulating in tissues. They\nare thought to contribute to several progressive brain\ndisorders, including mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob\ndisease. Viroids are single-stranded RNA pathogens that\ninfect plants.

The spring\u2019s vivid blue color is from the prokaryotes that\nthrive in its very hot waters. (credit: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)\nINTRODUCTION In the recent past, scientists grouped living things into five kingdoms\u2014animals,\nplants, fungi, protists, and prokaryotes\u2014based on several criteria, such as the absence or presence of a\nnucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, the absence or presence of cell walls, multicellularity,\nand so on. In the late 20th century, the pioneering work of Carl Woese and others compared sequences of\nsmall-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA), which resulted in a more fundamental way to group\norganisms on Earth. Based on differences in the structure of cell membranes and in rRNA, Woese and\nhis colleagues proposed that all life on Earth evolved along three lineages, called domains. The domain\nBacteria comprises all organisms in the kingdom Bacteria, the domain Archaea comprises the rest of the\nprokaryotes, and the domain Eukarya comprises all eukaryotes\u2014including organisms in the kingdoms\nAnimalia, Plantae, Fungi, and Protista.\nTwo of the three domains\u2014Bacteria and Archaea\u2014are prokaryotic. Prokaryotes were the first\ninhabitants on Earth, appearing 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago. These organisms are abundant and\nubiquitous; that is, they are present everywhere. In addition to inhabiting moderate environments, they\nare found in extreme conditions: from boiling springs to permanently frozen environments in\nAntarctica; from salty environments like the Dead Sea to environments under tremendous pressure,\nsuch as the depths of the ocean; and from areas without oxygen, such as a waste management plant, to\nradioactively contaminated regions, such as Chernobyl. Prokaryotes reside in the human digestive\nsystem and on the skin, are responsible for certain illnesses, and serve an important role in the\npreparation of many foods.\nChapter Outline\n22.1 Prokaryotic\nDiversity\n22.2 Structure of\nProkaryotes:\nBacteria and\nArchaea\n22.3 Prokaryotic\nMetabolism\n22.4 Bacterial Diseases\nin Humans\n22.5 Beneficial\nProkaryotes\n22.1 Prokaryotic Diversity\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the evolutionary history of prokaryotes\n\u2022\nDiscuss the distinguishing features of extremophiles\n\u2022\nExplain why it is difficult to culture prokaryotes\nProkaryotes are ubiquitous. They cover every imaginable surface where there is sufficient moisture, and they\nalso live on and inside virtually all other living things. In the typical human body, prokaryotic cells\noutnumber human body cells by about ten to one. They comprise the majority of living things in all\necosystems. Some prokaryotes thrive in environments that are inhospitable for most living things.\nProkaryotes recycle nutrients\u2014essential substances (such as carbon and nitrogen)\u2014and they drive the\nevolution of new ecosystems, some of which are natural and others man-made. Prokaryotes have been on\nEarth since long before multicellular life appeared. Indeed, eukaryotic cells are thought to be the\ndescendants of ancient prokaryotic communities.\nProkaryotes, the First Inhabitants of Earth\nWhen and where did cellular life begin? What were the conditions on Earth when life began? We now know\nthat prokaryotes were likely the first forms of cellular life on Earth, and they existed for billions of years\nbefore plants and animals appeared. The Earth and its moon are dated at about 4.54 billion years in age. This\nestimate is based on evidence from radiometric dating of meteorite material together with other substrate\nmaterial from Earth and the moon. Early Earth had a very different atmosphere (contained less molecular\noxygen) than it does today and was subjected to strong solar radiation; thus, the first organisms probably\nwould have flourished where they were more protected, such as in the deep ocean or far beneath the surface\nof the Earth. Strong volcanic activity was common on Earth at this time, so it is likely that these first\norganisms\u2014the first prokaryotes\u2014were adapted to very high temperatures. Because early Earth was prone\nto geological upheaval and volcanic eruption, and was subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation from\nthe sun, the first organisms were prokaryotes that must have withstood these harsh conditions.\nMicrobial Mats\nMicrobial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of prokaryotic life on Earth; there is fossil\nevidence of their presence starting about 3.5 billion years ago. It is remarkable that cellular life appeared on\nEarth only a billion years after the Earth itself formed, suggesting that pre-cellular \u201clife\u201d that could replicate\nitself had evolved much earlier. A microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes (Figure 22.2) that\nincludes mostly bacteria, but also archaeans. Microbial mats are only a few centimeters thick, and they\ntypically grow where different types of materials interface, mostly on moist surfaces. The various types of\nprokaryotes that comprise them carry out different metabolic pathways, and that is the reason for their\nvarious colors. Prokaryotes in a microbial mat are held together by a glue-like sticky substance that they\nsecrete called extracellular matrix.\nThe first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents. A\nhydrothermal vent is a breakage or fissure in the Earth\u2019s surface that releases geothermally heated water.\nWith the evolution of photosynthesis about three billion years ago, some prokaryotes in microbial mats\ncame to use a more widely available energy source\u2014sunlight\u2014whereas others were still dependent on\nchemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food.\n536\nChapter 22 \u2022 Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 22.2 A microbial mat. (a) This microbial mat, about one meter in diameter, is growing over a hydrothermal vent in the Pacific Ocean\nin a region known as the \u201cPacific Ring of Fire.\u201d The mat\u2019s colony of bacteria helps retain microbial nutrients.

(credit a:\nmodification of work by Dr. Bob Embley, NOAA PMEL, Chief Scientist; credit b: modification of work by Ricardo Murga, Rodney Donlan, CDC;\nscale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nStromatolites\nFossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on Earth. A stromatolite is a sedimentary structure formed when\nminerals are precipitated out of water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat (Figure 22.3). Stromatolites form layered rocks made of\ncarbonate or silicate. Although most stromatolites are artifacts from the past, there are places on Earth where stromatolites are\nstill forming. For example, growing stromatolites have been found in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in San Diego County,\nCalifornia.\nFigure 22.3 Stromatolites. (a) These living stromatolites are located in Shark Bay, Australia. (b) These fossilized stromatolites, found in\nGlacier National Park, Montana, are nearly 1.5 billion years old. (credit a: Robert Young; credit b: P. Carrara, NPS)\nThe Ancient Atmosphere\nEvidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth\u2019s existence, the atmosphere was anoxic, meaning that there\nwas no molecular oxygen. Therefore, only those organisms that can grow without oxygen\u2014anaerobic organisms\u2014were able to\nlive. Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs, and they appeared within\none billion years of the formation of Earth. Then, cyanobacteria, also known as \u201cblue-green algae,\u201d evolved from these simple\nphototrophs at least one billion years later. It was the ancestral cyanobacteria (Figure 22.4) that began the \u201coxygenation\u201d of the\natmosphere: Increased atmospheric oxygen allowed the evolution of more efficient O2-utilizing catabolic pathways. It also\nopened up the land to increased colonization, because some O2 is converted into O3 (ozone) and ozone effectively absorbs the\nultraviolet light that could have otherwise caused lethal mutations in DNA. The current evidence suggests that the increase in O2\nconcentrations allowed the evolution of other life forms.\n22.1 \u2022 Prokaryotic Diversity\n537\nFigure 22.4 Cyanobacteria. This hot spring in Yellowstone National Park flows toward the foreground. Cyanobacteria in the spring are\ngreen, and as water flows down the gradient, the intensity of the color increases as cell density increases. The water is cooler at the edges\nof the stream than in the center, causing the edges to appear greener. (credit: Graciela Brelles-Mari\u00f1o)\nMicrobes Are Adaptable: Life in Moderate and Extreme Environments\nSome organisms have developed strategies that allow them to survive harsh conditions. Almost all prokaryotes have a cell wall, a\nprotective structure that allows them to survive in both hypertonic and hypotonic aqueous conditions. Some soil bacteria are\nable to form endospores that resist heat and drought, thereby allowing the organism to survive until favorable conditions recur.\nThese adaptations, along with others, allow bacteria to remain the most abundant life form in all terrestrial and aquatic\necosystems.\nProkaryotes thrive in a vast array of environments: Some grow in conditions that would seem very normal to us, whereas others\nare able to thrive and grow under conditions that would kill a plant or an animal. Bacteria and archaea that are adapted to grow\nunder extreme conditions are called extremophiles, meaning \u201clovers of extremes.\u201d Extremophiles have been found in all kinds of\nenvironments: the depths of the oceans, hot springs, the Arctic and the Antarctic, in very dry places, deep inside Earth, in harsh\nchemical environments, and in high radiation environments (Figure 22.5), just to mention a few. Because they have specialized\nadaptations that allow them to live in extreme conditions, many extremophiles cannot survive in moderate environments. There\nare many different groups of extremophiles: They are identified based on the conditions in which they grow best, and several\nhabitats are extreme in multiple ways. For example, a soda lake is both salty and alkaline, so organisms that live in a soda lake\nmust be both alkaliphiles and halophiles (Table 22.1). Other extremophiles, like radioresistant organisms, do not prefer an\nextreme environment (in this case, one with high levels of radiation), but have adapted to survive in it (Figure 22.5). Organisms\nlike these give us a better understanding of prokaryotic diversity and open up the possibility of finding new prokaryotic species\nthat may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic drugs or have industrial applications.\nExtremophiles and Their Preferred Conditions\nExtremophile\nConditions for Optimal Growth\nAcidophiles\npH 3 or below\nAlkaliphiles\npH 9 or above\nThermophiles\nTemperature 60\u201380 \u00b0C (140\u2013176 \u00b0F)\nHyperthermophiles\nTemperature 80\u2013122 \u00b0C (176\u2013250 \u00b0F)\nPsychrophiles\nTemperature of -15-10 \u00b0C (5-50 \u00b0F) or lower\nTable 22.1\n538\nChapter 22 \u2022 Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nExtremophile\nConditions for Optimal Growth\nHalophiles\nSalt concentration of at least 0.2 M\nOsmophiles\nHigh sugar concentration\nTable 22.1\nFigure 22.5 Radiation-tolerant prokaryotes.

(credit: modification of work by Michael Daly; scale-bar\ndata from Matt Russell)\nProkaryotes in the Dead Sea\nOne example of a very harsh environment is the Dead Sea, a hypersaline basin that is located between Jordan and Israel.\nHypersaline environments are essentially concentrated seawater. In the Dead Sea, the sodium concentration is 10 times higher\nthan that of seawater, and the water contains high levels of magnesium (about 40 times higher than in seawater) that would be\ntoxic to most living things. Iron, calcium, and magnesium, elements that form divalent ions (Fe2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+), produce\nwhat is commonly referred to as \u201chard\u201d water. Taken together, the high concentration of divalent cations, the acidic pH (6.0),\nand the intense solar radiation flux make the Dead Sea a unique, and uniquely hostile, ecosystem1 (Figure 22.6).\nWhat sort of prokaryotes do we find in the Dead Sea? The extremely salt-tolerant bacterial mats include Halobacterium,\nHaloferax volcanii (which is found in other locations, not only the Dead Sea), Halorubrum sodomense, and Halobaculum\ngomorrense, and the archaean Haloarcula marismortui, among others.\n1Bodaker, I, Itai, S, Suzuki, MT, Feingersch, R, Rosenberg, M, Maguire, ME, Shimshon, B, and others.

German physician Robert\nKoch is credited with discovering the techniques for pure culture, including staining and using growth media. Microbiologists\ntypically grow prokaryotes in the laboratory using an appropriate culture medium containing all the nutrients needed by the\ntarget organism. The medium can be liquid, broth, or solid. After an incubation time at the right temperature, there should be\nevidence of microbial growth (Figure 22.7). Koch's assistant Julius Petri invented the Petri dish, whose use persists in today\u2019s\nlaboratories. Koch worked primarily with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium that causes tuberculosis and developed\nguidelines, called Koch's postulates, to identify the organisms responsible for specific diseases. Koch's postulates continue to be\nwidely used in the medical community. Koch\u2019s postulates include that an organism can be identified as the cause of disease\nwhen it is present in all infected samples and absent in all healthy samples, and it is able to reproduce the infection after being\ncultured multiple times. Today, cultures remain a primary diagnostic tool in medicine and other areas of molecular biology.\nFigure 22.7 Bacteria growing on blood agar plates. In these agar plates, the growth medium is supplemented with red blood cells. Blood\nagar becomes transparent in the presence of hemolytic Streptococcus, which destroys red blood cells and is used to diagnose\nStreptococcus infections. The plate on the left is inoculated with non-hemolytic Staphylococcus (large white colonies), and the plate on the\nright is inoculated with hemolytic Streptococcus (tiny clear colonies). If you look closely at the right plate, you can see that the agar\nsurrounding the bacteria has turned clear. (credit: Bill Branson, NCI)\nKoch's postulates can be fully applied only to organisms that can be isolated and cultured. Some prokaryotes, however, cannot\ngrow in a laboratory setting. In fact, over 99 percent of bacteria and archaea are unculturable. For the most part, this is due to a\nlack of knowledge as to what to feed these organisms and how to grow them; they may have special requirements for growth that\nremain unknown to scientists, such as needing specific micronutrients, pH, temperature, pressure, co-factors, or co-\nmetabolites. Some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular parasites and cannot be grown outside a\nhost cell.\nIn other cases, culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions, even though the same organism could be\ncultured previously. Those organisms that cannot be cultured but are not dead are in a viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state.\nThe VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their\nsurvival. The criteria for entering into the VBNC state are not completely understood. In a process called resuscitation, the\n540\nChapter 22 \u2022 Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nprokaryote can go back to \u201cnormal\u201d life when environmental conditions improve.\nIs the VBNC state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes? In fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic waters\nare non-culturable. It has been said that only a small fraction, perhaps one percent, of prokaryotes can be cultured under\nlaboratory conditions. If these organisms are non-culturable, then how is it known whether they are present and alive?\nMicrobiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to amplify selected portions of DNA of\nprokaryotes, e.g., 16S rRNA genes, demonstrating their existence. (Recall that PCR can make billions of copies of a DNA segment\nin a process called amplification.)\nThe Ecology of Biofilms\nSome prokaryotes may be unculturable because they require the presence of other prokaryotic species. Until a couple of decades\nago, microbiologists used to think of prokaryotes as isolated entities living apart. This model, however, does not reflect the true\necology of prokaryotes, most of which prefer to live in communities where they can interact. As we have seen, a biofilm is a\nmicrobial community (Figure 22.8) held together in a gummy-textured matrix that consists primarily of polysaccharides\nsecreted by the organisms, together with some proteins and nucleic acids. Biofilms typically grow attached to surfaces. Some of\nthe best-studied biofilms are composed of prokaryotes, although fungal biofilms have also been described, as well as some\ncomposed of a mixture of fungi and bacteria.\nBiofilms are present almost everywhere: they can cause the clogging of pipes and readily colonize surfaces in industrial settings.\nIn recent, large-scale outbreaks of bacterial contamination of food, biofilms have played a major role. They also colonize\nhousehold surfaces, such as kitchen counters, cutting boards, sinks, and toilets, as well as places on the human body, such as the\nsurfaces of our teeth.\nInteractions among the organisms that populate a biofilm, together with their protective exopolysaccharidic (EPS)\nenvironment, make these communities more robust than free-living, or planktonic, prokaryotes. The sticky substance that holds\nbacteria together also excludes most antibiotics and disinfectants, making biofilm bacteria hardier than their planktonic\ncounterparts. Overall, biofilms are very difficult to destroy because they are resistant to many common forms of sterilization.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 22.8 Development of a biofilm. Five stages of biofilm development are shown. During stage 1, initial attachment, bacteria adhere to\na solid surface via weak van der Waals interactions (forces produced by induced electrical interactions between atoms). During stage 2,\nirreversible attachment, hairlike appendages called pili permanently anchor the bacteria to the surface. During stage 3, maturation I, the\nbiofilm grows through cell division and recruitment of other bacteria. An extracellular matrix composed primarily of polysaccharides holds\nthe biofilm together. During stage 4, maturation II, the biofilm continues to grow and takes on a more complex shape. During stage 5,\ndispersal, the biofilm matrix is partly broken down, allowing some bacteria to escape and colonize another surface. Micrographs of a\nPseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in each of the stages of development are shown. (credit: D. Davis, Don Monroe, PLoS)\nCompared to free-floating bacteria, bacteria in biofilms often show increased resistance to antibiotics and detergents. Why do\nyou think this might be the case?\n22.1 \u2022 Prokaryotic Diversity\n541\n22.2 Structure of Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the basic structure of a typical prokaryote\n\u2022\nDescribe important differences in structure between Archaea and Bacteria\nThere are many differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The name \"prokaryote\" suggests that prokaryotes are\ndefined by exclusion\u2014they are not eukaryotes, or organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and other internal membrane-bound\norganelles. However, all cells have four common structures: the plasma membrane, which functions as a barrier for the cell and\nseparates the cell from its environment; the cytoplasm, a complex solution of organic molecules and salts inside the cell; a\ndouble-stranded DNA genome, the informational archive of the cell; and ribosomes, where protein synthesis takes place.\nProkaryotes come in various shapes, but many fall into three categories: cocci (spherical), bacilli (rod-shaped), and spirilli\n(spiral-shaped) (Figure 22.9).\nFigure 22.9 Common prokaryotic cell types. Prokaryotes fall into three basic categories based on their shape, visualized here using\nscanning electron microscopy: (a) cocci, or spherical (a pair is shown); (b) bacilli, or rod-shaped; and (c) spirilli, or spiral-shaped. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Janice Haney Carr, Dr. Richard Facklam, CDC; credit c: modification of work by Dr. David Cox; scale-bar data from\nMatt Russell)\nThe Prokaryotic Cell\nRecall that prokaryotes are unicellular organisms that lack membrane-bound organelles or other internal membrane-bound\nstructures (Figure 22.10). Their chromosome\u2014usually single\u2014consists of a piece of circular, double-stranded DNA located in an\narea of the cell called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall outside the plasma membrane. The cell wall functions as a\nprotective layer, and it is responsible for the organism\u2019s shape. Some bacterial species have a capsule outside the cell wall. The\ncapsule enables the organism to attach to surfaces, protects it from dehydration and attack by phagocytic cells, and makes\npathogens more resistant to our immune responses. Some species also have flagella (singular, flagellum) used for locomotion,\nand pili (singular, pilus) used for attachment to surfaces including the surfaces of other cells. Plasmids, which consist of extra-\nchromosomal DNA, are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea.\n542\nChapter 22 \u2022 Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 22.10 The features of a typical prokaryotic cell. Flagella, capsules, and pili are not found in all prokaryotes.\nRecall that prokaryotes are divided into two different domains, Bacteria and Archaea, which together with Eukarya, comprise\nthe three domains of life (Figure 22.11).\nFigure 22.11 The three domains of living organisms. Bacteria and Archaea are both prokaryotes but differ enough to be placed in separate\ndomains. An ancestor of modern Archaea is believed to have given rise to Eukarya, the third domain of life. Major groups of Archaea and\nBacteria are shown.\nCharacteristics of bacterial phyla are described in Figure 22.12 and Figure 22.13. Major bacterial phyla include the\nProteobacteria, the Chlamydias, the Spirochaetes, the photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, and the Gram-positive bacteria. The\nProteobacteria are in turn subdivided into several classes, from the Alpha- to the Epsilon proteobacteria. Eukaryotic\nmitochondria are thought to be the descendants of alphaproteobacteria, while eukaryotic chloroplasts are derived from\ncyanobacteria. Archaeal phyla are described in Figure 22.14.\n22.2 \u2022 Structure of Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n543\nFigure 22.12 The Proteobacteria.

Stetter; credit\n\u201cKorarchaeota\u201d: modification of work by Office of Science of the U.S. Dept. of Energy; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe Plasma Membrane of Prokaryotes\nThe prokaryotic plasma membrane is a thin lipid bilayer (6 to 8 nanometers) that completely surrounds the cell and separates the\ninside from the outside. Its selectively permeable nature keeps ions, proteins, and other molecules within the cell and prevents\nthem from diffusing into the extracellular environment, while other molecules may move through the membrane. Recall that the\ngeneral structure of a cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer composed of two layers of lipid molecules. In archaeal cell\nmembranes, isoprene (phytanyl) chains linked to glycerol replace the fatty acids linked to glycerol in bacterial membranes. Some\narchaeal membranes are lipid monolayers instead of bilayers (Figure 22.15).\n546\nChapter 22 \u2022 Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 22.15 Bacterial and archaeal phospholipids. Archaeal phospholipids differ from those found in Bacteria and Eukarya in two ways.\nFirst, they have branched phytanyl sidechains instead of linear ones. Second, an ether bond instead of an ester bond connects the lipid to\nthe glycerol.\nThe Cell Wall of Prokaryotes\nThe cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells has a high concentration of dissolved solutes. Therefore, the osmotic pressure within the cell\nis relatively high. The cell wall is a protective layer that surrounds some cells and gives them shape and rigidity. It is located\noutside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis (bursting due to increasing volume). The chemical composition of the cell\nwall varies between Archaea and Bacteria, and also varies between bacterial species.\nBacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan, composed of polysaccharide chains that are cross-linked by unusual peptides\ncontaining both L- and D-amino acids including D-glutamic acid and D-alanine. (Proteins normally have only L-amino acids; as\na consequence, many of our antibiotics work by mimicking D-amino acids and therefore have specific effects on bacterial cell-\nwall development.) There are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan. S-layer (surface layer) proteins are also present on\nthe outside of cell walls of both Archaea and Bacteria.\nBacteria are divided into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram negative, based on their reaction to Gram staining. Note\nthat all Gram-positive bacteria belong to one phylum; bacteria in the other phyla (Proteobacteria, Chlamydias, Spirochetes,\nCyanobacteria, and others) are Gram-negative. The Gram staining method is named after its inventor, Danish scientist Hans\nChristian Gram (1853\u20131938). The different bacterial responses to the staining procedure are ultimately due to cell wall structure.\nGram-positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in Gram-negative organisms (Figure 22.16). Up to 90 percent\nof the cell-wall in Gram-positive bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan, and most of the rest is composed of acidic substances\ncalled teichoic acids. Teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane to form lipoteichoic acids.\nLipoteichoic acids anchor the cell wall to the cell membrane. Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall composed of\na few layers of peptidoglycan (only 10 percent of the total cell wall), surrounded by an outer envelope containing\nlipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipoproteins. This outer envelope is sometimes referred to as a second lipid bilayer. The chemistry\nof this outer envelope is very different, however, from that of the typical lipid bilayer that forms plasma membranes.\n22.2 \u2022 Structure of Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n547\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 22.16 Cell walls in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteria are divided into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram\nnegative. Both groups have a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan: in Gram-positive bacteria, the wall is thick, whereas in Gram-negative\nbacteria, the wall is thin. In Gram-negative bacteria, the cell wall is surrounded by an outer membrane that contains lipopolysaccharides\nand lipoproteins. Porins are proteins in this cell membrane that allow substances to pass through the outer membrane of Gram-negative\nbacteria. In Gram-positive bacteria, lipoteichoic acid anchors the cell wall to the cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by\n\"Franciscosp2\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nWhich of the following statements is true?\na.\nGram-positive bacteria have a single cell wall anchored to the cell membrane by lipoteichoic acid.\nb.\nPorins allow entry of substances into both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.\nc.\nThe cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is thick, and the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria is thin.\nd.\nGram-negative bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, whereas Gram-positive bacteria have a cell wall made of\nlipoteichoic acid.\nArchaean cell walls do not have peptidoglycan. There are four different types of archaean cell walls. One type is composed of\npseudopeptidoglycan, which is similar to peptidoglycan in morphology but contains different sugars in the polysaccharide\nchain. The other three types of cell walls are composed of polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or pure protein. Other differences\nbetween Bacteria and Archaea are seen in Table 22.2. Note that features related to DNA replication, transcription and\ntranslation in Archaea are similar to those seen in eukaryotes.\nDifferences and Similarities between Bacteria and Archaea\nStructural Characteristic\nBacteria\nArchaea\nCell type\nProkaryotic\nProkaryotic\nCell morphology\nVariable\nVariable\nCell wall\nContains peptidoglycan\nDoes not contain peptidoglycan\nCell membrane type\nLipid bilayer\nLipid bilayer or lipid monolayer\nTable 22.2\n548\nChapter 22 \u2022 Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nStructural Characteristic\nBacteria\nArchaea\nPlasma membrane lipids\nFatty acids-glycerol ester\nPhytanyl-glycerol ethers\nChromosome\nTypically circular\nTypically circular\nReplication origins\nSingle\nMultiple\nRNA polymerase\nSingle\nMultiple\nInitiator tRNA\nFormyl-methionine\nMethionine\nStreptomycin inhibition\nSensitive\nResistant\nCalvin cycle\nYes\nNo\nTable 22.2\nReproduction\nReproduction in prokaryotes is asexual and usually takes place by binary fission. (Recall that the DNA of a prokaryote is a single,\ncircular chromosome.) Prokaryotes do not undergo mitosis; instead, the chromosome is replicated and the two resulting copies\nseparate from one another, due to the growth of the cell. The prokaryote, now enlarged, is pinched inward at its equator and the\ntwo resulting cells, which are clones, separate. Binary fission does not provide an opportunity for genetic recombination or\ngenetic diversity, but prokaryotes can share genes by three other mechanisms.\nIn transformation, the prokaryote takes in DNA shed by other prokaryotes into its environment. If a nonpathogenic bacterium\ntakes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into its own chromosome, it too may become\npathogenic. In transduction, bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, may move short pieces of chromosomal DNA from\none bacterium to another. Transduction results in a recombinant organism. Archaea also have viruses that may translocate\ngenetic material from one individual to another. In conjugation, DNA is transferred from one prokaryote to another by means\nof a pilus, which brings the organisms into contact with one another, and provides a channel for transfer of DNA. The DNA\ntransferred can be in the form of a plasmid or as a composite molecule, containing both plasmid and chromosomal DNA. These\nthree processes of DNA exchange are shown in Figure 22.17.\nReproduction can be very rapid: a few minutes for some species. This short generation time coupled with mechanisms of genetic\nrecombination and high rates of mutation result in the rapid evolution of prokaryotes, allowing them to respond to\nenvironmental changes (such as the introduction of an antibiotic) very quickly.\n22.2 \u2022 Structure of Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\n549\nFigure 22.17 Gene transfer mechanisms in prokaryotes. There are three mechanisms by which prokaryotes can exchange DNA. In (a)\ntransformation, the cell takes up prokaryotic DNA directly from the environment. The DNA may remain separate as plasmid DNA or be\nincorporated into the host genome. In (b) transduction, a bacteriophage injects DNA into the cell that contains a small fragment of DNA\nfrom a different prokaryote. In (c) conjugation, DNA is transferred from one cell to another via a mating bridge, or pilus, that connects the\ntwo cells after the sex pilus draws the two bacteria close enough to form the bridge.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThe Evolution of Prokaryotes\nHow do scientists answer questions about the evolution of prokaryotes? Unlike with animals, artifacts in the fossil record of\nprokaryotes offer very little information. Fossils of ancient prokaryotes look like tiny bubbles in rock. Some scientists turn to\ngenetics and to the principle of the molecular clock, which holds that the more recently two species have diverged, the more\nsimilar their genes (and thus proteins) will be. Conversely, species that diverged long ago will have more genes that are\ndissimilar.\nScientists at the NASA Astrobiology Institute and at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory collaborated to analyze the\nmolecular evolution of 32 specific proteins common to 72 species of prokaryotes.2 The model they derived from their data\nindicates that three important groups of bacteria\u2014Actinobacteria, Deinococcus, and Cyanobacteria (collectively called\nTerrabacteria by the authors)\u2014were the first to colonize land. Actinobacteria are a group of very common Gram-positive\nbacteria that produce branched structures like fungal mycelia, and include species important in decomposition of organic\nwastes. You will recall that Deinococcus is a genus of bacterium that is highly resistant to ionizing radiation. It has a thick\npeptidoglycan layer in addition to a second external membrane, so it has features of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative\nbacteria.\nCyanobacteria are photosynthesizers, and were probably responsible for the production of oxygen on the ancient earth. The\ntimelines of divergence suggest that bacteria (members of the domain Bacteria) diverged from common ancestral species\nbetween 2.5 and 3.2 billion years ago, whereas the Archaea diverged earlier: between 3.1 and 4.1 billion years ago. Eukarya later\ndiverged from the archaean line. The work further suggests that stromatolites that formed prior to the advent of cyanobacteria\n(about 2.6 billion years ago) photosynthesized in an anoxic environment and that because of the modifications of the\nTerrabacteria for land (resistance to drying and the possession of compounds that protect the organism from excess light),\nphotosynthesis using oxygen may be closely linked to adaptations to survive on land.\n2Battistuzzi, FU, Feijao, A, and Hedges, SB.

In many cases, a prokaryote may be placed into a species clade by its defining\nmetabolic features: Can it metabolize lactose? Can it grow on citrate? Does it produce H2S? Does it ferment carbohydrates to\nproduce acid and gas? Can it grow under anaerobic conditions? Since metabolism and metabolites are the product of enzyme\npathways, and enzymes are encoded in genes, the metabolic capabilities of a prokaryote are a reflection of its genome. There are\nmany different environments on Earth with various energy and carbon sources, and variable conditions to which prokaryotes\nmay be able to adapt. Prokaryotes have been able to live in every environment from deep-water volcanic vents to Antarctic ice by\nusing whatever energy and carbon sources are available. Prokaryotes fill many niches on Earth, including involvement in\nnitrogen and carbon cycles, photosynthetic production of oxygen, decomposition of dead organisms, and thriving as parasitic,\ncommensal, or mutualistic organisms inside multicellular organisms, including humans. The very broad range of environments\nthat prokaryotes occupy is possible because they have diverse metabolic processes.\nNeeds of Prokaryotes\nThe diverse environments and ecosystems on Earth have a wide range of conditions in terms of temperature, available nutrients,\nacidity, salinity, oxygen availability, and energy sources. Prokaryotes are very well equipped to make their living out of a vast\narray of nutrients and environmental conditions. To live, prokaryotes need a source of energy, a source of carbon, and some\nadditional nutrients.\nMacronutrients\nCells are essentially a well-organized assemblage of macromolecules and water. Recall that macromolecules are produced by the\npolymerization of smaller units called monomers. For cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life, they need certain\nsubstances, collectively called nutrients. When prokaryotes grow in nature, they must obtain their nutrients from the\nenvironment. Nutrients that are required in large amounts are called macronutrients, whereas those required in smaller or\ntrace amounts are called micronutrients. Just a handful of elements are considered macronutrients\u2014carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,\nnitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. (A mnemonic for remembering these elements is the acronym CHONPS.)\nWhy are these macronutrients needed in large amounts? They are the components of organic compounds in cells, including\nwater. Carbon is the major element in all macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and many other\ncompounds. Carbon accounts for about 50 percent of the composition of the cell. In contrast, nitrogen represents only 12\npercent of the total dry weight of a typical cell. Nitrogen is a component of proteins, nucleic acids, and other cell constituents.\nMost of the nitrogen available in nature is either atmospheric nitrogen (N2) or another inorganic form. Diatomic (N2) nitrogen,\nhowever, can be converted into an organic form only by certain microorganisms, called nitrogen-fixing organisms. Both\nhydrogen and oxygen are part of many organic compounds and of water. Phosphorus is required by all organisms for the\nsynthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. Sulfur is part of the structure of some amino acids such as cysteine and methionine,\nand is also present in several vitamins and coenzymes. Other important macronutrients are potassium (K), magnesium (Mg),\ncalcium (Ca), and sodium (Na). Although these elements are required in smaller amounts, they are very important for the\nstructure and function of the prokaryotic cell.\nMicronutrients\nIn addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require various metallic elements in small amounts. These are referred to as\nmicronutrients or trace elements. For example, iron is necessary for the function of the cytochromes involved in electron-\ntransport reactions. Some prokaryotes require other elements\u2014such as boron (B), chromium (Cr), and manganese\n(Mn)\u2014primarily as enzyme cofactors.\nThe Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Energy\nProkaryotes are classified both by the way they obtain energy, and by the carbon source they use for producing organic\nmolecules. These categories are summarized in Table 22.3. Prokaryotes can use different sources of energy to generate the ATP\nneeded for biosynthesis and other cellular activities. Phototrophs (or phototrophic organisms) obtain their energy from\nsunlight. Phototrophs trap the energy of light using chlorophylls, or in a few cases, bacterial rhodopsin. (Rhodopsin-using\nphototrophs, oddly, are phototrophic, but not photosynthetic, since they do not fix carbon.) Chemotrophs (or chemosynthetic\n22.3 \u2022 Prokaryotic Metabolism\n551\norganisms) obtain their energy from chemical compounds. Chemotrophs that can use organic compounds as energy sources are\ncalled chemoorganotrophs. Those that can use inorganic compounds, like sulfur or iron compounds, as energy sources are called\nchemolithotrophs.\nEnergy-producing pathways may be either aerobic, using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor, or anaerobic, using either\nsimple inorganic compounds or organic molecules as the terminal electron acceptor. Since prokaryotes lived on Earth for nearly\na billion years before photosynthesis produced significant amounts of oxygen for aerobic respiration, many species of both\nBacteria and Archaea are anaerobic and their metabolic activities are important in the carbon and nitrogen cycles discussed\nbelow.\nThe Ways in Which Prokaryotes Obtain Carbon\nProkaryotes not only can use different sources of energy, but also different sources of carbon compounds. Autotrophic\nprokaryotes synthesize organic molecules from carbon dioxide. In contrast, heterotrophic prokaryotes obtain carbon from\norganic compounds. To make the picture more complex, the terms that describe how prokaryotes obtain energy and carbon can\nbe combined. Thus, photoautotrophs use energy from sunlight, and carbon from carbon dioxide and water, whereas\nchemoheterotrophs obtain both energy and carbon from an organic chemical source. Chemolithoautotrophs obtain their energy\nfrom inorganic compounds, and they build their complex molecules from carbon dioxide. Finally, prokaryotes that get their\nenergy from light, but their carbon from organic compounds, are photoheterotrophs. The table below (Table 22.3) summarizes\ncarbon and energy sources in prokaryotes.\nCarbon and Energy Sources in Prokaryotes\nEnergy Source\nElectron Source\nCarbon Source\nNutritional Type\nLight\n(phototroph)\nOrganic material\n(organotroph)\nOrganic material\n(heterotroph)\nPhotoorganoheterotroph\nCarbon dioxide\n(autotroph)\nInorganic material\n(lithotroph)\nOrganic material\n(heterotroph)\nCarbon dioxide\n(autotroph)\nPhotolithoautotroph\nChemicals\n(chemotroph)\nOrganic material\n(organotroph)\nOrganic material\n(heterotroph)\nChemoorganoheterotroph\nCarbon dioxide\n(autotroph)\nInorganic material\n(lithotroph)\nOrganic material\n(heterotroph)\nChemolithoheterotroph\nCarbon dioxide\n(autotroph)\nChemolithoautotroph\nTable 22.3\nRole of Prokaryotes in Ecosystems\nProkaryotes are ubiquitous: There is no niche or ecosystem in which they are not present. Prokaryotes play many roles in the\nenvironments they occupy. The roles they play in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are vital to life on Earth. In addition, the current\n552\nChapter 22 \u2022 Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nscientific consensus suggests that metabolically interactive prokaryotic communities may have been the basis for the emergence\nof eukaryotic cells.\nProkaryotes and the Carbon Cycle\nCarbon is one of the most important macronutrients, and prokaryotes play an important role in the carbon cycle (Figure 22.18).\nThe carbon cycle traces the movement of carbon from inorganic to organic compounds and back again. Carbon is cycled through\nEarth\u2019s major reservoirs: land, the atmosphere, aquatic environments, sediments and rocks, and biomass. In a way, the carbon\ncycle echoes the role of the \u201cfour elements\u201d first proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher, Empedocles: fire, water, earth, and\nair. Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by land plants and marine prokaryotes, and is returned to the atmosphere\nvia the respiration of chemoorganotrophic organisms, including prokaryotes, fungi, and animals. Although the largest carbon\nreservoir in terrestrial ecosystems is in rocks and sediments, that carbon is not readily available.\nParticipants in the carbon cycle are roughly divided among producers, consumers, and decomposers of organic carbon\ncompounds. The primary producers of organic carbon compounds from CO2 are land plants and photosynthetic bacteria. A\nlarge amount of available carbon is found in living land plants. A related source of carbon compounds is humus, which is a\nmixture of organic materials from dead plants and prokaryotes that have resisted decomposition. (The term \"humus,\" by the\nway, is the root of the word \"human.\") Consumers such as animals and other heterotrophs use organic compounds generated by\nproducers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Other bacteria and fungi, collectively called decomposers, carry out\nthe breakdown (decomposition) of plants and animals and their organic compounds. Most carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is\nderived from the respiration of microorganisms that decompose dead animals, plants, and humus.\nIn aqueous environments and their anoxic sediments, there is another carbon cycle taking place. In this case, the cycle is based\non one-carbon compounds. In anoxic sediments, prokaryotes, mostly archaea, produce methane (CH4). This methane moves\ninto the zone above the sediment, which is richer in oxygen and supports bacteria called methane oxidizers that oxidize\nmethane to carbon dioxide, which then returns to the atmosphere.\nFigure 22.18 The carbon cycle. Prokaryotes play a significant role in continuously moving carbon through the biosphere. (credit:\nmodification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)\nProkaryotes and the Nitrogen Cycle\nNitrogen is a very important element for life because it is a major constituent of proteins and nucleic acids. It is a\n22.3 \u2022 Prokaryotic Metabolism\n553\nmacronutrient, and in nature, it is recycled from organic compounds to ammonia, ammonium ions, nitrate, nitrite, and\nnitrogen gas by many processes, many of which are carried out only by prokaryotes. As illustrated in Figure 22.19, prokaryotes\nare key to the nitrogen cycle. The largest pool of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen (N2) from the\nair, but this nitrogen is not usable by plants, which are primary producers. Gaseous nitrogen is transformed, or \u201cfixed\u201d into\nmore readily available forms, such as ammonia (NH3), through the process of nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria\ninclude Azotobacter in soil and the ubiquitous photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Some nitrogen fixing bacteria, like Rhizobium,\nlive in symbiotic relationships in the roots of legumes. Another source of ammonia is ammonification, the process by which\nammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. The ammonium ion is progressively\noxidized by different species of bacteria in a process called nitrification. The nitrification process begins with the conversion of\nammonium to nitrite (NO2-), and continues with the conversion of nitrite to nitrate. Nitrification in soils is carried out by\nbacteria belonging to the genera Nitrosomas, Nitrobacter, and Nitrospira. Most nitrogen in soil is in the form of ammonium\n(NH4+) or nitrate (NO3-). Ammonia and nitrate can be used by plants or converted to other forms.\nAmmonia released into the atmosphere, however, represents only 15 percent of the total nitrogen released; the rest is as N2 and\nN2O (nitrous oxide). Ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes, yielding N2 as the final product. Denitrifying\nbacteria reverse the process of nitrification, reducing the nitrate from soils to gaseous compounds such as N2O, NO, and N2.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 22.19 The nitrogen cycle.

Unfortunately, the tenancy of some species can have harmful\neffects and cause disease. Bacteria or other infectious agents that cause harm to their human hosts are called pathogens.\nDevastating pathogen-borne diseases and plagues, both viral and bacterial in nature, have affected humans and their ancestors\nfor millions of years. The true cause of these diseases was not understood until modern scientific thought developed, and many\npeople thought that diseases were a \u201cspiritual punishment.\u201d Only within the past several centuries have people understood that\nstaying away from afflicted persons, disposing of the corpses and personal belongings of victims of illness, and sanitation\npractices reduced their own chances of getting sick.\nEpidemiologists study how diseases are transmitted and how they affect a population. Often, they must following the course of\nan epidemic\u2014a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time. In contrast, a\npandemic is a widespread, and usually worldwide, epidemic. An endemic disease is a disease that is always present, usually at\nlow incidence, in a population.\nLong History of Bacterial Disease\nThere are records about infectious diseases as far back as 3000 B.C. A number of significant pandemics caused by bacteria have\nbeen documented over several hundred years. Some of the most memorable pandemics led to the decline of cities and entire\nnations.\nIn the 21st century, infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide, despite advances made in medical\nresearch and treatments in recent decades. A disease spreads when the pathogen that causes it is passed from one person to\nanother. For a pathogen to cause disease, it must be able to reproduce in the host\u2019s body and damage the host in some way.\nThe Plague of Athens\nIn 430 B.C., the Plague of Athens killed one-quarter of the Athenian troops who were fighting in the great Peloponnesian War\nand weakened Athens\u2019s dominance and power. The plague impacted people living in overcrowded Athens as well as troops\naboard ships that had to return to Athens. The source of the plague may have been identified recently when researchers from the\nUniversity of Athens were able to use DNA from teeth recovered from a mass grave. The scientists identified nucleotide\nsequences from a pathogenic bacterium, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Figure 22.20), which causes typhoid fever.3 This\ndisease is commonly seen in overcrowded areas and has caused epidemics throughout recorded history.\n3Papagrigorakis MJ, Synodinos PN, and Yapijakis C. Ancient typhoid epidemic reveals possible ancestral strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi.\nInfect Genet Evol 7 (2007): 126\u20137, Epub 2006 Jun.\n22.4 \u2022 Bacterial Diseases in Humans\n555\nFigure 22.20 Salmonella enterica. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the causative agent of Typhoid fever, is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped\ngamma proteobacterium. Typhoid fever, which is spread through feces, causes intestinal hemorrhage, high fever, delirium, and dehydration.\nToday, between 16 and 33 million cases of this re-emerging disease occur annually, resulting in over 200,000 deaths. Carriers of the\ndisease can be asymptomatic. In a famous case in the early 1900s, a cook named Mary Mallon (\u201cTyphoid Mary\u201d) unknowingly spread the\ndisease to over fifty people, three of whom died. Other serotypes of Salmonella cause food poisoning. (credit: modification of work by NCI,\nCDC)\nBubonic Plagues\nFrom 541 to 750, the Plague of Justinian, an outbreak of what was likely bubonic plague, eliminated one-quarter to one-half of\nthe human population in the eastern Mediterranean region. The population in Europe dropped by 50 percent during this\noutbreak. Astoundingly, bubonic plague would strike Europe more than once!\nBubonic plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. One of the most devastating pandemics attributed to bubonic plague\nwas the Black Death (1346 to 1361). It is thought to have originated in China and spread along the Silk Road, a network of land\nand sea trade routes, to the Mediterranean region and Europe, carried by fleas living on black rats that were always present on\nships. The Black Death was probably named for the tissue necrosis (Figure 22.21c) that can be one of the symptoms. The \"buboes\"\nof bubonic plague were painfully swollen areas of lymphatic tissue. A pneumonic form of the plague, spread by the coughing and\nsneezing of infected individuals, spreads directly from human to human and can cause death within a week. The pneumonic\nform was responsible for the rapid spread of the Black Death in Europe. The Black Death reduced the world\u2019s population from an\nestimated 450 million to about 350 to 375 million. Bubonic plague struck London yet again in the mid-1600s (Figure 22.21). In\nmodern times, approximately 1,000 to 3,000 cases of plague arise globally each year, and a \u201csylvatic\u201d form of plague, carried by\nfleas living on rodents such as prairie dogs and black footed ferrets, infects 10 to 20 people annually in the American Southwest.\nAlthough contracting bubonic plague before antibiotics meant almost certain death, the bacterium responds to several types of\nmodern antibiotics, and mortality rates from plague are now very low.\n556\nChapter 22 \u2022 Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 22.21 The Black Death. The (a) Great Plague of London killed an estimated 200,000 people, or about 20 percent of the city\u2019s\npopulation. The causative agent, the (b) bacterium Yersinia pestis, is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium from the class\nGammaproteobacteria. The disease is transmitted through the bite of an infected flea, which is carried on a rodent. Symptoms include\nswollen lymph nodes, fever, seizure, vomiting of blood, and (c) gangrene.

Over the centuries, Europeans tended to develop\ngenetic immunity to endemic infectious diseases, but when European conquerors reached the western hemisphere, they\nbrought with them disease-causing bacteria and viruses, which triggered epidemics that completely devastated many diverse\npopulations of Native Americans, who had no natural resistance to many European diseases. It has been estimated that up to 90\npercent of Native Americans died from infectious diseases after the arrival of Europeans, making conquest of the New World a\nforegone conclusion.\nEmerging and Re-emerging Diseases\nThe distribution of a particular disease is dynamic. Changes in the environment, the pathogen, or the host population can\ndramatically impact the spread of a disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an emerging disease (Figure\n22.22) is one that has appeared in a population for the first time, or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in\nincidence or geographic range. This definition also includes re-emerging diseases that were previously under control.\nApproximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are zoonotic diseases. Zoonoses are\ndiseases that primarily infect animals but can be transmitted to humans; some are of viral origin and some are of bacterial\norigin. Brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re-emerging in some regions, and necrotizing fasciitis\n(commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria) has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years for unknown reasons.\n22.4 \u2022 Bacterial Diseases in Humans\n557\nFigure 22.22 Emerging diseases. The map shows regions where bacterial diseases are emerging or re-emerging. (credit: modification of\nwork by NIH)\nSome of the present emerging diseases are not actually new, but are diseases that were catastrophic in the past (Figure 22.23).\nThey devastated populations and became dormant for a while, just to come back, sometimes more virulent than before, as was\nthe case with bubonic plague. Other diseases, like tuberculosis, were never eradicated but were under control in some regions of\nthe world until coming back, mostly in urban centers with high concentrations of immunocompromised people. WHO has\nidentified certain diseases whose worldwide re-emergence should be monitored. Among these are three viral diseases (dengue\nfever, yellow fever, and zika), and three bacterial diseases (diphtheria, cholera, and bubonic plague). The war against infectious\ndiseases has no foreseeable end.\nFigure 22.23 Lyme Disease. Lyme disease often, but not always, results in (a) a characteristic bullseye rash. The disease is caused by a (b)\nGram-negative spirochete bacterium of the genus Borrelia. The bacteria (c) infect ticks, which in turn infect mice. Deer are the preferred\nsecondary host, but the ticks also may feed on humans. Untreated, the disease causes chronic disorders in the nervous system, eyes,\njoints, and heart. The disease is named after Lyme, Connecticut, where an outbreak occurred in 1995 and has subsequently spread. The\ndisease is not new, however. Genetic evidence suggests that \u00d6tzi the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old mummy found in the Alps, was infected\nwith Borrelia. (credit a: James Gathany, CDC; credit b: CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nFoodborne Diseases\nProkaryotes are everywhere: They readily colonize the surface of any type of material, and food is not an exception. Most of the\ntime, prokaryotes colonize food and food-processing equipment in the form of a biofilm, as we have discussed earlier.\nOutbreaks of bacterial infection related to food consumption are common. A foodborne disease (commonly called \u201cfood\npoisoning\u201d) is an illness resulting from the consumption the pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or other parasites that contaminate\nfood. Although the United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) has reported that \u201c76 million people get sick, more than 300,000 are hospitalized, and 5,000 Americans die\n558\nChapter 22 \u2022 Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\neach year from foodborne illness.\u201d\nThe characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time. In the past, it was relatively common to hear about sporadic\ncases of botulism, the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Some\nof the most common sources for this bacterium were non-acidic canned foods, homemade pickles, and processed meat and\nsausages. The can, jar, or package created a suitable anaerobic environment where Clostridium could grow. Proper sterilization\nand canning procedures have reduced the incidence of this disease.\nWhile people may tend to think of foodborne illnesses as associated with animal-based foods, most cases are now linked to\nproduce. There have been serious, produce-related outbreaks associated with raw spinach in the United States and with\nvegetable sprouts in Germany, and these types of outbreaks have become more common. The raw spinach outbreak in 2006 was\nproduced by the bacterium E. coli serotype O157:H7. A serotype is a strain of bacteria that carries a set of similar antigens on its\ncell surface, and there are often many different serotypes of a bacterial species. Most E. coli are not particularly dangerous to\nhumans, but serotype O157:H7 can cause bloody diarrhea and is potentially fatal.\nAll types of food can potentially be contaminated with bacteria. Recent outbreaks of Salmonella reported by the CDC occurred in\nfoods as diverse as peanut butter, alfalfa sprouts, and eggs. A deadly outbreak in Germany in 2010 was caused by E. coli\ncontamination of vegetable sprouts (Figure 22.24). The strain that caused the outbreak was found to be a new serotype not\npreviously involved in other outbreaks, which indicates that E. coli is continuously evolving. Outbreaks of listeriosis, due to\ncontamination of meats, raw cheeses, and frozen or fresh vegetables with Listeria monocytogenes, are becoming more\nfrequent.\nFigure 22.24 Foodborne pathogens. (a) Vegetable sprouts grown at an organic farm were the cause of an (b) E. coli outbreak that killed 32\npeople and sickened 3,800 in Germany in 2011. The strain responsible, E. coli O104:H4, produces Shiga toxin, a substance that inhibits\nprotein synthesis in the host cell. The toxin (c) destroys red blood cells resulting in bloody diarrhea. Deformed red blood cells clog the\ncapillaries of the kidney, which can lead to kidney failure, as happened to 845 patients in the 2011 outbreak. Kidney failure is usually\nreversible, but some patients experience kidney problems years later. (credit c: NIDDK, NIH)\nBiofilms and Disease\nRecall that biofilms are microbial communities that are very difficult to destroy. They are responsible for diseases such as\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease, otitis media (ear infections), and various infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. They produce dental\nplaque and colonize catheters, prostheses, transcutaneous and orthopedic devices, contact lenses, and internal devices such as\npacemakers. They also form in open wounds and burned tissue. In healthcare environments, biofilms grow on hemodialysis\nmachines, mechanical ventilators, shunts, and other medical equipment. In fact, 65 percent of all infections acquired in the\nhospital (nosocomial infections) are attributed to biofilms. Biofilms are also related to diseases contracted from food because\nthey colonize the surfaces of vegetable leaves and meat, as well as food-processing equipment that isn\u2019t adequately cleaned.\nBiofilm infections develop gradually and may not cause immediate symptoms. They are rarely resolved by host defense\nmechanisms. Once an infection by a biofilm is established, it is very difficult to eradicate, because biofilms tend to be resistant\nto most methods used to control microbial growth, including antibiotics. The matrix that attaches the cells to a substrate and to\nother another protects the cells from antibiotics or drugs. In addition, since biofilms grow slowly, they are less responsive to\nagents that interfere with cell growth. It has been reported that biofilms can resist up to 1,000 times the antibiotic\nconcentrations used to kill the same bacteria when they are free-living or planktonic. An antibiotic dose that large would harm\nthe patient; therefore, scientists are working on new ways to get rid of biofilms.\n22.4 \u2022 Bacterial Diseases in Humans\n559\nAntibiotics: Are We Facing a Crisis?\nThe word antibiotic comes from the Greek anti meaning \u201cagainst\u201d and bios meaning \u201clife.\u201d An antibiotic is a chemical, produced\neither by microbes or synthetically, that is hostile to or prevents the growth of other organisms. Today\u2019s media often address\nconcerns about an antibiotic crisis. Are the antibiotics that easily treated bacterial infections in the past becoming obsolete? Are\nthere new \u201csuperbugs\u201d\u2014bacteria that have evolved to become more resistant to our arsenal of antibiotics? Is this the beginning\nof the end of antibiotics? All these questions challenge the healthcare community.\nOne of the main causes of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is overexposure to antibiotics. The imprudent and excessive use of\nantibiotics has resulted in the natural selection of resistant forms of bacteria. The antibiotic kills most of the infecting bacteria,\nand therefore only the resistant forms remain. These resistant forms reproduce, resulting in an increase in the proportion of\nresistant forms over non-resistant ones. In addition to transmission of resistance genes to progeny, lateral transfer of resistance\ngenes on plasmids can rapidly spread these genes through a bacterial population. A major misuse of antibiotics is in patients\nwith viral infections like colds or the flu, against which antibiotics are useless. Another problem is the excessive use of\nantibiotics in livestock. The routine use of antibiotics in animal feed promotes bacterial resistance as well. In the United States,\n70 percent of the antibiotics produced are fed to animals. These antibiotics are given to livestock in low doses, which maximize\nthe probability of resistance developing, and these resistant bacteria are readily transferred to humans.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch a recent news report (http://openstax.org/l/antibiotics) on the problem of routine antibiotic administration to livestock\nand antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nOne of the Superbugs: MRSA\nThe imprudent use of antibiotics has paved the way for the expansion of resistant bacterial populations. For example,\nStaphylococcus aureus, often called \u201cstaph,\u201d is a common bacterium that can live in the human body and is usually easily treated\nwith antibiotics. However, a very dangerous strain, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has made the news\nover the past few years (Figure 22.25). This strain is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics, including methicillin,\namoxicillin, penicillin, and oxacillin. MRSA can cause infections of the skin, but it can also infect the bloodstream, lungs,\nurinary tract, or sites of injury. While MRSA infections are common among people in healthcare facilities, they have also\nappeared in healthy people who haven\u2019t been hospitalized, but who live or work in tight populations (like military personnel and\nprisoners). Researchers have expressed concern about the way this latter source of MRSA targets a much younger population\nthan those residing in care facilities. The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that, among MRSA-afflicted\npersons in healthcare facilities, the average age is 68, whereas people with \u201ccommunity-associated MRSA\u201d (CA-MRSA) have an\naverage age of 23.4\n4Naimi, TS, LeDell, KH, Como-Sabetti, K, et al.

(credit:\nmodification of work by Janice Haney Carr; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nIn summary, the medical community is facing an antibiotic crisis. Some scientists believe that after years of being protected\nfrom bacterial infections by antibiotics, we may be returning to a time in which a simple bacterial infection could again\ndevastate the human population. Researchers are developing new antibiotics, but it takes many years of research and clinical\ntrials, plus financial investments in the millions of dollars, to generate an effective and approved drug.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nEpidemiologist\nEpidemiology is the study of the occurrence, distribution, and determinants of health and disease in a population. It is,\ntherefore, part of public health. An epidemiologist studies the frequency and distribution of diseases within human populations\nand environments.\nEpidemiologists collect data about a particular disease and track its spread to identify the original mode of transmission. They\nsometimes work in close collaboration with historians to try to understand the way a disease evolved geographically and over\ntime, tracking the natural history of pathogens. They gather information from clinical records, patient interviews, surveillance,\nand any other available means. That information is used to develop strategies, such as vaccinations (Figure 22.26), and design\npublic health policies to reduce the incidence of a disease or to prevent its spread. Epidemiologists also conduct rapid\ninvestigations in case of an outbreak to recommend immediate measures to control it.\nAn epidemiologist has a bachelor\u2019s degree, plus a master\u2019s degree in public health (MPH). Many epidemiologists are also\nphysicians (and have an M.D. or D.O degree), or they have a Ph.D. in an associated field, such as biology or microbiology.\n22.4 \u2022 Bacterial Diseases in Humans\n561\nFigure 22.26 Vaccination. Vaccinations can slow the spread of communicable diseases. (credit: modification of work by Daniel Paquet)\n22.5 Beneficial Prokaryotes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain the need for nitrogen fixation and how it is accomplished\n\u2022\nDescribe the beneficial effects of bacteria that colonize our skin and digestive tracts\n\u2022\nIdentify prokaryotes used during the processing of food\n\u2022\nDescribe the use of prokaryotes in bioremediation\nFortunately, only a few species of prokaryotes are pathogenic! Prokaryotes also interact with humans and other organisms in a\nnumber of ways that are beneficial. For example, prokaryotes are major participants in the carbon and nitrogen cycles. They\nproduce or process nutrients in the digestive tracts of humans and other animals. Prokaryotes are used in the production of\nsome human foods, and also have been recruited for the degradation of hazardous materials. In fact, our life would not be\npossible without prokaryotes!\nCooperation between Bacteria and Eukaryotes: Nitrogen Fixation\nNitrogen is a very important element to living things, because it is part of nucleotides and amino acids that are the building\nblocks of nucleic acids and proteins, respectively. Nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in terrestrial ecosystems, with\natmospheric nitrogen, N2, providing the largest pool of available nitrogen. However, eukaryotes cannot use atmospheric,\ngaseous nitrogen to synthesize macromolecules. Fortunately, nitrogen can be \u201cfixed,\u201d meaning it is converted into a more\naccessible form\u2014ammonia (NH3)\u2014either biologically or abiotically.\nAbiotic nitrogen fixation occurs as a result of physical processes such as lightning or by industrial processes. Biological nitrogen\nfixation (BNF) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes: soil bacteria, cyanobacteria, and Frankia spp. (filamentous bacteria\ninteracting with actinorhizal plants such as alder, bayberry, and sweet fern). After photosynthesis, BNF is the most important\nbiological process on Earth. The overall nitrogen fixation equation below represents a series of redox reactions (Pi stands for\ninorganic phosphate).\nThe total fixed nitrogen through BNF is about 100 to 180 million metric tons per year, which contributes about 65 percent of the\nnitrogen used in agriculture.\nCyanobacteria are the most important nitrogen fixers in aquatic environments. In soil, members of the genera Clostridium and\nAzotobacter are examples of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Other bacteria live symbiotically with legume plants,\nproviding the most important source of fixed nitrogen. Symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free-living organisms by\na factor of 10. Soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form nodules,\nspecialized structures where nitrogen fixation occurs (Figure 22.27). Nitrogenase, the enzyme that fixes nitrogen, is inactivated\nby oxygen, so the nodule provides an oxygen-free area for nitrogen fixation to take place. The oxygen is sequestered by a form of\n562\nChapter 22 \u2022 Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nplant hemoglobin called leghemoglobin, which protects the nitrogenase, but releases enough oxygen to support respiratory\nactivity.\nSymbiotic nitrogen fixation provides a natural and inexpensive plant fertilizer: It reduces atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia,\nwhich is easily usable by plants. The use of legumes is an excellent alternative to chemical fertilization and is of special interest\nto sustainable agriculture, which seeks to minimize the use of chemicals and conserve natural resources. Through symbiotic\nnitrogen fixation, the plant benefits from using an endless source of nitrogen: the atmosphere. The bacteria benefit from using\nphotosynthates (carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis) from the plant and having a protected niche. In addition, the\nsoil benefits from being naturally fertilized. Therefore, the use of rhizobia as biofertilizers is a sustainable practice.\nWhy are legumes so important? Some, like soybeans, are key sources of agricultural protein. Some of the most important\nlegumes consumed by humans are soybeans, peanuts, peas, chickpeas, and beans. Other legumes, such as alfalfa, are used to\nfeed cattle.\nFigure 22.27 Nitrogen-fixation nodules on soybean roots. Soybean (Glycine max) is a legume that interacts symbiotically with the soil\nbacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum to form specialized structures on the roots called nodules where nitrogen fixation occurs. (credit:\nUSDA)\nEveryday Connection\nMicrobes on the Human Body\nThe commensal bacteria that inhabit our skin and gastrointestinal tract do a host of good things for us. They protect us from\npathogens, help us digest our food, and produce some of our vitamins and other nutrients. These activities have been\nknown for a long time. More recently, scientists have gathered evidence that these bacteria may also help regulate our\nmoods, influence our activity levels, and even help control weight by affecting our food choices and absorption patterns. The\nHuman Microbiome Project has begun the process of cataloging our normal bacteria (and archaea) so we can better\nunderstand these functions.\nA particularly fascinating example of our normal flora relates to our digestive systems. People who take high doses of\nantibiotics tend to lose many of their normal gut bacteria, allowing a naturally antibiotic-resistant species called\nClostridium difficile to overgrow and cause severe gastric problems, especially chronic diarrhea (Figure 22.28). Obviously,\ntrying to treat this problem with antibiotics only makes it worse. However, it has been successfully treated by giving the\npatients fecal transplants from healthy donors to reestablish the normal intestinal microbial community. Clinical trials are\nunderway to ensure the safety and effectiveness of this technique.\n22.5 \u2022 Beneficial Prokaryotes\n563\nEarly Biotechnology: Cheese, Bread, Wine, Beer, and Yogurt\nAccording to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, biotechnology is \u201cany technological application that uses\nbiological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use.\"5 The\nconcept of \u201cspecific use\u201d involves some sort of commercial application. Genetic engineering, artificial selection, antibiotic\nproduction, and cell culture are current topics of study in biotechnology and will be described in later chapters. However,\nhumans were using prokaryotes before the term biotechnology was even coined. Some of the products of this early\nbiotechnology are as familiar as cheese, bread, wine, beer, and yogurt, which employ both bacteria and other microbes, such as\nyeast, a fungus (Figure 22.29).\nFigure 22.28 Clostridium difficile. This scanning electron micrograph shows Clostridium difficile, a Gram-positive, rod-shaped\nbacterium that causes severe diarrhea. Infection commonly occurs after the normal gut fauna are eradicated by antibiotics, and in the\nhospital can be deadly to seriously ill patients. (credit: modification of work by CDC, HHS; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nScientists are also discovering that the absence of certain key microbes from our intestinal tract may set us up for a variety\nof problems. This seems to be particularly true regarding the appropriate functioning of the immune system. There are\nintriguing findings that suggest that the absence of these microbes is an important contributor to the development of\nallergies and some autoimmune disorders. Research is currently underway to test whether adding certain microbes to our\ninternal ecosystem may help in the treatment of these problems, as well as in treating some forms of autism.\n5http://www.cbd.int/convention/articles/?a=cbd-02 (http://openstax.org/l/UN_convention) , United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity: Article 2:\nUse of Terms.\n564\nChapter 22 \u2022 Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 22.29 Some foods produced by microorganisms. Some of the products derived from the use of prokaryotes in early biotechnology\ninclude (a) cheese, (b) wine, (c) beer and bread, and (d) yogurt. (credit bread: modification of work by F. Rodrigo/Wikimedia Commons;\ncredit wine: modification of work by Jon Sullivan; credit beer and bread: modification of work by Kris Miller; credit yogurt: modification of\nwork by Jon Sullivan)\nCheese production began around 4,000 to 7,000 years ago when humans began to breed animals and process their milk.\nFermentation in this case preserves nutrients: Milk will spoil relatively quickly, but when processed as cheese, it is more stable.\nAs for beer, the oldest records of brewing are about 6,000 years old and were an integral part of the Sumerian culture. Evidence\nindicates that the Sumerians discovered fermentation by chance. Wine has been produced for about 4,500 years, and evidence\nsuggests that cultured milk products, like yogurt, have existed for at least 4,000 years.\nUsing Prokaryotes to Clean up Our Planet: Bioremediation\nMicrobial bioremediation is the use of prokaryotes (or microbial metabolism) to remove pollutants. Bioremediation has been\nused to remove agricultural chemicals (e.g., pesticides, fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface.\nCertain toxic metals and oxides, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by bioremediation.\nThe reduction of SeO4-2 to SeO3-2 and to Se0 (metallic selenium) is a method used to remove selenium ions from water. Mercury\n(Hg) is an example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation. As an active ingredient of\nsome pesticides, mercury is used in industry and is also a by-product of certain processes, such as battery production. Methyl\nmercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments, but it is highly toxic because it accumulates in\nliving tissues. Several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of toxic mercury into nontoxic forms. These\nbacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can convert Hg+2 into Hg0, which is nontoxic to humans.\nOne of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil\nspills. The significance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent years,\nsuch as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska (1989) (Figure 22.30), the Prestige oil spill in Spain (2002), the spill into the\nMediterranean from a Lebanon power plant (2006), and more recently, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (2010). In the case of\noil spills in the ocean, ongoing natural bioremediation tends to occur, since there are oil-consuming bacteria in the ocean prior\nto the spill. In addition to these naturally occurring oil-degrading bacteria, humans select and engineer bacteria that possess\nthe same capability with increased efficacy and spectrum of hydrocarbon compounds that can be processed. Bioremediation is\n22.5 \u2022 Beneficial Prokaryotes\n565\nenhanced by the addition of inorganic nutrients that help bacteria to grow.\nSome hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria feed on hydrocarbons in the oil droplet, breaking down the hydrocarbons into smaller\nsubunits. Some species, such as Alcanivorax borkumensis, produce surfactants that solubilize the oil (making it soluble in\nwater), whereas other bacteria degrade the oil into carbon dioxide. Under ideal conditions, it has been reported that up to 80\npercent of the nonvolatile components in oil can be degraded within one year of the spill. Other oil fractions containing\naromatic and highly branched hydrocarbon chains are more difficult to remove and remain in the environment for longer\nperiods of time.\nFigure 22.30 Prokaryotes and bioremediation. (a) Cleaning up oil after the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska, workers hosed oil from beaches and\nthen used a floating boom to corral the oil, which was finally skimmed from the water surface. Some species of bacteria are able to\nsolubilize and degrade the oil. (b) One of the most catastrophic consequences of oil spills is the damage to fauna.

Hot springs and hydrothermal vents may\nhave been the environments in which life began. Microbial\nmats are thought to represent the earliest forms of life on\nEarth. A microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of\nprokaryotes that grows at interfaces between different types\nof material, mostly on moist surfaces. Fossilized microbial\nmats are called stromatolites and consist of laminated\norgano-sedimentary structures formed by precipitation of\nminerals by prokaryotes. They represent the earliest fossil\nrecord of life on Earth.\nDuring the first two billion years, the atmosphere was anoxic\nand only anaerobic organisms were able to live.\nCyanobacteria evolved from early phototrophs and began the\noxygenation o the atmosphere. The increase in oxygen\nconcentration allowed the evolution of other life forms.\nBacteria and archaea grow in virtually every environment.\nThose that survive under extreme conditions are called\nextremophiles (extreme lovers). Some prokaryotes cannot\ngrow in a laboratory setting, but they are not dead. They are\nin the viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state. The VBNC\nstate occurs when prokaryotes enter a dormant state in\nresponse to environmental stressors. Most prokaryotes are\ncolonial and prefer to live in communities where interactions\ntake place. A biofilm is a microbial community held together\nin a gummy-textured matrix.\n22.2 Structure of Prokaryotes:\nBacteria and Archaea\nProkaryotes (domains Archaea and Bacteria) are single-\ncelled organisms that lack a nucleus. They have a single piece\nof circular DNA in the nucleoid area of the cell. Most\nprokaryotes have a cell wall that lies outside the boundary of\nthe plasma membrane. Some prokaryotes may have\nadditional structures such as a capsule, flagella, and pili.\nBacteria and Archaea differ in the lipid composition of their\ncell membranes and the characteristics of the cell wall. In\narchaeal membranes, phytanyl units, rather than fatty acids,\nare linked to glycerol. Some archaeal membranes are lipid\nmonolayers instead of bilayers.\nThe cell wall is located outside the cell membrane and\nprevents osmotic lysis. The chemical composition of cell\nwalls varies between species. Bacterial cell walls contain\npeptidoglycan. Archaean cell walls do not have\npeptidoglycan, but they may have pseudopeptidoglycan,\npolysaccharides, glycoproteins, or protein-based cell walls.\nBacteria can be divided into two major groups: Gram\npositive and Gram negative, based on the Gram stain\nreaction. Gram-positive organisms have a thick\npeptidoglycan layer fortified with teichoic acids. Gram-\nnegative organisms have a thin cell wall and an outer\nenvelope containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins.\nProkaryotes can transfer DNA from one cell to another by\nthree mechanisms: transformation (uptake of environmental\nDNA), transduction (transfer of genomic DNA via viruses),\nand conjugation (transfer of DNA by direct cell contact).\n22.3 Prokaryotic Metabolism\nAs the oldest living inhabitants of Earth, prokaryotes are also\nthe most metabolically diverse; they flourish in many\ndifferent environments with various energy and carbon\nsources, variable temperature, pH, pressure, oxygen and\nwater availability. Nutrients required in large amounts are\ncalled macronutrients, whereas those required in trace\namounts are called micronutrients or trace elements.\nMacronutrients include C, H, O, N, P, S, K, Mg, Ca, and Na.\nIn addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require\nvarious metallic elements for growth and enzyme function.\nProkaryotes use different sources of energy to assemble\nmacromolecules from smaller molecules. Phototrophs obtain\ntheir energy from sunlight, whereas chemotrophs obtain\nenergy from chemical compounds. Energy-producing\npathways may be either aerobic or anaerobic.\nProkaryotes play roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycles.\nProducers capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and\nconvert it to organic compounds. Consumers (animals and\nother chemoorganotrophic organisms) use organic\ncompounds generated by producers and release carbon\ndioxide into the atmosphere by respiration. Carbon dioxide\n568\nChapter 22 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nis also returned to the atmosphere by the microbial\ndecomposers of dead organisms. Nitrogen also cycles in and\nout of living organisms, from organic compounds to\nammonia, ammonium ions, nitrite, nitrate, and nitrogen\ngas. Prokaryotes are essential for most of these conversions.\nGaseous nitrogen is transformed into ammonia through\nnitrogen fixation. Ammonia is anaerobically catabolized by\nsome prokaryotes, yielding N2 as the final product.\nNitrification is the conversion of ammonium into nitrite.\nNitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria.\nDenitrification is also performed by bacteria and transforms\nnitrate from soils into gaseous nitrogen compounds, such as\nN2O, NO, and N2.\n22.4 Bacterial Diseases in Humans\nSome prokaryotes are human pathogens. Devastating\ndiseases and plagues have been among us since early times\nand remain among the leading causes of death worldwide.\nEmerging diseases are those rapidly increasing in incidence\nor geographic range. They can be new or re-emerging\ndiseases (previously under control). Many emerging diseases\naffecting humans originate in animals (zoonoses), such as\nbrucellosis. A group of re-emerging bacterial diseases\nrecently identified by WHO for monitoring include bubonic\nplague, diphtheria, and cholera. Foodborne diseases result\nfrom the consumption of food contaminated with food,\npathogenic bacteria, viruses, or parasites.\nSome bacterial infections have been associated with\nbiofilms: Legionnaires\u2019 disease, otitis media, and infection of\npatients with cystic fibrosis. Biofilms can grow on human\ntissues, like dental plaque; colonize medical devices; and\ncause infection or produce foodborne disease by growing on\nthe surfaces of food and food-processing equipment.\nBiofilms are resistant to most of the methods used to control\nmicrobial growth. The excessive use of antibiotics has\nresulted in a major global problem, since resistant forms of\nbacteria have been selected over time. A very dangerous\nstrain, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),\nhas wreaked havoc recently across the world.\n22.5 Beneficial Prokaryotes\nPathogens are only a small percentage of all prokaryotes. In\nfact, prokaryotes provide essential services to humans and\nother organisms. Nitrogen, which is not usable by\neukaryotes in its plentiful atmospheric form, can be \u201cfixed,\u201d\nor converted into ammonia (NH3) either biologically or\nabiotically. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is exclusively\ncarried out by prokaryotes, and constitutes the second most\nimportant biological process on Earth. Although some\nterrestrial nitrogen is fixed by free-living bacteria, most BNF\ncomes from the symbiotic interaction between soil rhizobia\nand the roots of legume plants.\nHuman life is only possible due to the action of microbes,\nboth those in the environment and those species that call us\nhome. Internally, they help us digest our food, produce vital\nnutrients for us, protect us from pathogenic microbes, and\nhelp train our immune systems to function properly.\nMicrobial bioremediation is the use of microbial metabolism\nto remove pollutants. Bioremediation has been used to\nremove agricultural chemicals that leach from soil into\ngroundwater and the subsurface. Toxic metals and oxides,\nsuch as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be\nremoved by bioremediation. Probably one of the most useful\nand interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for\nbioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil spills.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

Therefore, it became an interesting challenge to deal with the world of microorganisms once\nmicroscopes were developed a few centuries ago. Many different naming schemes were used over the last\ncouple of centuries, but it has become the most common practice to refer to eukaryotes that are not land\nplants, animals, or fungi as protists.\nThis name was first suggested by Ernst Haeckel in the late nineteenth century. It has been applied in\nmany contexts and has been formally used to represent a kingdom-level taxon called Protista. However,\nmany modern systematists (biologists who study the relationships among organisms) are beginning to\nshy away from the idea of formal ranks such as kingdom and phylum. Instead, they are naming taxa as\ngroups of organisms thought to include all the descendants of a last common ancestor (monophyletic\ngroup). During the past two decades, the field of molecular genetics has demonstrated that some\nprotists are more related to animals, plants, or fungi than they are to other protists. Therefore, not\nincluding animals, plants, and fungi make the kingdom Protista a paraphyletic group, or one that does\nnot include all descendents of its common ancestor. For this reason, protist lineages originally classified\ninto the kingdom Protista continue to be examined and debated. In the meantime, the term \u201cprotist\u201d still\nis used informally to describe this tremendously diverse group of eukaryotes.\nMost protists are microscopic, unicellular organisms that are abundant in soil, freshwater, brackish, and\nmarine environments. They are also common in the digestive tracts of animals and in the vascular\ntissues of plants. Others invade the cells of other protists, animals, and plants. Not all protists are\nmicroscopic. Some have huge, macroscopic cells, such as the plasmodia (giant amoebae) of myxomycete\nslime molds or the marine green alga Caulerpa, which can have single cells that can be several meters in\nsize. Some protists are multicellular, such as the red, green, and brown seaweeds. It is among the\nprotists that one finds the wealth of ways that organisms can grow.\nChapter Outline\n23.1 Eukaryotic Origins\n23.2 Characteristics of\nProtists\n23.3 Groups of Protists\n23.4 Ecology of Protists\n23.1 Eukaryotic Origins\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nList the unifying characteristics of eukaryotes\n\u2022\nDescribe what scientists know about the origins of eukaryotes based on the last common\nancestor\n\u2022\nExplain the endosymbiotic theory\nOrganisms are classified into three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The first two lineages\ncomprise all prokaryotic cells, and the third contains all eukaryotes. A very sparse fossil record prevents us\nfrom determining what the first members of each of these lineages looked like, so it is possible that all the\nevents that led to the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes will remain unknown. However,\ncomparative biology of extant (living) organisms and the limited fossil record provide some insight into the\nevolution of Eukarya.\nThe earliest fossils found appear to be those of domain Bacteria, most likely cyanobacteria. They are about\n3.5 to 3.8 billion years old and are recognizable because of their relatively complex structure and, for\nprokaryotes, relatively large cells. Most other prokaryotes have small cells, 1 or 2 \u00b5m in size, and would be\ndifficult to pick out as fossils. Fossil stromatolites suggest that at least some prokaryotes lived in interactive\ncommunities, and evidence from the structure of living eukaryotic cells suggests that it was similar ancestral\ninteractions that gave rise to the eukaryotes. Most living eukaryotes have cells measuring 10 \u00b5m or greater.\nStructures this size, which might be fossilized remains of early eukaryotes, appear in the geological record\nin deposits dating to about 2.1 billion years ago.\nCharacteristics of Eukaryotes\nData from these fossils, as well as from the study of living genomes, have led comparative biologists to\nconclude that living eukaryotes are all descendants of a single common ancestor. Mapping the\ncharacteristics found in all major groups of eukaryotes reveals that the following characteristics are present\nin at least some of the members of each major lineage, or during some part of their life cycle, and therefore\nmust have been present in the last common ancestor.\n1.\nCells with nuclei surrounded by a nuclear envelope with nuclear pores: This is the single characteristic\nthat is both necessary and sufficient to define an organism as a eukaryote. All extant eukaryotes have\ncells with nuclei.\n2.\nMitochondria: Most extant eukaryotes have \"typical\" mitochondria, although some eukaryotes have\nvery reduced mitochondrial \u201cremnants\u201d and a few lack detectable mitochondria.\n3.\nCytoskeleton of microtubules and microfilaments: Eukaryotic cells possess the structural and motility\ncomponents called actin microfilaments and microtubules. All extant eukaryotes have these\ncytoskeletal elements.\n4.\nFlagella and cilia: Organelles associated with cell motility. Some extant eukaryotes lack flagella and/or\ncilia, but their presence in related lineages suggests that they are descended from ancestors that\npossessed these organelles.\n5.\nChromosomes organized by histones: Each eukaryotic chromosome consists of a linear DNA molecule\ncoiled around basic (alkaline) proteins called histones. The few eukaryotes with chromosomes lacking\nhistones clearly evolved from ancestors that had them.\n6.\nMitosis: A process of nuclear division in which replicated chromosomes are divided and separated\nusing elements of the cytoskeleton. Mitosis is universally present in eukaryotes.\n7.\nSexual reproduction: A meiotic process of nuclear division and genetic recombination unique to\neukaryotes. During this process, diploid nuclei at one stage of the life cycle undergo meiosis to yield\nhaploid nuclei, which subsequently fuse together (karyogamy) to create a diploid zygote nucleus.\n8.\nCell walls: It might be reasonable to conclude that the last common ancestor could make cell walls\nduring some stage of its life cycle, simple because cell walls were present in their prokaryote precursors.\nHowever, not enough is known about eukaryotes\u2019 cell walls and their development to know how much\nhomology exists between those of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. If the last common ancestor could make\ncell walls, it is clear that this ability must have been lost in many groups.\n574\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nEndosymbiosis and the Evolution of Eukaryotes\nBefore we discuss the origins of eukaryotes, it is first important to understand that all extant eukaryotes are likely the\ndescendants of a chimera-like organism that was a composite of a host cell and the cell(s) of an alpha-proteobacterium that\n\u201ctook up residence\u201d inside it. This major theme in the origin of eukaryotes is known as endosymbiosis, one cell engulfing\nanother such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells benefit. Over many generations, a symbiotic relationship can result in\ntwo organisms that depend on each other so completely that neither could survive on its own. Endosymbiotic events likely\ncontributed to the origin of the last common ancestor of today\u2019s eukaryotes and to later diversification in certain lineages of\neukaryotes (Figure 23.5). Similar endosymbiotic associations are not uncommon in living eukaryotes. Before explaining this\nfurther, it is necessary to consider metabolism in prokaryotes.\nProkaryotic Metabolism\nMany important metabolic processes arose in prokaryotes; however, some of these processes, such as nitrogen fixation, are\nnever found in eukaryotes. The process of aerobic respiration is found in all major lineages of eukaryotes, and it is localized in\nthe mitochondria. Aerobic respiration is also found in many lineages of prokaryotes, but it is not present in all of them, and a\ngreat deal of evidence suggests that such anaerobic prokaryotes never carried out aerobic respiration nor did their ancestors.\nWhile today\u2019s atmosphere is about 20 percent molecular oxygen (O2), geological evidence shows that it originally lacked O2.\nWithout oxygen, aerobic respiration would not be expected, and living things would have relied on anaerobic respiration or the\nprocess of fermentation instead. At some point before about 3.8 billion years ago, some prokaryotes began using energy from\nsunlight to power anabolic processes that reduce carbon dioxide to form organic compounds. That is, they evolved the ability to\nphotosynthesize. Hydrogen, derived from various sources, was \u201ccaptured\u201d using light-powered reactions to reduce fixed carbon\ndioxide in the Calvin cycle. The group of Gram-negative bacteria that gave rise to cyanobacteria used water as the hydrogen\nsource and released O2 as a \u201cwaste\u201d product.\nEventually, the amount of photosynthetic oxygen built up in some environments to levels that posed a risk to living organisms,\nsince it can damage many organic compounds. Various metabolic processes evolved that protected organisms from oxygen, one\nof which, aerobic respiration, also generated high levels of ATP. It became widely present among prokaryotes, including in a\nfree-living group we now call alpha-proteobacteria. Organisms that did not acquire aerobic respiration had to remain in\noxygen-free environments. Originally, oxygen-rich environments were likely localized around places where cyanobacteria were\nabundant and active, but by about 2 billion years ago, geological evidence shows that oxygen was building up to higher\nconcentrations in the atmosphere. Oxygen levels similar to today\u2019s levels only arose within the last 700 million years.\nRecall that the first fossils that we believe to be eukaryotes date to about 2 billion years old, so they seemed to have evolved and\ndiversified rapidly as oxygen levels were increasing. Also, recall that all extant eukaryotes descended from an ancestor with\nmitochondria. These organelles were first observed by light microscopists in the late 1800s, where they appeared to be\nsomewhat worm-shaped structures that seemed to be moving around in the cell. Some early observers suggested that they\nmight be bacteria living inside host cells, but these hypotheses remained unknown or rejected in most scientific communities.\nEndosymbiotic Theory\nAs cell biology developed in the twentieth century, it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for\nproducing ATP using aerobic respiration, in which oxygen was the final electron acceptor. In the 1960s, American biologist Lynn\nMargulis of Boston University developed the endosymbiotic theory, which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of\none cell engulfing another, one living within another, and coevolving over time until the separate cells were no longer\nrecognizable as such and shared genetic control of a mutualistic metabolic pathway to produce ATP. In 1967, Margulis\nintroduced new data to support her work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence.\nAlthough Margulis\u2019s work initially was met with resistance, this basic component of this once-revolutionary hypothesis is now\nwidely accepted, with work progressing on uncovering the steps involved in this evolutionary process and the key players\ninvolved.\nWhile the metabolic organelles and genes responsible for many energy-harvesting processes appear to have had their origins in\nbacteria, our nuclear genes and the molecular machinery responsible for replication and expression appear to be more closely\nrelated to those found in the Archaea. Much remains to be clarified about how this relationship occurred; this continues to be an\nexciting field of discovery in biology. For instance, it is not known whether the endosymbiotic event that led to mitochondria\noccurred before or after the host cell had a nucleus. Such organisms would be among the extinct precursors of the last common\nancestor of eukaryotes.\n23.1 \u2022 Eukaryotic Origins\n575\nMitochondria\nOne of the major features distinguishing prokaryotes from eukaryotes is the presence of mitochondria, or their reduced\nderivatives, in virtually all eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells may contain anywhere from one to several thousand mitochondria,\ndepending on the cell\u2019s level of energy consumption, in humans being most abundant in the liver and skeletal muscles. Each\nmitochondrion measures 1 to 10 or greater micrometers in length and exists in the cell as an organelle that can be ovoid to\nworm-shaped to intricately branched (Figure 23.2). However, although they may have originated as free-living aerobic\norganisms, mitochondria can no longer survive and reproduce outside the cell.\nMitochondria have several features that suggest their relationship to alpha-proteobacteria (Figure 23.5). Alpha-proteobacteria\nare a large group of bacteria that includes species symbiotic with plants, disease organisms that can infect humans via ticks, and\nmany free-living species that use light for energy. Mitochondria have their own genomes, with a circular chromosome stabilized\nby attachments to the inner membrane. Mitochondria also have special ribosomes and transfer RNAs that resemble these same\ncomponents in prokaryotes. An intriguing feature of mitochondria is that many of them exhibit minor differences from the\nuniversal genetic code. However, many of the genes for respiratory proteins are now relocated in the nucleus. When these genes\nare compared to those of other organisms, they appear to be of alpha-proteobacterial origin. In some eukaryotic groups, such\ngenes are found in the mitochondria, whereas in other groups, they are found in the nucleus. This has been interpreted as\nevidence that over evolutionary time, genes have been transferred from the endosymbiont chromosome to those of the host\ngenome. This apparent \u201closs\u201d of genes by the endosymbiont is probably one explanation why mitochondria cannot live without a\nhost.\nAnother line of evidence supporting the idea that mitochondria were derived by endosymbiosis comes from the structure of the\nmitochondrian itself. Most mitochondria are shaped like alpha-proteobacteria and are surrounded by two membranes; the\ninner membrane is bacterial in nature whereas the outer membrane is eukaryotic in nature. This is exactly what one would\nexpect if one membrane-bound organism was engulfed into a vacuole by another membrane-bound organism. The outer\nmitochondrial membrane was derived by the enclosing vesicle, while the inner membrane was derived from the plasma\nmembrane of the endosymbiont. The mitochondrial inner membrane is extensive and involves substantial infoldings called\ncristae that resemble the textured, outer surface of alpha-proteobacteria. The matrix and inner membrane are rich with the\nenzymes necessary for aerobic respiration.\nFigure 23.2 Mitochondria. In this transmission electron micrograph of mitochondria in a mammalian lung cell, the cristae, infoldings of the\nmitochondrial inner membrane, can be seen in cross-section. (credit: Louise Howard)\nThe third line of evidence comes from the production of new mitochondria. Mitochondria divide independently by a process\nthat resembles binary fission in prokaryotes. Mitochondria arise only from previous mitochondria; they are not formed from\nscratch (de novo) by the eukaryotic cell. Mitochondria may fuse together; and they may be moved around inside the cell by\ninteractions with the cytoskeleton. They reproduce within their enclosing cell and are distributed with the cytoplasm when a cell\ndivides or two cells fuse. Therefore, although these organelles are highly integrated into the eukaryotic cell, they still reproduce\nas if they were independent organisms within the cell. However, their reproduction is synchronized with the activity and\ndivision of the cell. These features all support the theory that mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotes.\nSome living eukaryotes are anaerobic and cannot survive in the presence of too much oxygen. However, a few appear to lack\norganelles that could be recognized as mitochondria. In the 1970s and on into the early 1990s, many biologists suggested that\n576\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nsome of these eukaryotes were descended from ancestors whose lineages had diverged from the lineage of mitochondrion-\ncontaining eukaryotes before endosymbiosis occurred. Later findings suggest that reduced organelles are found in most, if not\nall, anaerobic eukaryotes, and that virtually all eukaryotes appear to carry some genes in their nuclei that are of mitochondrial\norigin.\nIn addition to the aerobic generation of ATP, mitochondria have several other metabolic functions. One of these functions is to\ngenerate clusters of iron and sulfur that are important cofactors of many enzymes. Such functions are often associated with the\nreduced mitochondrion-derived organelles of anaerobic eukaryotes. The protist Monocercomonoides, an inhabitant of\nvertebrate digestive tracts, appears to be an exception; it has no mitochondria and its genome contains neither genes derived\nfrom mitochondria nor nuclear genes related to mitochondrial maintenance. However, it is related to other protists with\nreduced mitochondria and probably represents an end-point in mitochondrial reduction. Although most biologists accept that\nthe last common ancestor of eukaryotes had mitochondria, it appears that the complex relationship between mitochondria and\ntheir host cell continues to evolve.\nPlastids\nSome groups of eukaryotes are photosynthetic. Their cells contain, in addition to the standard eukaryotic organelles, another\nkind of organelle called a plastid. When such cells are carrying out photosynthesis, their plastids are rich in the pigment\nchlorophyll a and a range of other pigments, called accessory pigments, which are involved in harvesting energy from light.\nPhotosynthetic plastids are called chloroplasts (Figure 23.3).\nFigure 23.3 Chloroplasts. (a) This chloroplast cross-section illustrates its elaborate inner membrane organization. Stacks of thylakoid\nmembranes compartmentalize photosynthetic enzymes and provide scaffolding for chloroplast DNA. (b) In this micrograph of Elodea sp.,\nthe chloroplasts can be seen as small green spheres. (credit b: modification of work by Brandon Zierer; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nLike mitochondria, plastids appear to have an endosymbiotic origin. This hypothesis was also proposed and championed with\nthe first direct evidence by Lynn Margulis. We now know that plastids are derived from cyanobacteria that lived inside the cells\nof an ancestral, aerobic, heterotrophic eukaryote. This is called primary endosymbiosis, and plastids of primary origin are\nsurrounded by two membranes. However, the best evidence is that the acquisition of cyanobacterial endosymbionts has\nhappened twice in the history of eukaryotes. In one case, the common ancestor of the major lineage/supergroup Archaeplastida\ntook on a cyanobacterial endosymbiont; in the other, the ancestor of the small amoeboid rhizarian taxon, Paulinella, took on a\ndifferent cyanobacterial endosymbiont. Almost all photosynthetic eukaryotes are descended from the first event, and only a\ncouple of species are derived from the other, which in evolutionary terms, appears to be more recent.\nCyanobacteria are a group of Gram-negative bacteria with all the conventional structures of the group. However, unlike most\nprokaryotes, they have extensive, internal membrane-bound sacs called thylakoids. Chlorophyll is a component of these\nmembranes, as are many of the proteins of the light reactions of photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria also have the peptidoglycan wall\nand lipopolysaccharide layer associated with Gram-negative bacteria.\nChloroplasts of primary endosymbiotic origin have thylakoids, a circular DNA chromosome, and ribosomes similar to those of\ncyanobacteria. As in mitochondria, each chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes. The outer membrane is thought to be\nderived from the enclosing vacuole of the host, and the inner membrane is thought to be derived from the plasma membrane of\nthe cyanobacterial endosymbiont. In the group of Archaeplastida called the glaucophytes and in the rhizarian Paulinella, a thin\npeptidoglycan layer is still present between the outer and inner plastid membranes. All other plastids lack this relict of the\n23.1 \u2022 Eukaryotic Origins\n577\ncyanobacterial wall.\nThere is also, as with the case of mitochondria, strong evidence that many of the genes of the endosymbiont were transferred to\nthe nucleus. Plastids, like mitochondria, cannot live independently outside the host. In addition, like mitochondria, plastids are\nderived from the division of other plastids and never built from scratch. Researchers have suggested that the endosymbiotic\nevent that led to Archaeplastida occurred 1 to 1.5 billion years ago, at least 5 hundred million years after the fossil record suggests\nthat eukaryotes were present.\nNot all plastids in eukaryotes are derived directly from primary endosymbiosis. Some of the major groups of algae became\nphotosynthetic by secondary endosymbiosis, that is, by taking in either green algae or red algae (both from Archaeplastida) as\nendosymbionts (Figure 23.4). Numerous microscopic and genetic studies have supported this conclusion. Secondary plastids\nare surrounded by three or more membranes, and some secondary plastids even have clear remnants of the nucleus\n(nucleomorphs) of endosymbiotic algae. There are even cases where tertiary or higher-order endosymbiotic events are the best\nexplanations for the features of some eukaryotic plastids.\nFigure 23.4 Algae. (a) Red algae and (b) green algae (seen here by light microscopy) share similar DNA sequences with photosynthetic\ncyanobacteria. Scientists speculate that, in a process called endosymbiosis, an ancestral prokaryote engulfed a photosynthetic\ncyanobacterium that evolved into modern-day chloroplasts.

Fahnenstiel, NOAA; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\n578\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 23.5 The Endosymbiotic Theory. The first eukaryote may have originated from an ancestral prokaryote that had undergone\nmembrane proliferation, compartmentalization of cellular function (into a nucleus, lysosomes, and an endoplasmic reticulum), and the\nestablishment of endosymbiotic relationships with an aerobic prokaryote, and, in some cases, a photosynthetic prokaryote, to form\nmitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively.\nWhat evidence is there that mitochondria were incorporated into the ancestral eukaryotic cell before chloroplasts?\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nSecondary Endosymbiosis in Chlorarachniophytes\nEndosymbiosis involves one cell engulfing another to produce, over time, a coevolved relationship in which neither cell could\nsurvive alone. The chloroplasts of red and green algae, for instance, are derived from the engulfment of a photosynthetic\ncyanobacterium by an ancestral prokaryote.\nThis evidence suggests the possibility that an ancestral cell (already containing a photosynthetic endosymbiont) was engulfed by\nanother eukaryote cell, resulting in a secondary endosymbiosis. Molecular and morphological evidence suggest that the\nchlorarachniophyte protists are derived from a secondary endosymbiotic event. Chlorarachniophytes are rare algae indigenous\nto tropical seas and sand. They are classified into the Rhizarian supergroup. Chlorarachniophytes are reticulose amoebae,\nextending thin cytoplasmic strands that interconnect them with other chlorarachniophytes in a cytoplasmic network. These\nprotists are thought to have originated when a eukaryote engulfed a green alga, the latter of which had previously established an\nendosymbiotic relationship with a photosynthetic cyanobacterium (Figure 23.6).\n23.1 \u2022 Eukaryotic Origins\n579\nFigure 23.6 Secondary endosymbiosis. The hypothesized process of several endosymbiotic events leading to the evolution of\nchlorarachniophytes is shown. In a primary endosymbiotic event, a heterotrophic eukaryote consumed a cyanobacterium. In a secondary\nendosymbiotic event, the cell resulting from primary endosymbiosis was consumed by a second cell. The resulting organelle became a\nplastid in modern chlorarachniophytes.\nSeveral lines of evidence support that chlorarachniophytes evolved from secondary endosymbiosis. The chloroplasts contained\nwithin the green algal endosymbionts still are capable of photosynthesis, making chlorarachniophytes photosynthetic. The\ngreen algal endosymbiont also exhibits a vestigial nucleus. In fact, it appears that chlorarachniophytes are the products of an\nevolutionarily recent secondary endosymbiotic event. The plastids of chlorarachniophytes are surrounded by four membranes:\nThe first two correspond to the inner and outer membranes of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium, the third corresponds to\nplasma membrane of the green alga, and the fourth corresponds to the vacuole that surrounded the green alga when it was\nengulfed by the chlorarachniophyte ancestor. In other lineages that involved secondary endosymbiosis, only three membranes\ncan be identified around plastids. This is currently interpreted as a sequential loss of a membrane during the course of\nevolution.\nThe process of secondary endosymbiosis is not unique to chlorarachniophytes. Secondary plastids are also found in the\nExcavates and the Chromalveolates. In the Excavates, secondary endosymbiosis of green algae led to euglenid protists, while in\nthe Chromalveolates, secondary endosymbiosis of red algae led to the evolution of plastids in dinoflagellates, apicomplexans,\nand stramenopiles.\n23.2 Characteristics of Protists\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the cell structure characteristics of protists\n\u2022\nDescribe the metabolic diversity of protists\n\u2022\nDescribe the life cycle diversity of protists\nThere are over 100,000 described living species of protists, and it is unclear how many undescribed species may exist. Since\nmany protists live as commensals or parasites in other organisms and these relationships are often species-specific, there is a\nhuge potential for protist diversity that matches the diversity of their hosts. Because the name \"protist\" serves as a catchall term\nfor eukaryotic organisms that are not animal, plant, or fungi, it is not surprising that very few characteristics are common to all\nprotists. On the other hand, familiar characteristics of plants and animals are foreshadowed in various protists.\nCell Structure\nThe cells of protists are among the most elaborate of all cells. Multicellular plants, animals, and fungi are embedded among the\nprotists in eukaryotic phylogeny. In most plants and animals and some fungi, complexity arises out of multicellularity, tissue\nspecialization, and subsequent interaction because of these features. Although a rudimentary form of multicellularity exists\namong some of the organisms labelled as \u201cprotists,\u201d those that have remained unicellular show how complexity can evolve in the\nabsence of true multicellularity, with the differentiation of cellular morphology and function. A few protists live as colonies that\nbehave in some ways as a group of free-living cells and in other ways as a multicellular organism. Some protists are composed of\nenormous, multinucleate, single cells that look like amorphous blobs of slime, or in other cases, like ferns. In some species of\n580\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nprotists, the nuclei are different sizes and have distinct roles in protist cell function.\nSingle protist cells range in size from less than a micrometer to three meters in length to hectares! Protist cells may be enveloped\nby animal-like cell membranes or plant-like cell walls. Others are encased in glassy silica-based shells or wound with pellicles of\ninterlocking protein strips. The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor, preventing the protist from being torn or pierced\nwithout compromising its range of motion.\nMetabolism\nProtists exhibit many forms of nutrition and may be aerobic or anaerobic. Those that store energy by photosynthesis belong to a\ngroup of photoautotrophs and are characterized by the presence of chloroplasts. Other protists are heterotrophic and consume\norganic materials (such as other organisms) to obtain nutrition. Amoebas and some other heterotrophic protist species ingest\nparticles by a process called phagocytosis, in which the cell membrane engulfs a food particle and brings it inward, pinching off\nan intracellular membranous sac, or vesicle, called a food vacuole (Figure 23.7). In some protists, food vacuoles can be formed\nanywhere on the body surface, whereas in others, they may be restricted to the base of a specialized feeding structure. The\nvesicle containing the ingested particle, the phagosome, then fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic enzymes to produce a\nphagolysosome, and the food particle is broken down into small molecules that can diffuse into the cytoplasm and be used in\ncellular metabolism. Undigested remains ultimately are expelled from the cell via exocytosis.\nFigure 23.7 Phagocytosis. The stages of phagocytosis include the engulfment of a food particle, the digestion of the particle using\nhydrolytic enzymes contained within a lysosome, and the expulsion of undigested materials from the cell.\nSubtypes of heterotrophs, called saprobes, absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes. Some protists can\nfunction as mixotrophs, obtaining nutrition by photoautotrophic or heterotrophic routes, depending on whether sunlight or\norganic nutrients are available.\nMotility\nThe majority of protists are motile, but different types of protists have evolved varied modes of movement (Figure 23.8). Some\nprotists have one or more flagella, which they rotate or whip. Others are covered in rows or tufts of tiny cilia that they beat in a\ncoordinated manner to swim. Still others form cytoplasmic extensions called pseudopodia anywhere on the cell, anchor the\npseudopodia to a substrate, and pull themselves forward. Some protists can move toward or away from a stimulus, a movement\nreferred to as taxis. For example, movement toward light, termed phototaxis, is accomplished by coupling their locomotion\nstrategy with a light-sensing organ.\n23.2 \u2022 Characteristics of Protists\n581\nFigure 23.8 Locomotor organelles in protists. Protists use various methods for transportation. (a) Paramecium waves hair-like appendages\ncalled cilia to propel itself. (b) Amoeba uses lobe-like pseudopodia to anchor itself to a solid surface and pull itself forward. (c) Euglena\nuses a whip-like tail called a flagellum to propel itself.\nLife Cycles\nProtists reproduce by a variety of mechanisms. Most undergo some form of asexual reproduction, such as binary fission, to\nproduce two daughter cells. In protists, binary fission can be divided into transverse or longitudinal, depending on the axis of\norientation; sometimes Paramecium exhibits this method. Some protists such as the true slime molds exhibit multiple fission\nand simultaneously divide into many daughter cells. Others produce tiny buds that go on to divide and grow to the size of the\nparental protist.\nSexual reproduction, involving meiosis and fertilization, is common among protists, and many protist species can switch from\nasexual to sexual reproduction when necessary. Sexual reproduction is often associated with periods when nutrients are\ndepleted or environmental changes occur. Sexual reproduction may allow the protist to recombine genes and produce new\nvariations of progeny, some of which may be better suited to surviving changes in a new or changing environment. However,\nsexual reproduction is often associated with resistant cysts that are a protective, resting stage. Depending on habitat of the\nspecies, the cysts may be particularly resistant to temperature extremes, desiccation, or low pH. This strategy allows certain\nprotists to \u201cwait out\u201d stressors until their environment becomes more favorable for survival or until they are carried (such as by\nwind, water, or transport on a larger organism) to a different environment, because cysts exhibit virtually no cellular\nmetabolism.\nProtist life cycles range from simple to extremely elaborate. Certain parasitic protists have complicated life cycles and must\ninfect different host species at different developmental stages to complete their life cycle. Some protists are unicellular in the\nhaploid form and multicellular in the diploid form, a strategy employed by animals. Other protists have multicellular stages in\nboth haploid and diploid forms, a strategy called alternation of generations, analogous to that used by plants.\nHabitats\nNearly all protists exist in some type of aquatic environment, including freshwater and marine environments, damp soil, and\neven snow. Several protist species are parasites that infect animals or plants. A few protist species live on dead organisms or\ntheir wastes, and contribute to their decay.\n23.3 Groups of Protists\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe representative protist organisms from each of the six presently recognized supergroups of\neukaryotes\n\u2022\nIdentify the evolutionary relationships of plants, animals, and fungi within the six presently recognized\nsupergroups of eukaryotes\n\u2022\nIdentify defining features of protists in each of the six supergroups of eukaryotes.\nIn the span of several decades, the Kingdom Protista has been disassembled because sequence analyses have revealed new\ngenetic (and therefore evolutionary) relationships among these eukaryotes. Moreover, protists that exhibit similar\nmorphological features may have evolved analogous structures because of similar selective pressures\u2014rather than because of\n582\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nrecent common ancestry. This phenomenon, called convergent evolution, is one reason why protist classification is so\nchallenging. The emerging classification scheme groups the entire domain Eukarya into six \u201csupergroups\u201d that contain all of the\nprotists as well as animals, plants, and fungi that evolved from a common ancestor (Figure 23.9). Each of the supergroups is\nbelieved to be monophyletic, meaning that all organisms within each supergroup are believed to have evolved from a single\ncommon ancestor, and thus all members are most closely related to each other than to organisms outside that group. There is\nstill evidence lacking for the monophyly of some groups. Each supergroup can be viewed as representing one of many variants\non eukaryotic cell structure. In each group, one or more of the defining characters of the eukaryotic cell\u2014the nucleus, the\ncytoskeleton, and the endosymbiotic organelles\u2014may have diverged from the \"typical\" pattern.\nFigure 23.9 Eukaryotic supergroups. This diagram shows a proposed classification of the domain Eukarya. Currently, the domain Eukarya is\ndivided into six supergroups. Within each supergroup are multiple kingdoms. Although each supergroup is believed to be monophyletic, the\ndotted lines suggest evolutionary relationships among the supergroups that continue to be debated.\n23.3 \u2022 Groups of Protists\n583\nKeep in mind that the classification scheme presented here represents just one of several hypotheses, and the true evolutionary\nrelationships are still to be determined. The six supergroups may be modified or replaced by a more appropriate hierarchy as\ngenetic, morphological, and ecological data accumulate. When learning about protists, it is helpful to focus less on the\nnomenclature and more on the commonalities and differences that illustrate how each group has exploited the possibilities of\neukaryotic life.\nArchaeplastida\nMolecular evidence supports the hypothesis that all Archaeplastida are descendents of an endosymbiotic relationship between a\nheterotrophic protist and a cyanobacterium. The protist members of the group include the red algae and green algae. It was\nfrom a common ancestor of these protists that the land plants evolved, since their closest relatives are found in this group. The\nred and green algae include unicellular, multicellular, and colonial forms. A variety of algal life cycles exists, but the most\ncomplex is alternation of generations, in which both haploid and diploid stages are multicellular. A diploid sporophyte contains\ncells that undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores. The spores germinate and grow into a haploid gametophyte, which then\nmakes gametes by mitosis. The gametes fuse to form a zygote that grows into a diploid sporophyte. Alternation of generations is\nseen in some species of Archaeplastid algae, as well as some species of Stramenopiles (Figure 23.10). In some species, the\ngametophyte and sporophyte look quite different, while in others they are nearly indistinguishable.\nGlaucophytes\nGlaucophytes are a small group of Archaeplastida interesting because their chloroplasts retain remnants of the peptidoglycan\ncell wall of the ancestral cyanobacterial endosymbiont (Figure 23.10).\nFigure 23.10 Glaucocystis. (credit: By ja:User:NEON / commons:User:NEON_ja - Own work, CC BY-SA 2.5, https://commons.wikimedia.org/\nw/index.php?curid=1706641 (http://openstax.org/l/Glaucocystis) )\nRed Algae\nRed algae, or rhodophytes lack flagella, and are primarily multicellular, although they range in size from microscopic,\nunicellular protists to large, multicellular forms grouped into the informal seaweed category. Red algae have a second cell wall\noutside an inner cellulose cell wall. Carbohydrates in this wall are the source of agarose used for electrophoresis gels and agar for\nsolidifying bacterial media. The \"red\" in the red algae comes from phycoerythrins, accessory photopigments that are red in color\nand obscure the green tint of chlorophyll in some species. Other protists classified as red algae lack phycoerythrins and are\n584\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nparasites. Both the red algae and the glaucophytes store carbohydrates in the cytoplasm rather than in the plastid. Red algae are\ncommon in tropical waters where they have been detected at depths of 260 meters. Other red algae exist in terrestrial or\nfreshwater environments. The red algae life cycle is an unusual alternation of generations that includes two sporophyte phases,\nwith meiosis occurring only in the second sporophyte.\nGreen Algae: Chlorophytes and Charophytes\nThe most abundant group of algae is the green algae. The green algae exhibit features similar to those of the land plants,\nparticularly in terms of chloroplast structure. In both green algae and plants, carbohydrates are stored in the plastid. That this\ngroup of protists shared a relatively recent common ancestor with land plants is well supported. The green algae are subdivided\ninto the chlorophytes and the charophytes. The charophytes are the closest living relatives to land plants and resemble them in\nmorphology and reproductive strategies. The familiar Spirogyra is a charophyte. Charophytes are common in wet habitats, and\ntheir presence often signals a healthy ecosystem.\nThe chlorophytes exhibit great diversity of form and function. Chlorophytes primarily inhabit freshwater and damp soil, and are\na common component of plankton. Chlamydomonas is a simple, unicellular chlorophyte with a pear-shaped morphology and\ntwo opposing, anterior flagella that guide this protist toward light sensed by its eyespot. More complex chlorophyte species\nexhibit haploid gametes and spores that resemble Chlamydomonas.\nThe chlorophyte Volvox is one of only a few examples of a colonial organism, which behaves in some ways like a collection of\nindividual cells, but in other ways like the specialized cells of a multicellular organism (Figure 23.11). Volvox colonies contain 500\nto 60,000 cells, each with two flagella, contained within a hollow, spherical matrix composed of a gelatinous glycoprotein\nsecretion. Individual cells in a Volvox colony move in a coordinated fashion and are interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges. Only\na few of the cells reproduce to create daughter colonies, an example of basic cell specialization in this organism. Daughter\ncolonies are produced with their flagella on the inside and have to evert as they are released.\nFigure 23.11 Volvox. Volvox aureus is a green alga in the supergroup Archaeplastida. This species exists as a colony, consisting of cells\nimmersed in a gel-like matrix and intertwined with each other via hair-like cytoplasmic extensions.

In addition, some\nchlorophytes exist as large, multinucleate, single cells. Species in the genus Caulerpa exhibit flattened fern-like foliage and can\nreach lengths of 3 meters (Figure 23.12). Caulerpa species undergo nuclear division, but their cells do not complete cytokinesis,\nremaining instead as massive and elaborate single cells.\n23.3 \u2022 Groups of Protists\n585\nFigure 23.12 A multinucleate alga. Caulerpa taxifolia is a chlorophyte consisting of a single cell containing potentially thousands of nuclei.\n(credit: NOAA). An interesting question is how a single cell can produce such complex shapes.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTake a look at this video to see cytoplasmic streaming in a green alga.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/chara_corallina)\nAmoebozoa\nLike the Archaeplastida, the Amoebozoa include species with single cells, species with large multinucleated cells, and species\nthat have multicellular phases. Amoebozoan cells characteristically exhibit pseudopodia that extend like tubes or flat lobes.\nThese pseudopods project outward from anywhere on the cell surface and can anchor to a substrate. The protist then transports\nits cytoplasm into the pseudopod, thereby moving the entire cell. This type of motion is similar to the cytoplasmic streaming\nused to move organelles in the Archaeplastida, and is also used by other protists as a means of locomotion or as a method to\ndistribute nutrients and oxygen. The Amoebozoa include both free-living and parasitic species.\nGymnomoebae\nThe Gymnamoeba or lobose amoebae include both naked amoebae like the familiar Amoeba proteus and shelled amoebae,\nwhose bodies protrude like snails from their protective tests. Amoeba proteus is a large amoeba about 500 \u00b5m in diameter but is\ndwarfed by the multinucleate amoebae Pelomyxa, which can be 10 times its size. Although Pelomyxa may have hundreds of\nnuclei, it has lost its mitochondria, but replaced them with bacterial endosymbionts. The secondary loss or modification of\nmitochondria is a feature also seen in other protist groups.\nFigure 23.13 Amoeba. Amoebae with tubular and lobe-shaped pseudopodia are seen under a microscope. These isolates would be\nmorphologically classified as amoebozoans.\n586\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nSlime Molds\nA subset of the amoebozoans, the slime molds, has several morphological similarities to fungi that are thought to be the result of\nconvergent evolution. For instance, during times of stress, some slime molds develop into spore-generating fruiting bodies,\nmuch like fungi.\nThe slime molds are categorized on the basis of their life cycles into plasmodial or cellular types. Plasmodial slime molds are\ncomposed of large, multinucleate cells and move along surfaces like an amorphous blob of slime during their feeding stage\n(Figure 23.14). Food particles are lifted and engulfed into the slime mold as it glides along. The \"dog vomit\" slime mold seen in\nFigure 23.14 is a particularly colorful specimen and its ability to creep about might well trigger suspicion of alien invasion. Upon\nmaturation, the plasmodium takes on a net-like appearance with the ability to form fruiting bodies, or sporangia, during times\nof stress. Haploid spores are produced by meiosis within the sporangia, and spores can be disseminated through the air or\nwater to potentially land in more favorable environments. If this occurs, the spores germinate to form ameboid or flagellate\nhaploid cells that can combine with each other and produce a diploid zygotic slime mold to complete the life cycle.\nFigure 23.14 Plasmodial slime molds. The life cycle of the plasmodial slime mold is shown. The brightly colored plasmodium in the inset\nphoto is a single-celled, multinucleate mass. (credit: modification of work by Dr. Jonatha Gott and the Center for RNA Molecular Biology,\nCase Western Reserve University)\nThe cellular slime molds function as independent amoeboid cells when nutrients are abundant. When food is depleted, cellular\nslime molds aggregate into a mass of cells that behaves as a single unit, called a slug. Some cells in the slug contribute to a\n2\u20133-millimeter stalk, drying up and dying in the process. Cells atop the stalk form an asexual fruiting body that contains\nhaploid spores (Figure 23.15). As with plasmodial slime molds, the spores are disseminated and can germinate if they land in a\nmoist environment. One representative genus of the cellular slime molds is Dictyostelium, which commonly exists in the damp\n23.3 \u2022 Groups of Protists\n587\nsoil of forests.\nFigure 23.15 Cellular Slime Mold. The image shows several stages in the life cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum, including aggregated cells,\nmobile slugs and their transformation into fruiting bodies with a cluster of spores supported by a stalk.

The flagella of other protists\nare anterior and their movement pulls the cells along, while the opisthokonts are pushed. Protist members of the opisthokonts\ninclude the animal-like choanoflagellates, which are believed to resemble the common ancestor of sponges and perhaps, all\nanimals. Choanoflagellates include unicellular and colonial forms (Figure 23.16), and number about 244 described species. In\nthese organisms, the single, apical flagellum is surrounded by a contractile collar composed of microvilli. The collar is used to\nfilter and collect bacteria for ingestion by the protist. A similar feeding mechanism is seen in the collar cells of sponges, which\nsuggests a possible connection between choanoflagellates and animals.\nThe Mesomycetozoa form a small group of parasites, primarily of fish, and at least one form that can parasitize humans. Their\nlife cycles are poorly understood. These organisms are of special interest, because they appear to be so closely related to animals.\nIn the past, they were grouped with fungi and other protists based on their morphology.\n588\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 23.16 A Colonial Choanoflagellate.

The next three supergroups all contain at least some photosynthetic members whose chloroplasts were derived by\nsecondary endosymbiosis. They also show some interesting variations in nuclear structure, and modification of mitochondria or\nchloroplasts.\nRhizaria\nThe Rhizaria supergroup includes many of the amoebas with thin threadlike, needle-like or root-like pseudopodia (Figure 23.17),\nrather than the broader lobed pseudopodia of the Amoebozoa. Many rhizarians make elaborate and beautiful tests\u2014armor-like\ncoverings for the body of the cell\u2014composed of calcium carbonate, silicon, or strontium salts. Rhizarians have important roles\nin both carbon and nitrogen cycles. When rhizarians die, and their tests sink into deep water, the carbonates are out of reach of\nmost decomposers, locking carbon dioxide away from the atmosphere. In general, this process by which carbon is transported\ndeep into the ocean is described as the biological carbon pump, because carbon is \u201cpumped\u201d to the ocean depths where it is\ninaccessible to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The biological carbon pump is a crucial component of the carbon cycle that\nmaintains lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Foraminiferans are unusual in that they are the only eukaryotes known to\nparticipate in the nitrogen cycle by denitrification, an activity usually served only by prokaryotes.\nFigure 23.17 Rhizaria. Ammonia tepida, a Rhizaria species viewed here using phase contrast light microscopy, exhibits many threadlike\n23.3 \u2022 Groups of Protists\n589\npseudopodia. It also has a chambered calcium carbonate shell or test. (credit: modification of work by Scott Fay, UC Berkeley; scale-bar\ndata from Matt Russell)\nForaminiferans\nForaminiferans, or forams, are unicellular heterotrophic protists, ranging from approximately 20 micrometers to several\ncentimeters in length, and occasionally resembling tiny snails (Figure 23.18). As a group, the forams exhibit porous shells, called\ntests that are built from various organic materials and typically hardened with calcium carbonate. The tests may house\nphotosynthetic algae, which the forams can harvest for nutrition. Foram pseudopodia extend through the pores and allow the\nforams to move, feed, and gather additional building materials. Typically, forams are associated with sand or other particles in\nmarine or freshwater habitats. Foraminiferans are also useful as indicators of pollution and changes in global weather patterns.\nFigure 23.18 Foraminiferan Tests. These shells from foraminifera sank to the sea floor. (credit: Deep East 2001, NOAA/OER)\nRadiolarians\nA second subtype of Rhizaria, the radiolarians, exhibit intricate exteriors of glassy silica with radial or bilateral symmetry\n(Figure 23.19). Needle-like pseudopods supported by microtubules radiate outward from the cell bodies of these protists and\nfunction to catch food particles. The shells of dead radiolarians sink to the ocean floor, where they may accumulate in 100 meter-\nthick depths. Preserved, sedimented radiolarians are very common in the fossil record.\nFigure 23.19 Radiolarian shell. This fossilized radiolarian shell was imaged using a scanning electron microscope.

The\nChlorarachniophytes (Figure 23.20) are photosynthetic, having acquired chloroplasts by secondary endosymbiosis. The\n590\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nchloroplast contains a remnant of the chlorophyte endosymbiont nucleus, sandwiched between the two sets of chloroplast\nmembranes. Vampyrellids or \"vampire amoebae,\" as their name suggests, obtain their nutrients by thrusting a pseudopod into\nthe interior of other cells and sucking out their contents.\nFigure 23.20 A Chlorarachniophyte. This rhizarian is mixotrophic, and can obtain nutrients both by photosynthesis and by trapping various\nmicroorganisms with its network of pseudopodia.

Therefore, the ancestor of chromalveolates is believed to have resulted from a secondary\nendosymbiotic event. However, some chromalveolates appear to have lost red alga-derived plastid organelles or lack plastid\ngenes altogether. Therefore, this supergroup should be considered a hypothesis-based working group that is subject to change.\nChromalveolates include very important photosynthetic organisms, such as diatoms, brown algae, and significant disease\nagents in animals and plants. The chromalveolates can be subdivided into alveolates and stramenopiles.\nAlveolates: Dinoflagellates, Apicomplexians, and Ciliates\nA large body of data supports that the alveolates are derived from a shared common ancestor. The alveolates are named for the\npresence of an alveolus, or membrane-enclosed sac, beneath the cell membrane. The exact function of the alveolus is unknown,\nbut it may be involved in osmoregulation. The alveolates are further categorized into some of the better-known protists: the\ndinoflagellates, the apicomplexans, and the ciliates.\nDinoflagellates exhibit extensive morphological diversity and can be photosynthetic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic. The\nchloroplast of photosynthetic dinoflagellates was derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga. Many dinoflagellates are\nencased in interlocking plates of cellulose. Two perpendicular flagella fit into the grooves between the cellulose plates, with one\nflagellum extending longitudinally and a second encircling the dinoflagellate (Figure 23.21). Together, the flagella contribute to\nthe characteristic spinning motion of dinoflagellates. These protists exist in freshwater and marine habitats, and are a\ncomponent of plankton, the typically microscopic organisms that drift through the water and serve as a crucial food source for\nlarger aquatic organisms.\n23.3 \u2022 Groups of Protists\n591\nFigure 23.21 Dinoflagellates. The dinoflagellates exhibit great diversity in shape. Many are encased in cellulose armor and have two flagella\nthat fit in grooves between the plates. Movement of these two perpendicular flagella causes a spinning motion.\nDinoflagellates have a nuclear variant called a dinokaryon. The chromosomes in the dinokaryon are highly condensed\nthroughout the cell cycle and do not have typical histones. Mitosis in dinoflagellates is closed, that is, the spindle separates the\nchromosomes from outside of the nucleus without breakdown of the nuclear envelope.\nSome dinoflagellates generate light, called bioluminescence, when they are jarred or stressed. Large numbers of marine\ndinoflagellates (billions or trillions of cells per wave) can emit light and cause an entire breaking wave to twinkle or take on a\nbrilliant blue color (Figure 23.22). For approximately 20 species of marine dinoflagellates, population explosions (also called\nblooms) during the summer months can tint the ocean with a muddy red color. This phenomenon is called a red tide, and it\nresults from the abundant red pigments present in dinoflagellate plastids. In large quantities, these dinoflagellate species\nsecrete an asphyxiating toxin that can kill fish, birds, and marine mammals. Red tides can be massively detrimental to\ncommercial fisheries, and humans who consume these protists may become poisoned.\nFigure 23.22 Dinoflagellate bioluminescence. Bioluminescence is emitted from dinoflagellates in a breaking wave, as seen from the New\nJersey coast. (credit: \u201ccatalano82\u201d/Flickr)\nThe apicomplexan protists are named for a structure called an apical complex (Figure 23.23), which appears to be a highly\nmodified secondary chloroplast. The apicoplast genome is similar to those of dinoflagellate chloroplasts. The apical complex is\nspecialized for entry and infection of host cells. Indeed, all apicomplexans are parasitic. This group includes the genus\nPlasmodium, which causes malaria in humans. Apicomplexan life cycles are complex, involving multiple hosts and stages of\nsexual and asexual reproduction.\n592\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 23.23 Apicomplexa. (a) Apicomplexans are parasitic protists. They have a characteristic apical complex that enables them to infect\nhost cells. (b) Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has a complex life cycle typical of apicomplexans. (credit b: modification of work\nby CDC)\nThe ciliates, which include Paramecium and Tetrahymena, are a group of protists 10 to 3,000 micrometers in length that are\ncovered in rows, tufts, or spirals of tiny cilia. By beating their cilia synchronously or in waves, ciliates can coordinate directed\nmovements and ingest food particles. Certain ciliates have fused cilia-based structures that function like paddles, funnels, or\nfins. Ciliates also are surrounded by a pellicle, providing protection without compromising agility. The genus Paramecium\nincludes protists that have organized their cilia into a plate-like primitive mouth, called an oral groove, which is used to capture\nand digest bacteria (Figure 23.24). Food captured in the oral groove enters a food vacuole, where it combines with digestive\nenzymes. Waste particles are expelled by an exocytic vesicle that fuses at a specific region on the cell membrane, called the anal\npore. In addition to a vacuole-based digestive system, Paramecium also uses contractile vacuoles, which are osmoregulatory\nvesicles that fill with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contract to squeeze water from the cell. Ciliates therefore\nexhibit considerable structural complexity without having achieved multicellularity.\nFigure 23.24 Paramecium. Paramecium has a primitive mouth (called an oral groove) to ingest food, and an anal pore to eliminate waste.\nContractile vacuoles allow the organism to excrete excess water. Cilia enable the organism to move.

The micronucleus is essential for sexual\nreproduction, and is in many ways a typical eukaryotic nucleus, except that its genes are not transcribed. The transcribed\nnucleus is the macronucleus, which directs asexual binary fission and all other biological functions. The macronucleus is a\n23.3 \u2022 Groups of Protists\n593\nmultiploid nucleus constructed from the micronucleus during sexual reproduction. Periodic reconstruction of the\nmacronucleus is necessary because the macronucleus divides amitotically, and thus becomes genetically unbalanced over a\nperiod of successive cell replications. Paramecium and most other ciliates reproduce sexually by conjugation. This process\nbegins when two different mating types of Paramecium make physical contact and join with a cytoplasmic bridge (Figure 23.25).\nThe diploid micronucleus in each cell then undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid micronuclei. Three of these degenerate in\neach cell, leaving one micronucleus that then undergoes mitosis, generating two haploid micronuclei. The cells each exchange\none of these haploid nuclei and move away from each other. Fusion of the haploid micronuclei generates a completely novel\ndiploid pre-micronucleus in each conjugative cell. This pre-micronucleus undergoes three rounds of mitosis to produce eight\ncopies, and the original macronucleus disintegrates. Four of the eight pre-micronuclei become full-fledged micronuclei,\nwhereas the other four perform multiple rounds of DNA replication. The copies of the micronuclear chromosomes are severely\nedited to form hundreds of smaller chromosomes that contain only the protein coding genes. Each of these smaller\nchromosomes gets new telomeres as the macronucleus differentiates. Two cycles of cell division then yield four new Paramecia\nfrom each original conjugative cell.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 23.25 Conjugation in Paramecium. The complex process of sexual reproduction in Paramecium creates eight daughter cells from\ntwo original cells. Each cell has a macronucleus and a micronucleus. During sexual reproduction, the macronucleus dissolves and is\n594\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nreplaced by a micronucleus.

The identifying feature of this group is the presence of a textured, or\n\u201chairy,\u201d flagellum. Many stramenopiles also have an additional flagellum that lacks hair-like projections (Figure 23.26). Members\nof this subgroup range in size from single-celled diatoms to the massive and multicellular kelp.\nFigure 23.26 Stramenopile flagella. This stramenopile cell has a single hairy flagellum and a secondary smooth flagellum.\nThe diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic protists that encase themselves in intricately patterned, glassy cell walls composed of\nsilicon dioxide in a matrix of organic particles (Figure 23.27). These protists are a component of freshwater and marine\nplankton. Most species of diatoms reproduce asexually, although some instances of sexual reproduction and sporulation also\nexist. Some diatoms exhibit a slit in their silica shell, called a raphe. By expelling a stream of mucopolysaccharides from the\nraphe, the diatom can attach to surfaces or propel itself in one direction.\n23.3 \u2022 Groups of Protists\n595\nFigure 23.27 Diatoms. Assorted diatoms, visualized here using light microscopy, live among annual sea ice in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.\nDiatoms range in size from 2 to 200 \u00b5m. (credit: Prof. Gordon T. Taylor, Stony Brook University, NSF, NOAA)\nDuring periods of nutrient availability, diatom populations bloom to numbers greater than can be consumed by aquatic\norganisms. The excess diatoms die and sink to the sea floor where they are not easily reached by saprobes that feed on dead\norganisms. As a result, the carbon dioxide that the diatoms had consumed and incorporated into their cells during\nphotosynthesis is not returned to the atmosphere. Along with rhizarians and other shelled protists, diatoms help to maintain a\nbalanced carbon cycle.\nLike diatoms, golden algae are largely unicellular, although some species can form large colonies. Their characteristic gold color\nresults from their extensive use of carotenoids, a group of photosynthetic pigments that are generally yellow or orange in color.\nGolden algae are found in both freshwater and marine environments, where they form a major part of the plankton community.\nThe brown algae are primarily marine, multicellular organisms that are known colloquially as seaweeds. Giant kelps are a type of\nbrown alga. Some brown algae have evolved specialized tissues that resemble terrestrial plants, with root-like holdfasts, stem-\nlike stipes, and leaf-like blades that are capable of photosynthesis. The stipes of giant kelps are enormous, extending in some\ncases for 60 meters. Like the green algae, brown algae have a variety of life cycles, including alternation of generations. In the\nbrown algae genus Laminaria, haploid spores develop into multicellular gametophytes, which produce haploid gametes that\ncombine to produce diploid organisms that then become multicellular organisms with a different structure from the haploid\nform (Figure 23.28).\n596\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 23.28 Alternation of generations in a brown alga. Several species of brown algae, such as the Laminaria shown here, have evolved\nlife cycles in which both the haploid (gametophyte) and diploid (sporophyte) forms are multicellular. The gametophyte is different in\nstructure than the sporophyte.

The oomycetes are characterized by a cellulose-based cell wall and an\nextensive network of filaments that allow for nutrient uptake. As diploid spores, many oomycetes have two oppositely directed\nflagella (one hairy and one smooth) for locomotion. The oomycetes are nonphotosynthetic and include many saprobes and\nparasites. The saprobes appear as white fluffy growths on dead organisms (Figure 23.29). Most oomycetes are aquatic, but some\nparasitize terrestrial plants. One plant pathogen is Phytophthora infestans, the causative agent of late blight of potatoes, such as\noccurred in the nineteenth century Irish potato famine.\n23.3 \u2022 Groups of Protists\n597\nFigure 23.29 Oomycetes.

(credit: modification of work by Thomas Bresson)\nExcavata\nMany of the protist species classified into the supergroup Excavata are asymmetrical, single-celled organisms with a feeding\ngroove \u201cexcavated\u201d from one side. This supergroup includes heterotrophic predators, photosynthetic species, and parasites. Its\nsubgroups are the diplomonads, parabasalids, and euglenozoans. The group includes a variety of modified mitochondria, as\nwell as chloroplasts derived from green algae by secondary endosymbiosis. Many of the euglenozoans are free-living, but most\ndiplomonads and parabasalids are symbionts or parasites.\nDiplomonads\nAmong the Excavata are the diplomonads, which include the intestinal parasite, Giardia lamblia (Figure 23.30). Until recently,\nthese protists were believed to lack mitochondria. Mitochondrial remnant organelles, called mitosomes, have since been\nidentified in diplomonads, but although these mitosomes are essentially nonfunctional as respiratory organelles, they do\nfunction in iron and sulfur metabolism. Diplomonads exist in anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways, such as\nglycolysis, to generate energy. Each diplomonad cell has two similar, but not identical haploid nuclei. Diplomonads have four\npairs of locomotor flagella that are fairly deeply rooted in basal bodies that lie between the two nuclei.\nFigure 23.30 Giardia. The mammalian intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia, visualized here using scanning electron microscopy, is a\nwaterborne protist that causes severe diarrhea when ingested.

Other cytoskeletal features include an axostyle, a bundle of fibers that runs the length of the\ncell and may even extend beyond it. Parabasalids move with flagella and membrane rippling, and these and other cytoskeletal\nmodifications may assist locomotion. Like the diplomonads, the parabasalids exhibit modified mitochondria. In parabasalids\nthese structures function anaerobically and are called hydrogenosomes because they produce hydrogen gas as a byproduct.\nThe parabasalid Trichomonas vaginalis causes trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease in humans, which appears in an\nestimated 180 million cases worldwide each year. Whereas men rarely exhibit symptoms during an infection with this protist,\ninfected women may become more susceptible to secondary infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and may be\nmore likely to develop cervical cancer. Pregnant women infected with T. vaginalis are at an increased risk of serious\ncomplications, such as pre-term delivery.\nSome of the most complex of the parabasalids are those that colonize the rumen of ruminant animals and the guts of termites.\nThese organisms can digest cellulose, a metabolic talent that is unusual among eukaryotic cells. They have multiple flagella\narranged in complex patterns and some additionally recruit spirochetes that attach to their surface to act as accessory locomotor\nstructures.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTermite gut endosymbionts\nClick to view content (https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOx7SDdIqyU)\nEuglenozoans\nEuglenozoans includes parasites, heterotrophs, autotrophs, and mixotrophs, ranging in size from 10 to 500 \u00b5m. Euglenoids\nmove through their aquatic habitats using two long flagella that guide them toward light sources sensed by a primitive ocular\norgan called an eyespot. The familiar genus, Euglena, encompasses some mixotrophic species that display a photosynthetic\ncapability only when light is present. The chloroplast of Euglena descends from a green alga by secondary endosymbiosis. In the\ndark, the chloroplasts of Euglena shrink up and temporarily cease functioning, and the cells instead take up organic nutrients\nfrom their environment. Euglena has a tough pellicle composed of bands of protein attached to the cytoskeleton. The bands\nspiral around the cell and give Euglena its exceptional flexibility.\nThe human parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, belongs to a different subgroup of Euglenozoa, the kinetoplastids. The kinetoplastid\nsubgroup is named after the kinetoplast, a large modified mitochondrion carrying multiple circular DNAs. This subgroup\nincludes several parasites, collectively called trypanosomes, which cause devastating human diseases and infect an insect\nspecies during a portion of their life cycle. T. brucei develops in the gut of the tsetse fly after the fly bites an infected human or\nother mammalian host. The parasite then travels to the insect salivary glands to be transmitted to another human or other\nmammal when the infected tsetse fly consumes another blood meal. T. brucei is common in central Africa and is the causative\nagent of African sleeping sickness, a disease associated with severe chronic fatigue, coma, and can be fatal if left untreated since\nit leads to progressive decline of the function of the central nervous system.\n23.3 \u2022 Groups of Protists\n599\nFigure 23.31 Sleeping sickness.

Whereas some protist species are essential components of the food chain and\ngenerators of biomass, others function in the decomposition of organic materials. Still other protists are dangerous human\npathogens or causative agents of devastating plant diseases.\nPrimary Producers/Food Sources\nProtists are essential sources of food and provide nutrition for many other organisms. In some cases, as with zooplankton,\nprotists are consumed directly. Alternatively, photosynthetic protists serve as producers of nutrition for other organisms.\nParamecium bursaria and several other species of ciliates are mixotrophic due to a symbiotic relationship with green algae. This\nis a temporary version of the secondarily endosymbiotic chloroplast found in Euglena. But these symbiotic associations are not\nrestricted to protists. For instance, photosynthetic dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae provide nutrients for the coral polyps\n(Figure 23.32) that house them, giving corals a boost of energy to secrete their calcium carbonate skeleton. In turn, the corals\nprovide the protist with a protected environment and the compounds needed for photosynthesis. This type of symbiotic\nrelationship is important in nutrient-poor environments. Without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a\nprocess called coral bleaching, and they eventually die. This explains why reef-building corals typically do not reside in waters\ndeeper than 20 meters: insufficient light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates to photosynthesize.\n600\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 23.32 Coral with symbiotic dinoflagellates. Coral polyps obtain nutrition through a symbiotic relationship with dinoflagellates.\nThe protists and their products of photosynthesis are essential\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014to the survival of organisms ranging\nfrom bacteria to mammals (Figure 23.33). As primary producers, protists feed a large proportion of the world\u2019s aquatic species.\n(On land, terrestrial plants serve as primary producers.) In fact, approximately 25 percent of the world\u2019s photosynthesis is\nconducted by photosynthetic protists, particularly dinoflagellates, diatoms, and multicellular algae.\nFigure 23.33 Protists contribute to the food chain. Virtually all aquatic organisms depend directly or indirectly on protists for food.

Recall that certain anaerobic parabasalid species exist in the\ndigestive tracts of termites and wood-eating cockroaches, where they contribute an essential step in the digestion of cellulose\ningested by these insects as they consume wood.\n23.4 \u2022 Ecology of Protists\n601\nHuman Pathogens\nAs we have seen, a pathogen is anything that causes disease. Parasitic organisms live in or on a host organism and harm the\norganism. A small number of protists are serious pathogenic parasites that must infect other organisms to survive and\npropagate. For example, protist parasites include the causative agents of malaria, African sleeping sickness, amoebic\nencephalitis, and waterborne gastroenteritis in humans. Other protist pathogens prey on plants, effecting massive destruction\nof food crops.\nPlasmodium Species\nIn 2015 WHO reported over 200 million cases of malaria, mostly in Africa, South America, and southern Asia. However, it is not\nwell known that malaria was also a prevalent and debilitating disease of the North Central region of the United States,\nparticularly Michigan, with its thousands of lakes and numerous swamps. Prior to the civil war, and the drainage of many\nswamps, virtually everyone who immigrated to Michigan picked up malaria (ague as it was called in the late 1800s), and the pale,\nsallow, bloated faces of that period were the rule. The only healthy faces were worn by those immigrants who had just arrived. In\nfact, there were more deaths due to malaria in Michigan than those from the Civil War.\nWe now know that malaria is caused by several species of the apicomplexan protist genus Plasmodium. Members of\nPlasmodium must sequentially require both a mosquito and a vertebrate to complete their life cycle. In vertebrates, the parasite\ndevelops in liver cells (the exoerythrocytic stage) and goes on to infect red blood cells (the erythrocytic stage), bursting from and\ndestroying the blood cells with each asexual replication cycle (Figure 23.34). Of the four Plasmodium species known to infect\nhumans, P. falciparum accounts for 50 percent of all malaria cases and is the primary (and deadliest) cause of disease-related\nfatalities in tropical regions of the world. In 2015, it was estimated that malaria caused over 400,000 deaths, mostly in African\nchildren. During the course of malaria, P. falciparum can infect and destroy more than one-half of a human\u2019s circulating blood\ncells, leading to severe anemia. In response to waste products released as the parasites burst from infected blood cells, the host\nimmune system mounts a massive inflammatory response with episodes of delirium-inducing fever (paroxysms) as parasites\nlyse red blood cells, spilling parasite waste into the bloodstream. P. falciparum is transmitted to humans by the African\nmosquito, Anopheles gambiae. Techniques to kill, sterilize, or avoid exposure to this highly aggressive mosquito species are\ncrucial to malaria control. Ironically, a type of genetic control has arisen in parts of the world where malaria is endemic.\nPossession of one copy of the HbS beta globin allele results in malaria resistance. Unfortunately, this allele also has an\nunfortunate second effect; when homozygous it causes sickle cell disease.\nFigure 23.34 Malaria parasite. Red blood cells are shown to be infected with P. falciparum, the causative agent of malaria.

This trypanosome confounds the human immune system by changing its thick layer of surface glycoproteins with each\ninfectious cycle. (The glycoproteins are identified by the immune system as foreign antigens, and a specific antibody defense is\nmounted against the parasite.) However, T. brucei has thousands of possible antigens, and with each subsequent generation,\nthe protist switches to a glycoprotein coating with a different molecular structure. In this way, T. brucei is capable of replicating\ncontinuously without the immune system ever succeeding in clearing the parasite. Without treatment, T. brucei attacks red\nblood cells, causing the patient to lapse into a coma and eventually die. During epidemic periods, mortality from the disease can\nbe high. Greater surveillance and control measures lead to a reduction in reported cases; some of the lowest numbers reported\nin 50 years (fewer than 10,000 cases in all of sub-Saharan Africa) have happened since 2009.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis movie (http://openstax.org/l/African_sleep) discusses the pathogenesis of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of\nAfrican sleeping sickness.\nIn Latin America, another species of trypanosome, T. cruzi, is responsible for Chagas disease. T. cruzi infections are mainly\ncaused by a blood-sucking \u201ckissing bug\u201d in the genus Triatoma. These \u201ctrue bugs\u201d bite the host during the night and then\ndefecate on the wound, transmitting the trypanosome to the victim. The victim scratches the wound, further inoculating the\nsite with trypanosomes at the location of the bite. After about 10 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase but most never\ndevelop further symptoms. In about 30 percent of cases, however, the trypanosome causes further damage, especially to the\nheart and digestive system tissues in the chronic phase of infection, leading to malnutrition and heart failure due to abnormal\nheart rhythms. An estimated 10 million people are infected with Chagas disease, and it caused 10,000 deaths in 2008.\nFigure 23.35 Trypanosomes. Trypanosomes are shown among red blood cells. (credit: modification of work by Dr. Myron G. Shultz; scale-\nbar data from Matt Russell)\nPlant Parasites\nProtist parasites of terrestrial plants include agents that destroy food crops. The oomycete Plasmopara viticola parasitizes grape\nplants, causing a disease called downy mildew (Figure 23.36). Grape plants infected with P. viticola appear stunted and have\ndiscolored, withered leaves. The spread of downy mildew nearly collapsed the French wine industry in the nineteenth century.\n23.4 \u2022 Ecology of Protists\n603\nFigure 23.36 Protist plant infections. Both downy and powdery mildews on this grape leaf are caused by an infection of P. viticola. (credit:\nmodification of work by USDA)\nPhytophthora infestans is an oomycete responsible for potato late blight, which causes potato stalks and stems to decay into\nblack slime (Figure 23.37). Widespread potato blight caused by P. infestans precipitated the well-known Irish potato famine in\nthe nineteenth century that claimed the lives of approximately 1 million people and led to the emigration of at least 1 million\nmore from Ireland. Late blight continues to plague potato crops in certain parts of the United States and Russia, wiping out as\nmuch as 70 percent of crops when no pesticides are applied.\nFigure 23.37 Potato blight. These unappetizing remnants result from an infection with P. infestans, the causative agent of potato late\nblight. (credit: USDA)\nProtist Decomposers\nThe fungus-like protist saprobes are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter, such as dead organisms or\ntheir wastes. For instance, many types of oomycetes grow on dead animals or algae. Saprobic protists have the essential function\nof returning inorganic nutrients to the soil and water. This process allows for new plant growth, which in turn generates\nsustenance for other organisms along the food chain. Indeed, without saprobe species, such as protists, fungi, and bacteria, life\nwould cease to exist as all organic carbon became \u201ctied up\u201d in dead organisms.\n604\nChapter 23 \u2022 Protists\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nbiological carbon pump\nprocess by which inorganic carbon\nis fixed by photosynthetic species that then die and fall to\nthe sea floor where they cannot be reached by saprobes\nand their carbon dioxide consumption cannot be\nreturned to the atmosphere\nbioluminescence\ngeneration and emission of light by an\norganism, as in dinoflagellates\ncontractile vacuole\nvesicle that fills with water (as it enters\nthe cell by osmosis) and then contracts to squeeze water\nfrom the cell; an osmoregulatory vesicle\ncytoplasmic streaming\nmovement of cytoplasm into an\nextended pseudopod such that the entire cell is\ntransported to the site of the pseudopod\nendosymbiosis\nengulfment of one cell within another such\nthat the engulfed cell survives, and both cells benefit; the\nprocess responsible for the evolution of mitochondria and\nchloroplasts in eukaryotes\nendosymbiotic theory\ntheory that states that eukaryotes\nmay have been a product of one cell engulfing another,\none living within another, and evolving over time until\nthe separate cells were no longer recognizable as such\nhydrogenosome\norganelle carried by parabasalids\n(Excavata) that functions anaerobically and outputs\nhydrogen gas as a byproduct; likely evolved from\nmitochondria\nkinetoplast\nmass of DNA carried within the single,\noversized mitochondrion, characteristic of kinetoplastids\n(phylum: Euglenozoa)\nmitosome\nnonfunctional organelle carried in the cells of\ndiplomonads (Excavata) that likely evolved from a\nmitochondrion\nmixotroph\norganism that can obtain nutrition by\nautotrophic or heterotrophic means, usually facultatively\npellicle\nouter cell covering composed of interlocking\nprotein strips that function like a flexible coat of armor,\npreventing cells from being torn or pierced without\ncompromising their range of motion\nphagolysosome\ncellular body formed by the union of a\nphagosome containing the ingested particle with a\nlysosome that contains hydrolytic enzymes\nplankton\ndiverse group of mostly microscopic organisms\nthat drift in marine and freshwater systems and serve as\na food source for larger aquatic organisms\nplastid\none of a group of related organelles in plant cells\nthat are involved in the storage of starches, fats, proteins,\nand pigments\nraphe\nslit in the silica shell of diatoms through which the\nprotist secretes a stream of mucopolysaccharides for\nlocomotion and attachment to substrates\ntest\nporous shell of a foram that is built from various\norganic materials and typically hardened with calcium\ncarbonate\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n23.1 Eukaryotic Origins\nThe oldest fossil evidence of eukaryotes is about 2 billion\nyears old. Fossils older than this all appear to be prokaryotes.\nIt is probable that today\u2019s eukaryotes are descended from an\nancestor that had a prokaryotic organization. The last\ncommon ancestor of today\u2019s Eukarya had several\ncharacteristics, including cells with nuclei and an\nendomembrane system (which includes the nuclear\nenvelope). Its chromosomes were linear and contained DNA\nassociated with histones. The nuclear genome seems to be\ndescended from an archaean ancestor. This ancestor would\nhave had a cytoskeleton and divided its chromosomes\nmitotically.\nThe ancestral cytoskeletal system included the ability to\nmake cilia/flagella during at least part of its life cycle. It was\naerobic because it had mitochondria derived from an aerobic\nalpha-proteobacterium that lived inside a host cell. Whether\nthis host had a nucleus at the time of the initial symbiosis\nremains unknown. The last common ancestor may have had\na cell wall for at least part of its life cycle, but more data are\nneeded to confirm this hypothesis. Today\u2019s eukaryotes are\nvery diverse in their shapes, organization, life cycles, and\nnumber of cells per individual.\n23.2 Characteristics of Protists\nProtists are extremely diverse in terms of their biological and\necological characteristics, partly because they are an artificial\nassemblage of phylogenetically unrelated groups. Protists\ndisplay highly varied cell structures, several types of\nreproductive strategies, virtually every possible type of\nnutrition, and varied habitats. Most single-celled protists are\nmotile, but these organisms use diverse structures for\ntransportation.\n23.3 Groups of Protists\nThe process of classifying protists into meaningful groups is\nongoing, but genetic data in the past 20 years have clarified\nmany relationships that were previously unclear or\nmistaken. The majority view at present is to order all\neukaryotes into six supergroups: Archaeplastida,\nAmoebozoa, Opisthokonta, Rhizaria, Chromalveolata, and\nExcavata. The goal of this classification scheme is to create\nclusters of species that all are derived from a common\nancestor. At present, the monophyly of some of the\nsupergroups are better supported by genetic data than\nChapter 23 \u2022 Key Terms\n605\nothers. Although tremendous variation exists within the\nsupergroups, commonalities at the morphological,\nphysiological, and ecological levels can be identified.\n23.4 Ecology of Protists\nProtists function at several levels of the ecological food web:\nas primary producers, as direct food sources, and as\ndecomposers.

Indeed, the familiar\nmushroom is a reproductive structure used by many types of fungi. However, there are also many fungus\nspecies that don't produce mushrooms at all. Being eukaryotes, a typical fungal cell contains a true\nnucleus and many membrane-bound organelles. The kingdom Fungi includes an enormous variety of\nliving organisms collectively referred to as Eumycota, or true Fungi. While scientists have identified\nabout 100,000 species of fungi, this is only a fraction of the 1.5 million species of fungus likely present on\nEarth. Edible mushrooms, yeasts, black mold, and the producer of the antibiotic penicillin, Penicillium\nnotatum, are all members of the kingdom Fungi, which belongs to the domain Eukarya.\nChapter Outline\n24.1 Characteristics of\nFungi\n24.2 Classifications of\nFungi\n24.3 Ecology of Fungi\n24.4 Fungal Parasites\nand Pathogens\n24.5 Importance of\nFungi in Human Life\n24.1 Characteristics of Fungi\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nList the characteristics of fungi\n\u2022\nDescribe the composition of the mycelium\n\u2022\nDescribe the mode of nutrition of fungi\n\u2022\nExplain sexual and asexual reproduction in fungi\nFungi, once considered plant-like organisms, are more closely related to animals than plants. Fungi are not\ncapable of photosynthesis: they are heterotrophic because they use complex organic compounds as sources\nof energy and carbon. Fungi share a few other traits with animals. Their cell walls are composed of chitin,\nwhich is found in the exoskeletons of arthropods. Fungi produce a number of pigments, including\nmelanin,also found in the hair and skin of animals. Like animals, fungi also store carbohydrates as glycogen.\nHowever, like bacteria, fungi absorb nutrients across the cell surface and act as decomposers, helping to\nrecycle nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules.\nSome fungal organisms multiply only asexually, whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and\nsexual reproduction with alternation of generations. Most fungi produce a large number of spores, which\nare haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular, haploid individuals.\nFungi often interact with other organisms, forming beneficial or mutualistic associations. For example,\nmost terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi. The roots of the plant connect with the\nunderground parts of the fungus, which form mycorrhizae. Through mycorrhizae, the fungus and plant\nexchange nutrients and water, greatly aiding the survival of both species. Alternatively, lichens are an\nassociation between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner (usually an alga).\nFungi also cause serious infections in plants and animals. For example, Dutch elm disease, which is caused\nby the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi, is a particularly devastating type of fungal infestation that destroys many\nnative species of elm (Ulmus sp.) by infecting the tree\u2019s vascular system. The elm bark beetle acts as a vector,\ntransmitting the disease from tree to tree. Accidentally introduced in the 1900s, the fungus decimated elm\ntrees across the continent. Many European and Asiatic elms are less susceptible to Dutch elm disease than\nAmerican elms.\nIn humans, fungal infections are generally considered challenging to treat. Unlike bacteria, fungi do not\nrespond to traditional antibiotic therapy, since they are eukaryotes. Fungal infections may prove deadly for\nindividuals with compromised immune systems.\nFungi have many commercial applications. The food industry uses yeasts in baking, brewing, and cheese and\nwine making. Many industrial compounds are byproducts of fungal fermentation. Fungi are the source of\nmany commercial enzymes and antibiotics.\nAlthough humans have used yeasts and mushrooms since prehistoric times, until recently, the biology of\nfungi was poorly understood. In fact, up until the mid-20th century, many scientists classified fungi as\nplants! Fungi, like plants, are mostly sessile and seemingly rooted in place. They possess a stem-like\nstructure similar to plants, as well as having a root-like fungal mycelium in the soil. In addition, their mode\nof nutrition was poorly understood. Progress in the field of fungal biology was the result of mycology: the\nscientific study of fungi. Based on fossil evidence, fungi appeared in the pre-Cambrian era, about 450\nmillion years ago. Molecular biology analysis of the fungal genome demonstrates that fungi are more closely\nrelated to animals than plants. Under some current systematic phylogenies, they continue to be a\npolyphyletic group of organisms that share characteristics, rather than sharing a single common ancestor.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nMycologist\nMycologists are biologists who study fungi. Historically, mycology was a branch of microbiology, and many\nmycologists start their careers with a degree in microbiology. To become a mycologist, a bachelor's degree in\n610\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\na biological science (preferably majoring in microbiology) and a master's degree in mycology are minimally necessary.\nMycologists can specialize in taxonomy and fungal genomics, molecular and cellular biology, plant pathology, biotechnology, or\nbiochemistry. Some medical microbiologists concentrate on the study of infectious diseases caused by fungi, called mycoses.\nMycologists collaborate with zoologists and plant pathologists to identify and control difficult fungal infections, such as the\ndevastating chestnut blight, the mysterious decline in frog populations in many areas of the world, or the deadly epidemic called\nwhite nose syndrome, which is decimating bats in the Eastern United States.\nGovernment agencies hire mycologists as research scientists and technicians to monitor the health of crops, national parks, and\nnational forests. Mycologists are also employed in the private sector by companies that develop chemical and biological control\nproducts or new agricultural products, and by companies that provide disease control services. Because of the key role played by\nfungi in the fermentation of alcohol and the preparation of many important foods, scientists with a good understanding of\nfungal physiology routinely work in the food technology industry. Oenology, the science of wine making, relies not only on the\nknowledge of grape varietals and soil composition, but also on a solid understanding of the characteristics of the wild yeasts\nthat thrive in different wine-making regions. It is possible to purchase yeast strains isolated from specific grape-growing\nregions. The great French chemist and microbiologist, Louis Pasteur, made many of his essential discoveries working on the\nhumble brewer\u2019s yeast, thus discovering the process of fermentation.\nCell Structure and Function\nFungi are eukaryotes, and as such, have a complex cellular organization. As eukaryotes, fungal cells contain a membrane-bound\nnucleus. The DNA in the nucleus is wrapped around histone proteins, as is observed in other eukaryotic cells. A few types of\nfungi have accessory genomic structures comparable to bacterial plasmids (loops of DNA); however, the horizontal transfer of\ngenetic information that occurs between one bacterium and another rarely occurs in fungi. Fungal cells also contain\nmitochondria and a complex system of internal membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.\nUnlike plant cells, fungal cells do not have chloroplasts or chlorophyll. Many fungi display bright colors arising from other\ncellular pigments, ranging from red to green to black. The poisonous Amanita muscaria (fly agaric) is recognizable by its bright\nred cap with white patches (Figure 24.2). Pigments in fungi are associated with the cell wall and play a protective role against\nultraviolet radiation. Some fungal pigments are toxic to humans.\nFigure 24.2 Amanita. The poisonous Amanita muscaria is native to temperate and boreal regions of North America. (credit: Christine Majul)\nLike plant cells, fungal cells have a thick cell wall. The rigid layers of fungal cell walls contain complex polysaccharides called\nchitin and glucans. Chitin (N-acetyl-D-glucosamine), also found in the exoskeleton of arthropods such as insects, gives\nstructural strength to the cell walls of fungi. The wall protects the cell from desiccation and some predators. Fungi have plasma\nmembranes similar to those of other eukaryotes, except that the structure is stabilized by ergosterol: a steroid molecule that\nreplaces the cholesterol found in animal cell membranes. Most members of the kingdom Fungi are nonmotile. However, flagella\nare produced by the spores and gametes in the primitive Phylum Chytridiomycota.\nGrowth\nThe vegetative body of a fungus is a unicellular or multicellular thallus. Unicellular fungi are called yeasts. Multicellular fungi\nproduce threadlike hyphae (singular hypha). Dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending\non environmental conditions. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker\u2019s yeast) and Candida species (the agents of thrush, a common\n24.1 \u2022 Characteristics of Fungi\n611\nfungal infection) are examples of unicellular fungi (Figure 24.3).\nFigure 24.3 Candida albicans. Candida albicans is a yeast cell and the agent of candidiasis and thrush. This organism has a similar\nmorphology to coccus bacteria; however, yeast is a eukaryotic organism (note the nucleus). (credit: modification of work by Dr. Godon\nRoberstad, CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nMost fungi are multicellular organisms. They display two distinct morphological stages: the vegetative and reproductive. The\nvegetative stage consists of a tangle of hyphae, whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous. The mass of hyphae is a\nmycelium (Figure 24.4). It can grow on a surface, in soil or decaying material, in a liquid, or even on living tissue. Although\nindividual hyphae must be observed under a microscope, the mycelium of a fungus can be very large, with some species truly\nbeing \u201cthe fungus humongous.\u201d The giant Armillaria solidipes (honey mushroom) is considered the largest organism on Earth,\nspreading across more than 2,000 acres of underground soil in eastern Oregon; it is estimated to be at least 2,400 years old.\nFigure 24.4 A fungal mycelium. The mycelium of the fungus Neotestudina rosati can be pathogenic to humans. The fungus enters through a\ncut or scrape and develops a mycetoma, a chronic subcutaneous infection. (credit: CDC)\nMost fungal hyphae are divided into separate cells by endwalls called septa (singular, septum) (Figure 24.5a, c). In most phyla of\nfungi, tiny holes in the septa allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from cell to cell along the hypha. They are\ndescribed as perforated septa. The hyphae in bread molds (which belong to the Phylum Zygomycota) are not separated by septa.\nInstead, they are formed by large cells containing many nuclei (multinucleate), an arrangement described as coenocytic hyphae\n(Figure 24.5b).\n612\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 24.5 Fungal hyphae. Fungal hyphae may be (a) septated or (b) coenocytic (coeno- = \"common\"; -cytic = \"cell\") with many nuclei\npresent in a single hypha. A bright field light micrograph of (c) Phialophora richardsiae shows septa that divide the hyphae. (credit c:\nmodification of work by Dr. Lucille Georg, CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nFungi thrive in environments that are moist and slightly acidic, and can grow with or without light. They vary in their oxygen\nrequirement. Most fungi are obligate aerobes, requiring oxygen to survive. Other species, such as members of the\nChytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle, are obligate anaerobes, in that they only use anaerobic respiration because\noxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them. Yeasts are intermediate, being facultative anaerobes. This means that they\ngrow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration, but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not\navailable. The alcohol produced from yeast fermentation is used in wine and beer production.\nNutrition\nLike animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they use complex organic compounds as a source of carbon, rather than fix carbon dioxide\nfrom the atmosphere as do some bacteria and most plants. In addition, fungi do not fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. Like\nanimals, they must obtain it from their diet. However, unlike most animals, which ingest food and then digest it internally in\nspecialized organs, fungi perform these steps in the reverse order; digestion precedes ingestion. First, exoenzymes are\ntransported out of the hyphae, where they process nutrients in the environment. Then, the smaller molecules produced by this\nexternal digestion are absorbed through the large surface area of the mycelium. As with animal cells, the polysaccharide of\nstorage is glycogen, a branched polysaccaride, rather than amylopectin, a less densely branched polysaccharide, and amylose, a\nlinear polysaccharide, as found in plants.\nFungi are mostly saprobes (saprophyte is an equivalent term): organisms that derive nutrients from decaying organic matter.\nThey obtain their nutrients from dead or decomposing organic material derived mainly from plants. Fungal exoenzymes are\nable to break down insoluble compounds, such as the cellulose and lignin of dead wood, into readily absorbable glucose\nmolecules. The carbon, nitrogen, and other elements are thus released into the environment. Because of their varied metabolic\npathways, fungi fulfill an important ecological role and are being investigated as potential tools in bioremediation of chemically\ndamaged ecosystems. For example, some species of fungi can be used to break down diesel oil and polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs). Other species take up heavy metals, such as cadmium and lead.\nSome fungi are parasitic, infecting either plants or animals. Smut and Dutch elm disease affect plants, whereas athlete\u2019s foot\nand candidiasis (thrush) are medically important fungal infections in humans. In environments poor in nitrogen, some fungi\nresort to predation of nematodes (small non-segmented roundworms). In fact, species of Arthrobotrys fungi have a number of\nmechanisms to trap nematodes: One mechanism involves constricting rings within the network of hyphae. The rings swell when\nthey touch the nematode, gripping it in a tight hold. The fungus then penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized\nhyphae called haustoria. Many parasitic fungi possess haustoria, as these structures penetrate the tissues of the host, release\n24.1 \u2022 Characteristics of Fungi\n613\ndigestive enzymes within the host's body, and absorb the digested nutrients.\nReproduction\nFungi reproduce sexually and/or asexually. Perfect fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually, while the so-called imperfect\nfungi reproduce only asexually (by mitosis).\nIn both sexual and asexual reproduction, fungi produce spores that disperse from the parent organism by either floating on the\nwind or hitching a ride on an animal. Fungal spores are smaller and lighter than plant seeds. For example, the giant puffball\nmushroom bursts open and releases trillions of spores in a massive cloud of what looks like finely particulate dust. The huge\nnumber of spores released increases the likelihood of landing in an environment that will support growth (Figure 24.6).\nFigure 24.6 Puffball and spores. The (a) giant puffball mushroom releases (b) a cloud of spores when it reaches maturity. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Roger Griffith; credit b: modification of work by Pearson Scott Foresman, donated to the Wikimedia Foundation)\nAsexual Reproduction\nFungi reproduce asexually by fragmentation, budding, or producing spores. Fragments of hyphae can grow new colonies.\nSomatic cells in yeast form buds. During budding (an expanded type of cytokinesis), a bulge forms on the side of the cell, the\nnucleus divides mitotically, and the bud ultimately detaches itself from the mother cell (Figure 24.7).\nFigure 24.7 Budding in Histoplasma. The dark cells in this bright field light micrograph are the pathogenic yeast Histoplasma capsulatum,\nseen against a backdrop of light blue tissue. Histoplasma primarily infects lungs but can spread to other tissues, causing histoplasmosis, a\npotentially fatal disease. (credit: modification of work by Dr. Libero Ajello, CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe most common mode of asexual reproduction is through the formation of asexual spores, which are produced by a single\nindividual thallus (through mitosis) and are genetically identical to the parent thallus (Figure 24.8). Spores allow fungi to expand\ntheir distribution and colonize new environments. They may be released from the parent thallus either outside or within a\nspecial reproductive sac called a sporangium.\n614\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 24.8 Generalized fungal life cycle. Fungi may have both asexual and sexual stages of reproduction.\nThere are many types of asexual spores. Conidiospores are unicellular or multicellular spores that are released directly from the\ntip or side of the hypha. Other asexual spores originate in the fragmentation of a hypha to form single cells that are released as\nspores; some of these have a thick wall surrounding the fragment. Yet others bud off the vegetative parent cell. In contrast to\nconidiospores, sporangiospores are produced directly from a sporangium (Figure 24.9).\nFigure 24.9 Sporangiospores. This bright field light micrograph shows the release of spores from a sporangium at the end of a hypha called\na sporangiophore. The organism is a Mucor sp. fungus, a mold often found indoors. (credit: modification of work by Dr. Lucille Georg, CDC;\nscale-bar data from Matt Russell)\n24.1 \u2022 Characteristics of Fungi\n615\nSexual Reproduction\nSexual reproduction introduces genetic variation into a population of fungi. In fungi, sexual reproduction often occurs in\nresponse to adverse environmental conditions. During sexual reproduction, two mating types are produced. When both mating\ntypes are present in the same mycelium, it is called homothallic, or self-fertile. Heterothallic mycelia require two different, but\ncompatible, mycelia to reproduce sexually.\nAlthough there are many variations in fungal sexual reproduction, all include the following three stages (Figure 24.8). First,\nduring plasmogamy (literally, \u201cmarriage or union of cytoplasm\u201d), two haploid cells fuse, leading to a dikaryotic stage where two\nhaploid nuclei coexist in a single cell. During karyogamy (\u201cnuclear marriage\u201d), the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote\nnucleus. Finally, meiosis takes place in the gametangia (singular, gametangium) organs, in which gametes of different mating\ntypes are generated. At this stage, spores are disseminated into the environment.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReview the characteristics of fungi by visiting this interactive site (http://openstax.org/l/fungi_kingdom) from Wisconsin-\nonline.\n24.2 Classifications of Fungi\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nIdentify fungi and place them into the five major phyla according to current classification\n\u2022\nDescribe each phylum in terms of major representative species and patterns of reproduction\nThe kingdom Fungi contains five major phyla that were established according to their mode of sexual reproduction or using\nmolecular data. Polyphyletic, unrelated fungi that reproduce without a sexual cycle, were once placed for convenience in a sixth\ngroup, the Deuteromycota, called a \u201cform phylum,\u201d because superficially they appeared to be similar. However, most mycologists\nhave discontinued this practice. Rapid advances in molecular biology and the sequencing of 18S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) continue\nto show new and different relationships among the various categories of fungi.\nThe five true phyla of fungi are the Chytridiomycota (Chytrids), the Zygomycota (conjugated fungi), the Ascomycota (sac fungi),\nthe Basidiomycota (club fungi) and the recently described Phylum Glomeromycota (Figure 24.10).\nFigure 24.10 Fungal phyla. Note: \u201c-mycota\u201d is used to designate a phylum while \u201c-mycetes\u201d formally denotes a class or is used informally\nto refer to all members of the phylum.\nChytridiomycota: The Chytrids\nThe only class in the Phylum Chytridiomycota is the Chytridiomycetes. The chytrids are the simplest and most primitive\n616\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nEumycota, or true fungi. The evolutionary record shows that the first recognizable chytrids appeared during the late pre-\nCambrian period, more than 500 million years ago. Like all fungi, chytrids have chitin in their cell walls, but one group of\nchytrids has both cellulose and chitin in the cell wall. Most chytrids are unicellular; however, a few form multicellular organisms\nand hyphae, which have no septa between cells (coenocytic). The Chytrids are the only fungi that have retained flagella. They\nproduce both gametes and diploid zoospores that swim with the help of a single flagellum. An unusual feature of the chytrids is\nthat both male and female gametes are flagellated.\nThe ecological habitat and cell structure of chytrids have much in common with protists. Chytrids usually live in aquatic\nenvironments, although some species live on land. Some species thrive as parasites on plants, insects, or amphibians (Figure\n24.11), while others are saprobes. The chytrid species Allomyces is well characterized as an experimental organism. Its\nreproductive cycle includes both asexual and sexual phases. Allomyces produces diploid or haploid flagellated zoospores in a\nsporangium.\nFigure 24.11 Chytrids. The chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is seen in these light micrographs as transparent spheres growing on\n(a) a freshwater arthropod (water mite) and (b) algae. This chytrid causes skin diseases in many species of amphibians, resulting in species\ndecline and extinction. (credit: modification of work by Johnson ML, Speare R., CDC)\nZygomycota: The Conjugated Fungi\nThe zygomycetes are a relatively small group of fungi belonging to the Phylum Zygomycota. They include the familiar bread\nmold, Rhizopus stolonifer, which rapidly propagates on the surfaces of breads, fruits, and vegetables. Most species are\nsaprobes, living off decaying organic material; a few are parasites, particularly of insects. Zygomycetes play a considerable\ncommercial role. For example, the metabolic products of some species of Rhizopus are intermediates in the synthesis of semi-\nsynthetic steroid hormones.\nZygomycetes have a thallus of coenocytic hyphae in which the nuclei are haploid when the organism is in the vegetative stage.\nThe fungi usually reproduce asexually by producing sporangiospores (Figure 24.12). The black tips of bread mold are the swollen\nsporangia packed with black spores (Figure 24.13). When spores land on a suitable substrate, they germinate and produce a new\n24.2 \u2022 Classifications of Fungi\n617\nmycelium. Sexual reproduction starts when environmental conditions become unfavorable. Two opposing mating strains (type +\nand type \u2013) must be in close proximity for gametangia from the hyphae to be produced and fuse, leading to karyogamy. Each\nzygospore can contain several diploid nuclei. The developing diploid zygospores have thick coats that protect them from\ndesiccation and other hazards. They may remain dormant until environmental conditions are favorable. When the zygospore\ngerminates, it undergoes meiosis and produces haploid spores, which will, in turn, grow into a new organism. This form of\nsexual reproduction in fungi is called conjugation (although it differs markedly from conjugation in bacteria and protists),\ngiving rise to the name \u201cconjugated fungi\u201d.\nFigure 24.12 Zygomycete life cycle. Zygomycetes have asexual and sexual phases in their life cycles. In the asexual phase, spores are\nproduced from haploid sporangia by mitosis (not shown). In the sexual phase, plus and minus haploid mating types conjugate to form a\nheterokaryotic zygosporangium. Karyogamy then produces a diploid zygote. Diploid cells in the zygote undergo meiosis and germinate to\nform a haploid sporangium, which releases the next generation of haploid spores.\n618\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 24.13 Rhizopus spores.

(credit b: modification of work by\n\"polandeze\"/Flickr)\nAscomycota: The Sac Fungi\nThe majority of known fungi belong to the Phylum Ascomycota, which is characterized by the formation of an ascus (plural,\nasci), a sac-like structure that contains haploid ascospores. Filamentous ascomycetes produce hyphae divided by perforated\nsepta, allowing streaming of cytoplasm from one cell to another. Conidia and asci, which are used respectively for asexual and\nsexual reproduction, are usually separated from the vegetative hyphae by blocked (non-perforated) septa. Many ascomycetes are\nof commercial importance. Some play a beneficial role for humanity, such as the yeasts used in baking, brewing, and wine\nfermentation, and directly as food delicacies such as truffles and morels. Aspergillus oryzae is used in the fermentation of rice to\nproduce sake. Other ascomycetes parasitize plants and animals, including humans. For example, fungal pneumonia poses a\nsignificant threat to AIDS patients who have a compromised immune system. Ascomycetes not only infest and destroy crops\ndirectly; they also produce poisonous secondary metabolites that make crops unfit for consumption.\nAsexual reproduction is frequent and involves the production of conidiophores that release haploid conidiospores (Figure 24.14).\nSexual reproduction starts with the development of special hyphae from either one of two types of mating strains (Figure 24.14).\nThe \u201cmale\u201d strain produces an antheridium and the \u201cfemale\u201d strain develops an ascogonium. At fertilization, the antheridium\nand the ascogonium combine in plasmogamy, without nuclear fusion. Special dikaryotic ascogenous (ascus-producing) hyphae\narise from this dikaryon, in which each cell has pairs of nuclei: one from the \u201cmale\u201d strain and one from the \u201cfemale\u201d strain. In\neach ascus, two haploid nuclei fuse in karyogamy. Thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called the ascocarp. The diploid nucleus\nin each ascus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis, and spore walls form around each nucleus. The spores in each ascus contain\nthe meiotic products of a single diploid nucleus. The ascospores are then released, germinate, and form hyphae that are\ndisseminated in the environment and start new mycelia (Figure 24.15).\n24.2 \u2022 Classifications of Fungi\n619\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 24.14 Ascomycete life cycle. The lifecycle of an ascomycete is characterized by the production of asci during the sexual phase. In\neach ascus, the four nuclei produced by meiosis divide once mitotically for a total of eight haploid ascospores. The haploid phase is the\npredominant phase of the life cycle in Ascomycetes.\nWhich of the following statements is true?\na.\nA dikaryotic ascus that forms in the ascocarp undergoes karyogamy, meiosis, and mitosis to form eight ascospores.\nb.\nA diploid ascus that forms in the ascocarp undergoes karyogamy, meiosis, and mitosis to form eight ascospores.\nc.\nA haploid zygote that forms in the ascocarp undergoes karyogamy, meiosis, and mitosis to form eight ascospores.\nd.\nA dikaryotic ascus that forms in the ascocarp undergoes plasmogamy, meiosis, and mitosis to form eight ascospores.\n620\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 24.15 Ascospores.

(credit: modification of work by Dr. Lucille Georg, CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nBasidiomycota: The Club Fungi\nThe fungi in the Phylum Basidiomycota are easily recognizable under a light microscope by their club-shaped fruiting bodies\ncalled basidia (singular, basidium), which are the swollen terminal cells of hyphae. The basidia, which are the reproductive\norgans of these fungi, are often contained within the familiar mushroom, commonly seen in fields after rain, on the\nsupermarket shelves, and growing on your lawn (Figure 24.16). These mushroom-producing basidiomycetes are sometimes\nreferred to as \u201cgill fungi\u201d because of the presence of gill-like structures on the underside of the cap. The gills are actually\ncompacted hyphae on which the basidia are borne. This group also includes shelf fungi, which cling to the bark of trees like\nsmall shelves. In addition, the basidiomycota include smuts and rusts, which are important plant pathogens. Most edible fungi\nbelong to the Phylum Basidiomycota; however, some basidiomycota are inedible and produce deadly toxins. For example,\nCryptococcus neoformans causes severe respiratory illness. The infamous death cap mushroom (Amanita phalloides) is related\nto the fly agaric seen at the beginning of the previous section.\nFigure 24.16 Fairy ring. The fruiting bodies of a basidiomycete form a ring in a meadow, commonly called \u201cfairy ring.\u201d The best-known fairy\nring fungus has the scientific name Marasmius oreades. The body of this fungus, its mycelium, is underground and grows outward in a\n24.2 \u2022 Classifications of Fungi\n621\ncircle. As it grows, the mycelium depletes the soil of nitrogen, causing the mycelia to grow away from the center and leading to the \u201cfairy\nring\u201d of fruiting bodies where there is adequate soil nitrogen. (Credit: \"Cropcircles\"/Wikipedia Commons)]\nThe lifecycle of basidiomycetes includes alternation of generations (Figure 24.17). Most fungi are haploid through most of their\nlife cycles, but the basidiomycetes produce both haploid and dikaryotic mycelia, with the dikaryotic phase being dominant.\n(Note: The dikaryotic phase is technically not diploid, since the nuclei remain unfused until shortly before spore production.) In\nthe basidiomycetes, sexual spores are more common than asexual spores. The sexual spores form in the club-shaped basidium\nand are called basidiospores. In the basidium, nuclei of two different mating strains fuse (karyogamy), giving rise to a diploid\nzygote that then undergoes meiosis. The haploid nuclei migrate into four different chambers appended to the basidium, and\nthen become basidiospores.\nEach basidiospore germinates and generates monokaryotic haploid hyphae. The mycelium that results is called a primary\nmycelium. Mycelia of different mating strains can combine and produce a secondary mycelium that contains haploid nuclei of\ntwo different mating strains. This is the dominant dikaryotic stage of the basidiomycete life cycle. Thus, each cell in this\nmycelium has two haploid nuclei, which will not fuse until formation of the basidium. Eventually, the secondary mycelium\ngenerates a basidiocarp, a fruiting body that protrudes from the ground\u2014this is what we think of as a mushroom. The\nbasidiocarp bears the developing basidia on the gills under its cap.\n622\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 24.17 Basidiomycete life cycle. The lifecycle of a basidiomycete has alternate generations with haploid and dikaryotic mycelia.\nHaploid primary mycelia fuse to form a dikaryotic secondary mycelium, which is the dominant stage of the life cycle, and produces the\nbasidiocarp.\nWhich of the following statements is true?\na.\nA basidium is the fruiting body of a mushroom-producing fungus, and it forms four basidiocarps.\nb.\nThe result of the plasmogamy step is four basidiospores.\nc.\nKaryogamy results directly in the formation of mycelia.\nd.\nA basidiocarp is the fruiting body of a mushroom-producing fungus.\nAsexual Ascomycota and Basidiomycota\nImperfect fungi\u2014those that do not display a sexual phase\u2014were formerly classified in the form phylum Deuteromycota, an\ninvalid taxon no longer used in the present, ever-developing classification of organisms. While Deuteromycota was once a\nclassification taxon, recent molecular analysis has shown that some of the members classified in this group belong to the\nAscomycota (Figure 24.18) or the Basidiomycota. Because some members of this group have not yet been appropriately\n24.2 \u2022 Classifications of Fungi\n623\nclassified, they are less well described in comparison to members of other fungal taxa. Most imperfect fungi live on land, with a\nfew aquatic exceptions. They form visible mycelia with a fuzzy appearance and are commonly known as mold.\nFigure 24.18 Aspergillus. Aspergillus niger is an asexually reproducing fungus (phylum Ascomycota) commonly found as a food\ncontaminant. The spherical structure in this light micrograph is an asexual conidiophore. Molecular studies have placed Aspergillus with the\nascomycetes and sexual cycles have been identified in some species. (credit: modification of work by Dr. Lucille Georg, CDC; scale-bar data\nfrom Matt Russell)\nThe fungi in this group have a large impact on everyday human life. The food industry relies on them for ripening some cheeses.\nThe blue veins in Roquefort cheese and the white crust on Camembert are the result of fungal growth. The antibiotic penicillin\nwas originally discovered on an overgrown Petri plate, on which a colony of Penicillium fungi had killed the bacterial growth\nsurrounding it. Other fungi in this group cause serious diseases, either directly as parasites (which infect both plants and\nhumans), or as producers of potent toxic compounds, as seen in the aflatoxins released by fungi of the genus Aspergillus.\nGlomeromycota\nThe Glomeromycota is a newly established phylum that comprises about 230 species, all of which are involved in close\nassociations with the roots of trees. Fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history.\nIt appears that nearly all members of this family form arbuscular mycorrhizae: the hyphae interact with the root cells forming a\nmutually beneficial association in which the plants supply the carbon source and energy in the form of carbohydrates to the\nfungus, and the fungus supplies essential minerals from the soil to the plant. The exception is Geosiphon pyriformis, which\nhosts the cyanobacterium Nostoc as an endosymbiont.\nThe glomeromycetes do not reproduce sexually and do not survive without the presence of plant roots. Although they have\ncoenocytic hyphae like the zygomycetes, they do not form zygospores. DNA analysis shows that all glomeromycetes probably\ndescended from a common ancestor, making them a monophyletic lineage.\n24.3 Ecology of Fungi\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the role of fungi in various ecosystems\n\u2022\nDescribe mutualistic relationships of fungi with plant roots and photosynthetic organisms\n\u2022\nDescribe the beneficial relationship between some fungi and insects\nFungi play a crucial role in the constantly changing \u201cbalance\u201d of ecosystems. They colonize most habitats on Earth, preferring\ndark, moist conditions. They can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, such as the tundra, thanks to a most successful\nsymbiosis with photosynthetic organisms like algae to produce lichens. Within their communities, fungi are not as obvious as\nare large animals or tall treas. Like bacteria, they act behind the scene as major decomposers. With their versatile metabolism,\nfungi break down organic matter, which would otherwise not be recycled.\nHabitats\nAlthough fungi are primarily associated with humid and cool environments that provide a supply of organic matter, they\ncolonize a surprising diversity of habitats, from seawater to human skin and mucous membranes. Chytrids are found primarily\nin aquatic environments. Other fungi, such as Coccidioides immitis, which causes pneumonia when its spores are inhaled,\n624\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthrive in the dry and sandy soil of the southwestern United States. Fungi that parasitize coral reefs live in the ocean. However,\nmost members of the Kingdom Fungi grow on the forest floor, where the dark and damp environment is rich in decaying debris\nfrom plants and animals. In these environments, fungi play a major role as decomposers and recyclers, making it possible for\nmembers of the other kingdoms to be supplied with nutrients and live.\nDecomposers and Recyclers\nThe food web would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter (Figure 24.19). Some elements\u2014such as\nnitrogen and phosphorus\u2014are required in large quantities by biological systems, and yet are not abundant in the environment.\nThe action of fungi releases these elements from decaying matter, making them available to other living organisms. Trace\nelements present in low amounts in many habitats are essential for growth, and would remain tied up in rotting organic matter\nif fungi and bacteria did not return them to the environment via their metabolic activity.\nFigure 24.19 Bracket fungi. Fungi are an important part of ecosystem nutrient cycles. These bracket fungi growing on the side of a tree are\nthe fruiting structures of a basidiomycete. They receive their nutrients through their hyphae, which invade and decay the tree trunk. (credit:\nCory Zanker)\nThe ability of fungi to degrade many large and insoluble molecules is due to their mode of nutrition. As seen earlier, digestion\nprecedes ingestion. Fungi produce a variety of exoenzymes to digest nutrients. The enzymes are either released into the\nsubstrate or remain bound to the outside of the fungal cell wall. Large molecules are broken down into small molecules, which\nare transported into the cell by a system of protein carriers embedded in the cell membrane. Because the movement of small\nmolecules and enzymes is dependent on the presence of water, active growth depends on a relatively high percentage of\nmoisture in the environment.\nAs saprobes, fungi help maintain a sustainable ecosystem for the animals and plants that share the same habitat. In addition to\nreplenishing the environment with nutrients, fungi interact directly with other organisms in beneficial, and sometimes\ndamaging, ways (Figure 24.20).\n24.3 \u2022 Ecology of Fungi\n625\nFigure 24.20 Shelf fungi. Shelf fungi, so called because they grow on trees in a stack, attack and digest the trunk or branches of a tree.\nWhile some shelf fungi are found only on dead trees, others can parasitize living trees and cause eventual death, so they are considered\nserious tree pathogens. (credit: Cory Zanker)\nMutualistic Relationships\nSymbiosis is the ecological interaction between two organisms that live together. This definition does not describe the type or\nquality of the interaction. When both members of the association benefit, the symbiotic relationship is called mutualistic. Fungi\nform mutualistic associations with many types of organisms, including cyanobacteria, algae, plants, and animals.\nFungus/Plant Mutualism\nOne of the most remarkable associations between fungi and plants is the establishment of mycorrhizae. Mycorrhiza, which is\nderived from the Greek words myco meaning fungus and rhizo meaning root, refers to the fungal partner of a mutualistic\nassociation between vascular plant roots and their symbiotic fungi. Nearly 90 percent of all vascular plant species have\nmycorrhizal partners. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungal mycelia use their extensive network of hyphae and large surface\narea in contact with the soil to channel water and minerals from the soil into the plant. In exchange, the plant supplies the\nproducts of photosynthesis to fuel the metabolism of the fungus.\nThere are several basic types of mycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae (\u201coutside\u201d mycorrhizae) depend on fungi enveloping the roots in\na sheath (called a mantle). Hyphae grow from the mantle into the root and envelope the outer layers of the root cells in a network\nof hyphae called a Hartig net (Figure 24.21). The fungal partner can belong to the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota or Zygomycota.\nEndomycorrhizae (\"inside\" mycorrhizae), also called arbuscular mycorrhizae, are produced when the fungi grow inside the root\nin a branched structure called an arbuscule (from the Latin for \u201clittle trees\u201d). The fungal partners of endomycorrhizal associates\nall belong to the Glomeromycota. The fungal arbuscules penetrate root cells between the cell wall and the plasma membrane and\nare the site of the metabolic exchanges between the fungus and the host plant (Figure 24.21b and Figure 24.22b). Orchids rely on\na third type of mycorrhiza. Orchids are epiphytes that typically produce very small airborne seeds without much storage to\nsustain germination and growth. Their seeds will not germinate without a mycorrhizal partner (usually a Basidiomycete). After\nnutrients in the seed are depleted, fungal symbionts support the growth of the orchid by providing necessary carbohydrates and\nminerals. Some orchids continue to be mycorrhizal throughout their life cycle.\n626\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 24.21 Two types of mycorrhizae.

The (a) infection of Pinus radiata (Monterey pine) roots by the hyphae of Amanita muscaria (fly amanita) causes\nthe pine tree to produce many small, branched rootlets. The Amanita hyphae cover these small roots with a white mantle.

(credit a: modification of work by Randy Molina, USDA; credit b: modification of work by Sara Wright, USDA-ARS; scale-bar\ndata from Matt Russell)\nOther examples of fungus\u2013plant mutualism include the endophytes: fungi that live inside tissue without damaging the host\nplant. Endophytes release toxins that repel herbivores, or confer resistance to environmental stress factors, such as infection by\nmicroorganisms, drought, or heavy metals in soil.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nCoevolution of Land Plants and Mycorrhizae\nAs we have seen, mycorrhizae are the fungal partners of a mutually beneficial symbiotic association that coevolved between\nroots of vascular plants and fungi. A well-supported theory proposes that fungi were instrumental in the evolution of the root\nsystem in plants and contributed to the success of Angiosperms. The bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), which are considered\nthe most ancestral plants and the first to survive and adapt on land, have simple underground rhizoids, rather than a true root\n24.3 \u2022 Ecology of Fungi\n627\nsystem, and therefore cannot survive in dry areas. However, some bryophytes have arbuscular mycorrhizae and some do not.\nTrue roots first appeared in the ancestral vascular plants: Vascular plants that developed a system of thin extensions from their\nroots would have had a selective advantage over nonvascular plants because they had a greater surface area of contact with the\nfungal partners than did the rhizoids of mosses and liverworts. The first true roots would have allowed vascular plants to obtain\nmore water and nutrients in the ground.\nFossil records indicate that fungi actually preceded the invasion of ancestral freshwater plants onto dry land. The first\nassociation between fungi and photosynthetic organisms on land involved moss-like plants and endophytes. These early\nassociations developed before roots appeared in plants. Slowly, the benefits of the endophyte and rhizoid interactions for both\npartners led to present-day mycorrhizae: About 90 percent of today\u2019s vascular plants have associations with fungi in their\nrhizosphere.\nThe fungi involved in mycorrhizae display many characteristics of ancestral fungi; they produce simple spores, show little\ndiversification, do not have a sexual reproductive cycle, and cannot live outside of a mycorrhizal association. The plants\nbenefited from the association because mycorrhizae allowed them to move into new habitats and allowed the increased uptake\nof nutrients, which gave them an enormous selective advantage over plants that did not establish symbiotic relationships.\nLichens\nLichens display a range of colors and textures (Figure 24.23) and can survive in the most unusual and hostile habitats. They cover\nrocks, gravestones, tree bark, and the ground in the tundra where plant roots cannot penetrate. Lichens can survive extended\nperiods of drought, when they become completely desiccated, and then rapidly become active once water is available again.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nExplore the world of lichens using this site (http://openstax.org/l/lichenland) from Oregon State University.\nFigure 24.23 Lichens. Lichens have many forms. They may be (a) crust-like, (b) hair-like, or (c) leaf-like. (credit a: modification of work by Jo\nNaylor; credit b: modification of work by \"djpmapleferryman\"/Flickr; credit c: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\nIt is important to note that lichens are not a single organism, but rather another wonderful example of a mutualism, in which a\nfungus (usually a member of the Ascomycota or Basidiomycota) lives in a physical and physiological relationship with a\nphotosynthetic organism (a eukaryotic alga or a prokaryotic cyanobacterium) (Figure 24.24). Generally, neither the fungus nor\nthe photosynthetic organism can survive alone outside of the symbiotic relationship. The body of a lichen, referred to as a\nthallus, is formed of hyphae wrapped around the photosynthetic partner. The photosynthetic organism provides carbon and\nenergy in the form of carbohydrates. Some cyanobacteria additionally fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, contributing\nnitrogenous compounds to the association. In return, the fungus supplies minerals and protection from dryness and excessive\nlight by encasing the algae in its mycelium. The fungus also attaches the lichen to its substrate.\n628\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 24.24 Structure of a lichen. This cross-section of a lichen thallus shows the (a) upper cortex of fungal hyphae, which provides\nprotection; the (b) algal zone where photosynthesis occurs, the (c) medulla of fungal hyphae, and the (d) lower cortex, which also provides\nprotection and may have (e) rhizines to anchor the thallus to the substrate.\nThe thallus of lichens grows very slowly, expanding its diameter a few millimeters per year. Both the fungus and the alga\nparticipate in the formation of dispersal units, called soredia\u2014clusters of algal cells surrounded by mycelia. Soredia are\ndispersed by wind and water and form new lichens.\nLichens are extremely sensitive to air pollution, especially to abnormal levels of nitrogenous and sulfurous compounds. The U.S.\nForest Service and National Park Service can monitor air quality by measuring the relative abundance and health of the lichen\npopulation in an area. Lichens fulfill many ecological roles. Caribou and reindeer eat lichens, and they provide cover for small\ninvertebrates that hide in the mycelium. In the production of textiles, weavers used lichens to dye wool for many centuries until\nthe advent of synthetic dyes. The pigments used in litmus paper are also extracted from lichens.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLichens are used to monitor the quality of air. Read more on this site (http://openstax.org/l/lichen_monitrng) from the United\nStates Forest Service.\nFungus/Animal Mutualism\nFungi have evolved mutualisms with numerous insects in Phylum Arthropoda: joint-legged invertebrates with a chitinous\nexoskeleton. Arthropods depend on the fungus for protection from predators and pathogens, while the fungus obtains nutrients\nand a way to disseminate spores into new environments. The association between species of Basidiomycota and scale insects is\none example. The fungal mycelium covers and protects the insect colonies. The scale insects foster a flow of nutrients from the\nparasitized plant to the fungus.\nIn a second example, leaf-cutter ants of Central and South America literally farm fungi. They cut disks of leaves from plants and\npile them up in subterranean gardens (Figure 24.25). Fungi are cultivated in these disk gardens, digesting the cellulose in the\nleaves that the ants cannot break down. Once smaller sugar molecules are produced and consumed by the fungi, the fungi in\nturn become a meal for the ants. The insects also patrol their garden, preying on competing fungi. Both ants and fungi benefit\nfrom this mutualistic association. The fungus receives a steady supply of leaves and freedom from competition, while the ants\nfeed on the fungi they cultivate.\n24.3 \u2022 Ecology of Fungi\n629\nFigure 24.25 Leaf-cutter ant. A leaf-cutter ant transports a leaf that will feed a farmed fungus. (credit: Scott Bauer, USDA-ARS)\nFungivores\nAnimal dispersal is important for some fungi because an animal may carry fungal spores considerable distances from the\nsource. Fungal spores are rarely completely degraded in the gastrointestinal tract of an animal, and many are able to germinate\nwhen they are passed in the feces. Some \u201cdung fungi\u201d actually require passage through the digestive system of herbivores to\ncomplete their lifecycle. The black truffle\u2014a prized gourmet delicacy\u2014is the fruiting body of an underground ascomycete.\nAlmost all truffles are ectomycorrhizal, and are usually found in close association with trees. Animals eat truffles and disperse\nthe spores. In Italy and France, truffle hunters use female pigs to sniff out truffles (female pigs are attracted to truffles because\nthe fungus releases a volatile compound closely related to a pheromone produced by male pigs.)\n24.4 Fungal Parasites and Pathogens\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe some fungal parasites and pathogens of plants\n\u2022\nDescribe the different types of fungal infections in humans\n\u2022\nExplain why antifungal therapy is hampered by the similarity between fungal and animal cells\nParasitism describes a symbiotic relationship in which one member of the association benefits at the expense of the other. Both\nparasites and pathogens harm the host; however, pathogens cause disease, damage to host tissues or physiology, whereas\nparasites usually do not, but can cause serious damage and death by competition for nutrients or other resources.\nCommensalism occurs when one member benefits without affecting the other.\nPlant Parasites and Pathogens\nThe production of sufficient high-quality crops is essential to human existence. Unfortunately, plant diseases have ruined many\ncrops throughout human agricultural history, sometimes creating widespread famine. Many plant pathogens are fungi that\ncause tissue decay and the eventual death of the host (Figure 24.26). In addition to destroying plant tissue directly, some plant\npathogens spoil crops by producing potent toxins that can further damage and kill the host plant. Fungi are also responsible for\nfood spoilage and the rotting of stored crops. For example, the fungus Claviceps purpurea causes ergot, a disease of cereal crops\n(especially of rye). Although the fungus reduces the yield of cereals, the effects of the ergot's alkaloid toxins on humans and\nanimals are of much greater significance. In animals, the disease is referred to as ergotism. The most common signs and\nsymptoms are convulsions, hallucination, gangrene, and loss of milk in cattle. The active ingredient of ergot is lysergic acid,\nwhich is a precursor of the drug LSD. Smuts, rusts, and powdery or downy mildew are other examples of common fungal\npathogens that affect crops.\n630\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 24.26 Fungal pathogens. Some fungal pathogens include (a) green mold on grapefruit, (b) powdery mildew on a zinnia, (c) stem rust\non a sheaf of barley, and (d) grey rot on grapes. In wet conditions Botrytis cinerea, the fungus that causes grey rot, can destroy a grape crop.\nHowever, controlled infection of grapes by Botrytis results in noble rot, a condition that produces strong and much-prized dessert wines.\n(credit a: modification of work by Scott Bauer, USDA-ARS; credit b: modification of work by Stephen Ausmus, USDA-ARS; credit c:\nmodification of work by David Marshall, USDA-ARS; credit d: modification of work by Joseph Smilanick, USDA-ARS)\nAflatoxins are toxic, carcinogenic compounds released by fungi of the genus Aspergillus. Periodically, harvests of nuts and\ngrains are tainted by aflatoxins, leading to massive recall of produce. This sometimes ruins producers and causes food shortages\nin developing countries.\nAnimal and Human Parasites and Pathogens\nFungi can affect animals, including humans, in several ways. A mycosis is a fungal disease that results from infection and direct\ndamage due to the growth and infiltration of the fungus. Fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues.\nMycotoxicosis is the poisoning of humans (and other animals) by foods contaminated by fungal toxins (mycotoxins).\nMycetismus specifically describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms. In addition, individuals who\ndisplay hypersensitivity to molds and spores may develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions. Fungal infections are\ngenerally very difficult to treat because, unlike bacteria, fungi are eukaryotes. Antibiotics only target prokaryotic cells, whereas\ncompounds that kill fungi also harm the eukaryotic animal host.\nMany fungal infections are superficial; that is, they occur on the animal\u2019s skin. Termed cutaneous (\u201cskin\u201d) mycoses, they can have\ndevastating effects. For example, the decline of the world\u2019s frog population in recent years is caused (in part) by the chytrid\nfungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This deadly fungus infects the skin of frogs and presumably interferes with cutaneous\ngaseous exchange, which is essential for amphibian survival. Similarly, more than a million bats in the United States have been\nkilled by white-nose syndrome, which appears as a white ring around the mouth of the bat. It is caused by the cold-loving\nfungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which disseminates its deadly spores in caves where bats hibernate. Mycologists are\nresearching the transmission, mechanism, and control of P. destructans to stop its spread.\nFungi that cause the superficial mycoses of the epidermis, hair, and nails rarely spread to the underlying tissue (Figure 24.27).\nThese fungi are often misnamed \u201cdermatophytes\u201d, from the Greek words dermis meaning skin and phyte meaning plant,\nalthough they are not plants. Dermatophytes are also called \u201cringworms\u201d because of the red ring they cause on skin. They secrete\n24.4 \u2022 Fungal Parasites and Pathogens\n631\nextracellular enzymes that break down keratin (a protein found in hair, skin, and nails), causing conditions such as athlete\u2019s foot\nand jock itch. These conditions are usually treated with over-the-counter topical creams and powders, and are easily cleared.\nMore persistent superficial mycoses may require prescription oral medications.\nFigure 24.27 Fungal diseases of humans. (a) Ringworm presents as a red ring on skin; (b) Trichophyton violaceum, shown in this bright field\nlight micrograph, causes superficial mycoses on the scalp; (c) Histoplasma capsulatum is an ascomycete that infects airways and causes\nsymptoms similar to influenza. (credit a: modification of work by Dr. Lucille K. Georg, CDC; credit b: modification of work by Dr. Lucille K.\nGeorg, CDC; credit c: modification of work by M. Renz, CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nSystemic mycoses spread to internal organs, most commonly entering the body through the respiratory system. For example,\ncoccidioidomycosis (often called valley fever) is commonly found in the southwestern United States, but as far north as\nWashington, where the fungus resides in the dust. Once inhaled, the spores develop in the lungs and cause symptoms similar to\nthose of tuberculosis. Histoplasmosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. In its human host,\nHistoplasma grows as a yeast, causing pulmonary infections, and in rarer cases, swelling of the membranes of the brain and\nspinal cord. Treatment of these and many other fungal diseases requires the use of antifungal medications that have serious side\neffects.\nOpportunistic mycoses are fungal infections that are either common in all environments, or part of the normal biota. They\nmainly affect individuals who have a compromised immune system. Patients in the late stages of AIDS suffer from\nopportunistic mycoses that can be life threatening. The yeast Candida sp., a common member of the natural biota, can grow\nunchecked and infect the vagina or mouth (oral thrush) if the pH of the surrounding environment, the person\u2019s immune\ndefenses, or the normal population of bacteria are altered.\nMycetismus can occur when poisonous mushrooms are eaten. It causes a number of human fatalities during mushroom-\npicking season. Many edible fruiting bodies of fungi resemble highly poisonous relatives, and amateur mushroom hunters are\ncautioned to carefully inspect their harvest and avoid eating mushrooms of doubtful origin. The adage \u201cthere are bold\nmushroom pickers and old mushroom pickers, but are there no old, bold mushroom pickers\u201d is unfortunately true.\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION\nDutch Elm Disease\nQuestion: Do trees resistant to Dutch elm disease secrete antifungal compounds?\nHypothesis: Construct a hypothesis that addresses this question.\nBackground: Dutch elm disease is a fungal infestation that affects many species of elm (Ulmus) in North America. The fungus\ninfects the vascular system of the tree, which blocks water flow within the plant and mimics drought stress. Accidently\nintroduced to the United States in the early 1930s, it decimated American elm shade trees across the continent. It is caused by\nthe fungus Ophiostoma ulmi. The elm bark beetle acts as a vector and transmits the disease from tree to tree. Many European\nand Asiatic elms are less susceptible to the disease than are American elms.\nTest the hypothesis: A researcher testing this hypothesis might do the following. Inoculate several Petri plates containing a\nmedium that supports the growth of fungi with fragments of Ophiostoma mycelium. Cut (with a metal punch) several disks\nfrom the vascular tissue of susceptible varieties of American elms and resistant European and Asiatic elms. Include control Petri\n632\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nplates inoculated with mycelia without plant tissue to verify that the medium and incubation conditions do not interfere with\nfungal growth. As a positive control, add paper disks impregnated with a known fungicide to Petri plates inoculated with the\nmycelium.\nIncubate the plates for a set number of days to allow fungal growth and spreading of the mycelium over the surface of the plate.\nRecord the diameter of the zone of clearing, if any, around the tissue samples and the fungicide control disk.\nRecord your observations in the following table.\nResults of Antifungal Testing of Vascular Tissue from Different Species of Elm\nDisk\nZone of Inhibition (mm)\nDistilled Water\nFungicide\nTissue from Susceptible Elm #1\nTissue from Susceptible Elm #2\nTissue from Resistant Elm #1\nTissue from Resistant Elm #2\nTable 24.1\nAnalyze the data and report the results. Compare the effect of distilled water to the fungicide. These are negative and positive\ncontrols that validate the experimental setup. The fungicide should be surrounded by a clear zone where the fungus growth was\ninhibited. Is there a difference among different species of elm?\nDraw a conclusion: Was there antifungal activity as expected from the fungicide? Did the results support the hypothesis? If not,\nhow can this be explained? There are several possible explanations.\n24.5 Importance of Fungi in Human Life\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the importance of fungi to the balance of the environment\n\u2022\nSummarize the role of fungi in agriculture and food and beverage preparation\n\u2022\nDescribe the importance of fungi in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of fungi as model organisms\nAlthough we often think of fungi as organisms that cause disease and rot food, they are vitally important to human life on many\nlevels. As we have seen, fungi influence the well-being of human populations on a large scale because they are part of the\nnutrient cycle in ecosystems. They have other ecosystem roles as well. As animal pathogens, fungi help to control the population\nof damaging pests. These fungi are very specific to the insects they attack, and do not infect other animals or plants. Fungi are\ncurrently under investigation as potential microbial insecticides, with several already on the market. For example, the fungus\nBeauveria bassiana is being tested as a possible biological control agent for the recent spread of emerald ash borer a beetle that\nfeeds on ash trees. It has been released in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland (Figure 24.28).\n24.5 \u2022 Importance of Fungi in Human Life\n633\nFigure 24.28 Fungal insect control. The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) is an insect that attacks ash trees. It is in turn parasitized\nby a pathogenic fungus (Beauveria bassiana) that holds promise as a biological insecticide. The parasitic fungus appears as white fuzz on\nthe body of the insect. (credit: Houping Liu, USDA Agricultural Research Service)\nThe mycorrhizal relationship between fungi and plant roots is essential for the productivity of farm land. Without the fungal\npartner in root systems, 80\u201390 percent of trees and grasses would not survive. Mycorrhizal fungal inoculants are available as\nsoil amendments from gardening supply stores and are promoted by supporters of organic agriculture.\nWe also eat some types of fungi. Mushrooms figure prominently in the human diet. Morels, shiitake mushrooms, chanterelles,\nand truffles are considered delicacies (Figure 24.29). The humble meadow mushroom, Agaricus campestris, appears in many\ndishes. Molds of the genus Penicillium ripen many cheeses. They originate in the natural environment such as the caves of\nRoquefort, France, where wheels of sheep milk cheese are stacked in order to capture the molds responsible for the blue veins\nand pungent taste of the cheese.\nFigure 24.29 Edible fungi. The morel mushroom (a) is an ascomycete greatly appreciated for its delicate taste.

Wild yeasts are acquired from the environment and used to ferment sugars into CO2 and ethyl alcohol\nunder anaerobic conditions. It is now possible to purchase isolated strains of wild yeasts from different wine-making regions.\n634\nChapter 24 \u2022 Fungi\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nLouis Pasteur was instrumental in developing a reliable strain of brewer\u2019s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for the French\nbrewing industry in the late 1850s. This was one of the first examples of biotechnology patenting.\nMany secondary metabolites of fungi are of great commercial importance. Antibiotics are naturally produced by fungi to kill or\ninhibit the growth of bacteria, limiting their competition in the natural environment. Important antibiotics, such as penicillin\nand the cephalosporins, are isolated from fungi. Valuable drugs isolated from fungi include the immunosuppressant drug\ncyclosporine (which reduces the risk of rejection after organ transplant), the precursors of steroid hormones, and ergot alkaloids\nused to stop bleeding. Psilocybin is a compound found in fungi such as Psilocybe semilanceata and Gymnopilus junonius, which\nhave been used for their hallucinogenic properties by various cultures for thousands of years.\nAs simple eukaryotic organisms, fungi are important model research organisms. Many advances in modern genetics were\nachieved by the use of the red bread mold Neurospora crassa. Additionally, many important genes originally discovered in S.\ncerevisiae served as a starting point in discovering analogous human genes. As a eukaryotic organism, the yeast cell produces\nand modifies proteins in a manner similar to human cells, as opposed to the bacterium Escherichia coli, which lacks the internal\nmembrane structures and enzymes to tag proteins for export. This makes yeast a much better organism for use in recombinant\nDNA technology experiments. Like bacteria, yeasts grow easily in culture, have a short generation time, and are amenable to\ngenetic modification.\n24.5 \u2022 Importance of Fungi in Human Life\n635\n", "key_terms": "\narbuscular mycorrhiza\nmycorrhizal association in which\nthe fungal hyphae enter the root cells and form extensive\nnetworks\nArbuscular mycorrhizae mycorrhizae commonly involving\nGlomeromycetes in which the fungal hyphae penetrate\nthe cell walls of the plant root cells (but not the cell\nmembranes)\nascocarp\nfruiting body of ascomycetes\nAscomycota\n(also, sac fungi) phylum of fungi that store\nspores in a sac called ascus\nbasidiocarp\nfruiting body that protrudes from the ground\nand bears the basidia\nBasidiomycota\n(also, club fungi) phylum of fungi that\nproduce club-shaped structures (basidia) that contain\nspores\nbasidium\nclub-shaped fruiting body of basidiomycetes\nChytridiomycota\n(also, chytrids) primitive phylum of fungi\nthat live in water and produce gametes with flagella\ncoenocytic hypha\nsingle hypha that lacks septa and\ncontains many nuclei\ncommensalism\nsymbiotic relationship in which one\nmember benefits while the other member is not affected\nDeuteromycota\nformer form phylum of fungi that do not\nhave a known sexual reproductive cycle (presently\nmembers of two phyla: Ascomycota and Basidiomycota)\nectomycorrhiza\nmycorrhizal fungi that surround the roots\nwith a mantle and have a Hartig net that extends into the\nroots between cells\nEctomycorrhizae mycorrhizae in which the fungal hyphae\ndo not penetrate the root cells of the plant\nfacultative anaerobes organisms that can perform both\naerobic and anaerobic respiration and can survive in\noxygen-rich and oxygen-poor environment\nGlomeromycota\nphylum of fungi that form symbiotic\nrelationships with the roots of trees\nhaustoria\nmodified hyphae on many parasitic fungi that\npenetrate the tissues of their hosts, release digestive\nenzymes, and/or absorb nutrients from the host\nheterothallic\ndescribes when only one mating type is\npresent in an individual mycelium\nhomothallic\ndescribes when both mating types are present\nin mycelium\nhypha\nfungal filament composed of one or more cells\nkaryogamy\nfusion of nuclei\nlichen\nclose association of a fungus with a photosynthetic\nalga or bacterium that benefits both partners\nmold\ntangle of visible mycelia with a fuzzy appearance\nmycelium\nmass of fungal hyphae\nmycetismus\ningestion of toxins in poisonous mushrooms\nmycology\nscientific study of fungi\nmycorrhiza\nmutualistic association between fungi and\nvascular plant roots\nmycorrhizae a mutualistic relationship between a plant and\na fungus.

They are heterotrophs and contain\nneither photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll, nor\norganelles such as chloroplasts. Because fungi feed on\ndecaying and dead matter, they are termed saprobes. Fungi\nare important decomposers that release essential elements\ninto the environment. External enzymes called exoenzymes\ndigest nutrients that are absorbed by the body of the fungus,\nwhich is called a thallus. A thick cell wall made of chitin\nsurrounds the cell. Fungi can be unicellular as yeasts, or\ndevelop a network of filaments called a mycelium, which is\noften described as mold. Most species multiply by asexual\nand sexual reproductive cycles and display an alternation of\ngenerations. In one group of fungi, no sexual cycle has been\nidentified. Sexual reproduction involves plasmogamy (the\nfusion of the cytoplasm), followed by karyogamy (the fusion\n636\nChapter 24 \u2022 Key Terms\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nof nuclei). Following these processes, meiosis generates\nhaploid spores.\n24.2 Classifications of Fungi\nChytridiomycota (chytrids) are considered the most ancestral\ngroup of fungi. They are mostly aquatic, and their gametes\nare the only fungal cells known to have flagella. They\nreproduce both sexually and asexually; the asexual spores are\ncalled zoospores. Zygomycota (conjugated fungi) produce\nnon-septate hyphae with many nuclei. Their hyphae fuse\nduring sexual reproduction to produce a zygospore in a\nzygosporangium. Ascomycota (sac fungi) form spores in sacs\ncalled asci during sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction\nis their most common form of reproduction. In the\nBasidiomycota (club fungi), the sexual phase predominates,\nproducing showy fruiting bodies that contain club-shaped\nbasidia, within which spores form. Most familiar\nmushrooms belong to this division. Fungi that have no\nknown sexual cycle were originally classified in the \u201cform\nphylum\u201d Deuteromycota, but many have been classified by\ncomparative molecular analysis with the Ascomycota and\nBasidiomycota. Glomeromycota form tight associations\n(called mycorrhizae) with the roots of plants.\n24.3 Ecology of Fungi\nFungi have colonized nearly all environments on Earth, but\nare frequently found in cool, dark, moist places with a supply\nof decaying material. Fungi are saprobes that decompose\norganic matter. Many successful mutualistic relationships\ninvolve a fungus and another organism. Many fungi\nestablish complex mycorrhizal associations with the roots of\nplants. Some ants farm fungi as a supply of food. Lichens are\na symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a\nphotosynthetic organism, usually an alga or\ncyanobacterium. The photosynthetic organism provides\nenergy from stored carbohydrates, while the fungus supplies\nminerals and protection. Some animals that consume fungi\nhelp disseminate spores over long distances.\n24.4 Fungal Parasites and\nPathogens\nFungi establish parasitic relationships with plants and\nanimals. Fungal diseases can decimate crops and spoil food\nduring storage. Compounds produced by fungi can be toxic\nto humans and other animals. Mycoses are infections caused\nby fungi. Superficial mycoses affect the skin, whereas\nsystemic mycoses spread through the body. Fungal\ninfections are difficult to cure, since fungi, like their hosts,\nare eukaryotic, and cladistically related closely to Kingdom\nAnimalia.\n24.5 Importance of Fungi in Human\nLife\nFungi are important to everyday human life. Fungi are\nimportant decomposers in most ecosystems. Mycorrhizal\nfungi are essential for the growth of most plants. Fungi, as\nfood, play a role in human nutrition in the form of\nmushrooms, and also as agents of fermentation in the\nproduction of bread, cheeses, alcoholic beverages, and\nnumerous other food preparations. Secondary metabolites\nof fungi are used as medicines, such as antibiotics and\nanticoagulants.

Land plants arose within the Archaeplastida, which includes\nthe red algae (Rhodophyta) and two groups of green algae, Chlorophyta and Charaphyta. Most biologists also\nFigure 25.1 Seedless plants, like these horsetails (Equisetum sp.), thrive in damp, shaded\nenvironments under a tree canopy where dryness is rare. (credit: modification of work by Jerry\nKirkhart)\nINTRODUCTION An incredible variety of seedless plants populates the terrestrial landscape. Mosses\nmay grow on a tree trunk, and horsetails may display their jointed stems and spindly leaves across the\nforest floor. Today, seedless plants represent only a small fraction of the plants in our environment; yet,\n300 million years ago, seedless plants dominated the landscape and grew in the enormous swampy\nforests of the Carboniferous period. Their decomposition created large deposits of coal that we mine\ntoday.\nCurrent evolutionary thought holds that all plants\u2014some green algae as well as land plants\u2014are\nmonophyletic; that is, they are descendants of a single common ancestor. The evolutionary transition\nfrom water to land imposed severe constraints on plants. They had to develop strategies to avoid drying\nout, to disperse reproductive cells in air, for structural support, and for capturing and filtering sunlight.\nWhile seed plants have developed adaptations that allow them to populate even the most arid habitats on\nEarth, full independence from water did not happen in all plants. Most seedless plants still require a\nmoist environment for reproduction.\nChapter Outline\n25.1 Early Plant Life\n25.2 Green Algae:\nPrecursors of Land\nPlants\n25.3 Bryophytes\n25.4 Seedless Vascular\nPlants\nconsider at least some green algae to be plants, although others exclude all algae from the plant kingdom.\nThe reason for this disagreement stems from the fact that only green algae, the Chlorophytes and\nCharophytes, share common characteristics with land plants (such as using chlorophyll a and b plus\ncarotene in the same proportion as plants). These characteristics are absent from other types of algae.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nAlgae and Evolutionary Paths to Photosynthesis\nSome scientists consider all algae to be plants, while others assert that only the green algae belong in the\nkingdom Plantae. Still others include only the Charophytes among the plants. These divergent opinions are\nrelated to the different evolutionary paths to photosynthesis selected for in different types of algae. While all\nalgae are photosynthetic\u2014that is, they contain some form of a chloroplast\u2014they didn\u2019t all become\nphotosynthetic via the same path.\nThe ancestors to the Archaeplastida became photosynthetic by forming an endosymbiotic relationship with a\ngreen, photosynthetic bacterium about 1.65 billion years ago. That algal line evolved into the red and green\nalgae, and eventually into the modern mosses, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. Their evolutionary\ntrajectory was relatively straight and monophyletic. In contrast, algae outside of the Archaeplastida, e.g., the\nbrown and golden algae of the stramenopiles, and so on\u2014all became photosynthetic by secondary, or even\ntertiary, endosymbiotic events; that is, they engulfed cells that already contained an endosymbiotic\ncyanobacterium. These latecomers to photosynthesis are parallels to the Archaeplastida in terms of\nautotrophy, but they did not expand to the same extent as the Archaeplastida, nor did they colonize the land.\nScientists who solely track evolutionary straight lines (that is, monophyly), consider only the Charophytes as\nplants. The common ancestor of Charophytes and land plants excludes the other members of the\nArchaeplastida. Charophytes also share other features with the land plants. These will be discussed in more\ndetail in another section.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGo to this article (http://openstax.org/l/charophytes) to get a more in-depth view of the Charophytes.\nPlant Adaptations to Life on Land\nAs organisms adapted to life on land, they had to contend with several challenges in the terrestrial\nenvironment. Water has been described as \u201cthe stuff of life.\u201d The cell\u2019s interior is a thick soup: in this\nmedium, most small molecules dissolve and diffuse, and the majority of the chemical reactions of\nmetabolism take place. Desiccation, or drying out, is a constant danger for an organism exposed to air. Even\nwhen parts of a plant are close to a source of water, the aerial structures are likely to dry out. Water also\nprovides buoyancy to organisms. On land, plants need to develop structural support in a medium that does\nnot give the same lift as water. The organism is also subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation,\nbecause air does not filter out ultraviolet rays of sunlight. Additionally, the male gametes must reach the\nfemale gametes using new strategies, because swimming is no longer possible. Therefore, both gametes and\nzygotes must be protected from desiccation. The successful land plants developed strategies to deal with all\nof these challenges. Not all adaptations appeared at once. Some species never moved very far from the\naquatic environment, whereas others went on to conquer the driest environments on Earth.\nTo balance these survival challenges, life on land offers several advantages. First, sunlight is abundant.\nWater acts as a filter, altering the spectral quality of light absorbed by the photosynthetic pigment\nchlorophyll. Second, carbon dioxide is more readily available in air than in water, since it diffuses faster in\nair. Third, land plants evolved before land animals; therefore, until dry land was colonized by animals, no\npredators threatened plant life. This situation changed as animals emerged from the water and fed on the\nabundant sources of nutrients in the established flora. In turn, plants developed strategies to deter\npredation: from spines and thorns to toxic chemicals.\n642\nChapter 25 \u2022 Seedless Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nEarly land plants, like the early land animals, did not live very far from an abundant source of water and developed survival\nstrategies to combat dryness. One of these strategies is called tolerance. Many mosses, for example, can dry out to a brown and\nbrittle mat, but as soon as rain or a flood makes water available, mosses will absorb it and are restored to their healthy green\nappearance. Another strategy is to colonize environments with high humidity, where droughts are uncommon. Ferns, which are\nconsidered an early lineage of plants, thrive in damp and cool places such as the understory of temperate forests. Later, plants\nmoved away from moist or aquatic environments using resistance to desiccation, rather than tolerance. These plants, like cacti,\nminimize the loss of water to such an extent they can survive in extremely dry environments.\nThe most successful adaptation solution was the development of new structures that gave plants the advantage when colonizing\nnew and dry environments. Four major adaptations contribute to the success of terrestrial plants. The first adaptation is that the\nlife cycle in all land plants exhibits the alternation of generations, a sporophyte in which the spores are formed and a\ngametophyte that produces gametes. Second is an apical meristem tissue in roots and shoots. Third is the evolution of a waxy\ncuticle to resist desiccation (absent from some mosses). Finally cell walls with lignin to support structures off the ground. These\nadaptations all contribute to the success of the land plants, but are noticeably lacking in the closely related green algae\u2014another\nreason for the debate over their placement in the plant kingdom. They are also not all found in the mosses, which can be\nregarded as representing an intermediate stage in adaptation to land.\nAlternation of Generations\nAll sexually reproducing organisms have both haploid and diploid cells in their life cycles. In organisms with haplontic life\ncycles, the haploid stage is dominant, while in organisms with a diplontic life cycle, the diploid stage is the dominant life stage.\nDominant in this context means both the stage in which the organism spends most of its time, and the stage in which most\nmitotic cell reproduction occurs\u2014the multicellular stage. In haplontic life cycles, the only diploid cell is the zygote, which\nundergoes immediate meiosis to restore the haploid state. In diplontic life cycles, the only haploid cells are the gametes, which\ncombine to restore the diploid state at their earliest convenience. Humans, for example, are diplontic.\nAlternation of generations describes a life cycle in which an organism has both haploid and diploid multicellular stages (Figure\n25.2). This type of life cycle, which is found in all plants, is described as haplodiplontic.\nFigure 25.2 Alternation of generations between the 1n gametophyte and 2n sporophyte is shown. Mitosis occurs in both gametophyte and\nsporophyte generations. Diploid sporophytes produce haploid spores by meiosis, while haploid gametophytes produce gametes by mitosis.\n(credit: Peter Coxhead)\nIn alternation of generations, the multicellular haploid form, known as a gametophyte, is followed in the developmental\nsequence by a multicellular diploid form, the sporophyte. The gametophyte gives rise to the gametes (reproductive cells) by\nmitosis. This can be the most obvious phase of the life cycle of the plant, as in the mosses, or it can occur in a microscopic\nstructure, such as a pollen grain, in the seed plants. The evolution of the land plants is marked by increasing prominence of the\nsporophyte generation. The sporophyte stage is barely noticeable in non-vascular plants (the collective term for the plants that\ninclude the liverworts and mosses). In the seed plants, the sporophyte phase can be a towering tree, as in sequoias and pines.\nProtection of the embryo is a major requirement for land plants. The vulnerable embryo must be sheltered from desiccation and\nother environmental hazards. In both seedless and seed plants, the female gametophyte provides protection and nutrients to\nthe embryo as it develops into the new sporophyte. This distinguishing feature of land plants gave the group its alternate name\nof embryophytes.\nSporangia in Seedless Plants\nThe sporophyte of seedless plants is diploid and results from syngamy (fusion) of two gametes. The sporophyte bears the\n25.1 \u2022 Early Plant Life\n643\nsporangia (singular, sporangium). The term \u201csporangia\u201d literally means \u201ca vessel for spores,\u201d as it is a reproductive sac in which\nspores are formed (Figure 25.3). Inside the multicellular sporangia, the diploid sporocytes, or mother cells, produce haploid\nspores by meiosis, during which the 2n chromosome number is reduced to 1n (note that in many plants, chromosome number is\ncomplicated by polyploidy: for example, durum wheat is tetraploid, bread wheat is hexaploid, and some ferns are 1000-ploid).\nThe spores are later released by the sporangia and disperse in the environment. When the haploid spore germinates in a\nhospitable environment, it generates a multicellular gametophyte by mitosis. The gametophyte supports the zygote formed\nfrom the fusion of gametes and the resulting young sporophyte (vegetative form). The cycle then begins anew.\nFigure 25.3 Sporangia. Spore-producing sacs called sporangia grow at the ends of long, thin stalks in this photo of the moss Esporangios\nbryum. (credit: Javier Martin)\nPlants that produce only one type of spore are called homosporous and the resultant gametophyte produces both male and\nfemale gametes, usually on the same individual. Non-vascular plants are homosporous, and the gametophyte is the dominant\ngeneration in the life cycle. Plants that produce two types of spores are called heterosporous. The male spores are called\nmicrospores, because of their smaller size, and develop into the male gametophyte; the comparatively larger megaspores\ndevelop into the female gametophyte. A few seedless vascular plants and all seed plants are heterosporous, and the sporophyte is\nthe dominant generation.\nThe spores of seedless plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as sporopollenin. As the\nname suggests, it is also found in the walls of pollen grains. This complex substance is characterized by long chains of organic\nmolecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids: hence the yellow color of most pollen. Sporopollenin is unusually resistant to\nchemical and biological degradation. In seed plants, in which pollen is the male gametophyte, the toughness of sporopollenin\nexplains the existence of well-preserved pollen fossils. Sporopollenin was once thought to be an innovation of land plants;\nhowever, the charophyte Coleochaetes also forms spores that contain sporopollenin.\nGametangia in Seedless Plants\nGametangia (singular, gametangium) are structures observed on multicellular haploid gametophytes. In the gametangia,\nprecursor cells give rise to gametes by mitosis. The male gametangium (antheridium) releases sperm. Seedless plants produce\nsperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonium: the female gametangium.\nThe embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte. Gametangia are prominent in seedless plants, but are absent or\nrudimentary in seed plants.\nApical Meristems\nShoots and roots of plants increase in length through rapid cell division in a tissue called the apical meristem, which is a small\nmitotically active zone of cells found at the shoot tip or root tip (Figure 25.4). The apical meristem is made of undifferentiated\ncells that continue to proliferate throughout the life of the plant. Meristematic cells give rise to all the specialized tissues of the\norganism. Elongation of the shoots and roots allows a plant to access additional space and resources: light in the case of the\nshoot, and water and minerals in the case of roots. A separate meristem, called the lateral meristem, produces cells that increase\nthe diameter of tree trunks.\n644\nChapter 25 \u2022 Seedless Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 25.4 Apical meristem at a root tip. Addition of new cells in a root occurs at the apical meristem. Subsequent enlargement of these\ncells causes the organ to grow and elongate. The root cap protects the fragile apical meristem as the root tip is pushed through the soil by\ncell elongation.\nAdditional Land Plant Adaptations\nAs plants adapted to dry land and became independent from the constant presence of water in damp habitats, new organs and\nstructures made their appearance. Early land plants did not grow more than a few inches off the ground, competing for light on\nthese low mats. By developing a shoot and growing taller, individual plants captured more light. Because air offers substantially\nless support than water, land plants incorporated more rigid molecules in their stems (and later, tree trunks). In small plants\nsuch as single-celled algae, simple diffusion suffices to distribute water and nutrients throughout the organism. However, for\nplants to evolve larger forms, the evolution of a conductive tissue for the distribution of water and solutes was a prerequisite.\nThe evolution of vascular tissue in plants met both of these needs. The vascular system contains two types of conductive tissue:\nxylem and phloem. Xylem conducts water and minerals absorbed from the soil up to the shoot, while phloem transports food\nderived from photosynthesis throughout the entire plant. In xylem, the cells walls are reinforced with lignin, whose tough\nhydrophobic polymers help prevent the seepage of water across the xylem cell walls. Lignin also adds to the strength of these\ntissues in supporting the plant. The vascular tissues extend into the root of land plants. The root system evolved to take up water\nand minerals from the soil, and to anchor the increasingly taller shoot in the soil.\nIn land plants, a waxy, waterproof cover called a cuticle protects the leaves and stems from desiccation. However, the cuticle also\nprevents intake of carbon dioxide needed for the synthesis of carbohydrates through photosynthesis. To overcome this, stomata\nor pores that open and close to regulate traffic of gases and water vapor appeared in plants as they moved away from moist\nenvironments into drier habitats.\nWater filters ultraviolet-B (UVB) light, which is harmful to all organisms, especially those that must absorb light to survive. This\nfiltering does not occur for land plants. Exposure to damaging radiation presented an additional challenge to land colonization,\nwhich was met by the evolution of biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of protective flavonoids and other pigments that\nabsorb UV wavelengths of light and protect the aerial parts of plants from photodynamic damage.\nPlants cannot avoid being eaten by animals. Instead, they synthesize a large range of poisonous secondary metabolites: complex\norganic molecules such as alkaloids, whose noxious smells and unpleasant taste deter animals. These toxic compounds can also\ncause severe diseases and even death, thus discouraging predation. Humans have used many of these compounds for centuries\nas drugs, medications, or spices. In contrast, as plants co-evolved with animals, the development of sweet and nutritious\nmetabolites lured animals into providing valuable assistance in dispersing pollen grains, fruit, or seeds. Plants have been\nenlisting animals to be their helpers in this way for hundreds of millions of years.\nEvolution of Land Plants\nNo discussion of the evolution of plants on land can be undertaken without a brief review of the timeline of the geological eras.\nThe early era, known as the Paleozoic, is divided into six periods. It starts with the Cambrian period, followed by the Ordovician,\nSilurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian. The major event to mark the Ordovician, more than 500 million years ago, was\nthe colonization of land by the ancestors of modern land plants. Fossilized cells, cuticles, and spores of early land plants have\n25.1 \u2022 Early Plant Life\n645\nbeen dated as far back as the Ordovician period in the early Paleozoic era. The oldest-known vascular plants have been identified\nin deposits from the Devonian. One of the richest sources of information is the Rhynie chert, a sedimentary rock deposit found\nin Rhynie, Scotland (Figure 25.5), where embedded fossils of some of the earliest vascular plants have been identified.\nFigure 25.5 Early vascular plant fossils. This Rhynie chert (a) contains fossilized material from vascular plants. Reconstruction of Cooksonia\n(b), the plant forms inside the circle. (credit b: modification of work by Peter Coxhead based on original image by \u201cSmith609\u201d/Wikimedia\nCommons; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nPaleobotanists distinguish between extinct species, as fossils, and extant species, which are still living. The extinct vascular\nplants most probably lacked true leaves and roots and formed low vegetation mats similar in size to modern-day mosses,\nalthough some could reach one meter in height. The later genus Cooksonia, which flourished during the Silurian, has been\nextensively studied from well-preserved examples. Imprints of Cooksonia show slender branching stems ending in what appear\nto be sporangia. From the recovered specimens, it is not possible to establish for certain whether Cooksonia possessed vascular\ntissues. Fossils indicate that by the end of the Devonian period, ferns, horsetails, and seed plants populated the landscape,\ngiving rising to trees and forests. This luxuriant vegetation helped enrich the atmosphere with oxygen, making it easier for air-\nbreathing animals to colonize dry land. Plants also established early symbiotic relationships with fungi, creating mycorrhizae: a\nrelationship in which the fungal network of filaments increases the efficiency of the plant root system, and the plants provide\nthe fungi with byproducts of photosynthesis.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nPaleobotanist\nHow organisms acquired traits that allow them to colonize new environments\u2014and how the contemporary ecosystem is\nshaped\u2014are fundamental questions of evolution. Paleobotany (the study of extinct plants) addresses these questions through\nthe analysis of fossilized specimens retrieved from field studies, reconstituting the morphology of organisms that disappeared\nlong ago. Paleobotanists trace the evolution of plants by following the modifications in plant morphology: shedding light on the\nconnection between existing plants by identifying common ancestors that display the same traits. This field seeks to find\ntransitional species that bridge gaps in the path to the development of modern organisms. Fossils are formed when organisms\nare trapped in sediments or environments where their shapes are preserved. Paleobotanists collect fossil specimens in the field\nand place them in the context of the geological sediments and other fossilized organisms surrounding them. The activity\nrequires great care to preserve the integrity of the delicate fossils and the layers of rock in which they are found.\nOne of the most exciting recent developments in paleobotany is the use of analytical chemistry and molecular biology to study\nfossils. Preservation of molecular structures requires an environment free of oxygen, since oxidation and degradation of\nmaterial through the activity of microorganisms depend on its presence. One example of the use of analytical chemistry and\n646\nChapter 25 \u2022 Seedless Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nmolecular biology is the identification of oleanane, a compound that deters pests. Up to this point, oleanane appeared to be\nunique to flowering plants; however, it has now been recovered from sediments dating from the Permian, much earlier than the\ncurrent dates given for the appearance of the first flowering plants. Paleobotanists can also study fossil DNA, which can yield a\nlarge amount of information, by analyzing and comparing the DNA sequences of extinct plants with those of living and related\norganisms. Through this analysis, evolutionary relationships can be built for plant lineages.\nSome paleobotanists are skeptical of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of molecular fossils. For example, the chemical\nmaterials of interest degrade rapidly when exposed to air during their initial isolation, as well as in further manipulations. There\nis always a high risk of contaminating the specimens with extraneous material, mostly from microorganisms. Nevertheless, as\ntechnology is refined, the analysis of DNA from fossilized plants will provide invaluable information on the evolution of plants\nand their adaptation to an ever-changing environment.\nThe Major Divisions of Land Plants\nThe green algae and land plants are grouped together into a subphylum called the Streptophyta, and thus are called\nStreptophytes. In a further division, land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of\nvascular tissue, as detailed in Figure 25.6. Plants that lack vascular tissue, which is formed of specialized cells for the transport\nof water and nutrients, are referred to as non-vascular plants. Liverworts, mosses, and hornworts are seedless, non-vascular\nplants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution. Vascular plants developed a network of cells that conduct water and\nsolutes. The first vascular plants appeared in the late Ordovician (500 to 435 MYA) and were probably similar to lycophytes, which\ninclude club mosses (not to be confused with the mosses) and the pterophytes (ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns). Lycophytes\nand pterophytes are referred to as seedless vascular plants, because they do not produce seeds. The seed plants, or\nspermatophytes, form the largest group of all existing plants, and hence dominate the landscape. Seed plants include\ngymnosperms, most notably conifers, which produce \u201cnaked seeds,\u201d and the most successful of all plants, the flowering plants\n(angiosperms). Angiosperms protect their seeds inside chambers at the center of a flower; the walls of the chamber later develop\ninto a fruit.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 25.6 Streptophytes.

The brown and golden algae,\nhowever, are now reassigned to the protist supergroup Chromalveolata. This is because apart from their ability to capture light\nenergy and fix CO2, they lack many structural and biochemical traits that are characteristic of plants. The plants are now\nclassified, along with the red and green algae, in the protist supergroup Archaeplastida. Green algae contain the same\ncarotenoids and chlorophyll a and b as land plants, whereas other algae have different accessory pigments and types of\nchlorophyll molecules in addition to chlorophyll a. Both green algae and land plants also store carbohydrates as starch. Their\ncells contain chloroplasts that display a dizzying variety of shapes, and their cell walls contain cellulose, as do land plants. Which\nof the green algae to include among the plants has not been phylogenetically resolved.\nGreen algae fall into two major groups, the chlorophytes and the charophytes. The chlorophytes include the genera Chlorella,\nChlamydomonas, the \u201csea lettuce\u201d Ulva, and the colonial alga Volvox. The charophytes include desmids, as well as the genera\nSpirogyra, Coleochaete, and Chara. There are familiar green algae in both groups. Some green algae are single cells, such as\nChlamydomonas and desmids, which adds to the ambiguity of green algae classification, because plants are multicellular. Other\ngreen algae, like Volvox, form colonies, and some, like Ulva are multicellular (Figure 25.7). Spirogyra is a long filament of colonial\ncells. Most members of this genus live in fresh water, brackish water, seawater, or even in snow patches. A few green algae can\nsurvive on soil, provided it is covered by a thin film of moisture within which they can live. Periodic dry spells provide a selective\nadvantage to algae that can survive water stress.\n648\nChapter 25 \u2022 Seedless Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 25.7 Green algae. Charophyta include (a) Spirogyra and (b) desmids. Chlorophyta include (c) Chlamydomonas, and (d) Ulva. Desmids\nand Chlamydomonas are single-celled organisms, Spirogyra forms chains of cells, and Ulva forms multicellular structures resembling\nleaves, although the cells are not differentiated as they are in higher plants (credit b: modification of work by Derek Keats; credit c:\nmodification of work by Dartmouth Electron Microscope Facility, Dartmouth College; credit d: modification of work by Holger Krisp; scale-\nbar data from Matt Russell)\nThe chlorophytes and the charophytes differ in a few respects that, in addition to molecular analysis, place the land plants as a\nsister group of the charophytes. First, cells in charophytes and the land plants divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts, in\nwhich microtubules parallel to the spindle serve as guides for the vesicles of the forming cell plate. In the chlorophytes, the cell\nplate is organized by a phycoplast, in which the microtubules are perpendicular to the spindle. Second, only the charophytes and\nthe land plants have plasmodesmata, or intercellular channels that allow the transfer of materials from cell to cell. In the\nchlorophytes, intercellular connections do not persist in mature multicellular forms. Finally, both charophytes and the land\nplants show apical growth\u2014growth from the tips of the plant rather than throughout the plant body. Consequently, land plants\nand the charophytes are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta.\nReproduction of Green Algae\nGreen algae reproduce both asexually, by fragmentation or dispersal of spores, or sexually, by producing gametes that fuse\nduring fertilization. In a single-celled organism such as Chlamydomonas, there is no mitosis after fertilization. In the\nmulticellular Ulva, a sporophyte grows by mitosis after fertilization (and thus exhibits alternation of generations). Both\nChlamydomonas and Ulva produce flagellated gametes.\nCharophytes\nThe charophytes include several different algal orders that have each been suggested to be the closest relatives of the land plants:\nthe Charales, the Zygnematales, and the Coleochaetales. The Charales can be traced back 420 million years. They live in a range\nof freshwater habitats and vary in size from a few millimeters to a meter in length. The representative genus is Chara (Figure\n25.2 \u2022 Green Algae: Precursors of Land Plants\n649\n25.8), often called muskgrass or skunkweed because of its unpleasant smell. Large cells form the thallus: the main stem of the\nalga. Branches arising from the nodes are made of smaller cells. Male and female reproductive structures are found on the\nnodes, and the sperm have flagella. Although Chara looks superficially like some land plants, a major difference is that the stem\nhas no supportive tissue. However, the Charales exhibit a number of traits that are significant for adaptation to land life. They\nproduce the compounds lignin and sporopollenin, and form plasmodesmata that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells.\nAlthough the life cycle of the Charales is haplontic (the main form is haploid, and diploid zygotes are formed but have a brief\nexistence), the egg, and later, the zygote, form in a protected chamber on the haploid parent plant.\nFigure 25.8 Chara. The representative alga, Chara, is a noxious weed in Florida, where it clogs waterways. (credit: South Florida\nInformation Access, U.S. Geological Survey)\nThe Coleochaetes are branched or disclike multicellular forms. They can produce both sexually and asexually, but the life cycle is\nbasically haplontic. Recent extensive DNA sequence analysis of charophytes indicates that the Zygnematales are more closely\nrelated to the embryophytes than the Charales or the Coleochaetales. The Zygnematales include the familiar genus Spirogyra, as\nwell as the desmids. As techniques in DNA analysis improve and new information on comparative genomics arises, the\nphylogenetic connections between the charophytes and the land plants will continued to be examined to produce a satisfactory\nsolution to the mystery of the origin of land plants.\n25.3 Bryophytes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nIdentify the main characteristics of bryophytes\n\u2022\nDescribe the distinguishing traits of liverworts, hornworts, and mosses\n\u2022\nChart the development of land adaptations in the bryophytes\n\u2022\nDescribe the events in the bryophyte lifecycle\nBryophytes are the closest extant relatives of early terrestrial plants. The first bryophytes (liverworts) most likely appeared in the\nOrdovician period, about 450 million years ago. Because they lack lignin and other resistant structures, the likelihood of\nbryophytes forming fossils is rather small. Some spores protected by sporopollenin have survived and are attributed to early\nbryophytes. By the Silurian period (435 MYA), however, vascular plants had spread through the continents. This compelling fact\nis used as evidence that non-vascular plants must have preceded the Silurian period.\nMore than 25,000 species of bryophytes thrive in mostly damp habitats, although some live in deserts. They constitute the major\nflora of inhospitable environments like the tundra, where their small size and tolerance to desiccation offer distinct advantages.\nThey generally lack lignin and do not have actual tracheids (xylem cells specialized for water conduction). Rather, water and\nnutrients circulate inside specialized conducting cells. Although the term non-tracheophyte is more accurate, bryophytes are\ncommonly called non-vascular plants.\nIn a bryophyte, all the conspicuous vegetative organs\u2014including the photosynthetic leaf-like structures, the thallus (\u201cplant\nbody\u201d), stem, and the rhizoid that anchors the plant to its substrate\u2014belong to the haploid organism or gametophyte. The male\ngametes formed by bryophytes swim with a flagellum, so fertilization is dependent on the presence of water. The bryophyte\n650\nChapter 25 \u2022 Seedless Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nembryo also remains attached to the parent plant, which protects and nourishes it. The sporophyte that develops from the\nembryo is barely noticeable. The sporangium\u2014the multicellular sexual reproductive structure in which meiosis produces\nhaploid spores\u2014is present in bryophytes and absent in the majority of algae. This is also a characteristic of land plants.\nThe bryophytes are divided into three phyla: the liverworts or Marchantiophyta, the hornworts or Anthocerotophyta, and the\nmosses or true Bryophyta.\nLiverworts\nLiverworts (Marchantiophyta) are currently classified as the plants most closely related to the ancestor of vascular plants that\nadapted to terrestrial environments. In fact, liverworts have colonized every terrestrial habitat on Earth and diversified to more\nthan 7000 existing species (Figure 25.9). Lobate liverworts form a flat thallus, with lobes that have a vague resemblance to the\nlobes of the liver (Figure 25.10), which accounts for the name given to the phylum. Leafy liverworts have tiny leaflike structures\nattached to a stalk. Several leafy liverworts are shown in Figure 25.9.\nFigure 25.9 Liverworts. This 1904 drawing shows the variety of forms of Marchantiophyta.\n25.3 \u2022 Bryophytes\n651\nFigure 25.10 Liverwort gametophyte. A liverwort, Lunularia cruciata, displays its lobate, flat thallus. The organism in the photograph is in\nthe gametophyte stage, but has not yet produced gametangia. Lunularia gametophytes produce crescent-shaped gemmae (circled), which\ncontain asexual spores. The tiny white dots on the surface of the thallus are air pores.\nOpenings in the thallus that allow the movement of gases may be observed in liverworts (Figure 25.10). However, these are not\nstomata, because they do not actively open and close by the action of guard cells. Instead, the thallus takes up water over its\nentire surface and has no cuticle to prevent desiccation, which explains their preferred wet habitats. Figure 25.11 represents the\nlifecycle of a lobate liverwort. Haploid spores germinate into flattened thalli attached to the substrate by thin, single-celled\nfilaments. Stalk-like structures (gametophores) grow from the thallus and carry male and female gametangia, which may\ndevelop on separate, individual plants, or on the same plant, depending on the species. Flagellated male gametes develop within\nantheridia (male gametangia). The female gametes develop within archegonia (female gametangia). Once released, the male\ngametes swim with the aid of their flagella to an archegonium, and fertilization ensues. The zygote grows into a small\nsporophyte still contained in the archegonium. The diploid zygote will give rise, by meiosis, to the next generation of haploid\nspores, which can be disseminated by wind or water. In many liverworts, spore dispersal is facilitated by elaters\u2014long single\ncells that suddenly change shape as they dry out and throw adjacent spores out of the spore capsule. Liverwort plants can also\nreproduce asexually, by the breaking of \u201cbranches\u201d or the spreading of leaf fragments called gemmae. In this latter type of\nreproduction, the gemmae\u2014small, intact, complete pieces of plant that are produced in a cup on the surface of the thallus\n(shown in Figure 25.11 and Figure 25.12)\u2014are splashed out of the cup by raindrops. The gemmae then land nearby and develop\ninto gametophytes.\n652\nChapter 25 \u2022 Seedless Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 25.11 Reproductive cycle of liverworts. The life cycle of a typical lobate liverwort is shown. This image shows a liverwort in which\nantheridia and archegonia are produced on separate gametophytes. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nHornworts\nThe defining characteristic of the hornworts (Anthocerotophyta) is the narrow, pipe-like sporophyte. Hornworts have colonized\na variety of habitats on land, although they are never far from a source of moisture. The short, blue-green gametophyte is the\ndominant phase of the life cycle of a hornwort. The sporophytes emerge from the parent gametophyte and continue to grow\nthroughout the life of the plant (Figure 25.12).\nFigure 25.12 Hornwort sporophytes. Hornworts grow a tall and slender sporophyte. (credit: modification of work by Jason Hollinger)\nStomata (air pores that can be opened and closed) appear in the hornworts and are abundant on the sporophyte. Photosynthetic\ncells in the thallus each contain a single chloroplast. Meristem cells at the base of the plant keep dividing and adding to the\nheight of the sporophyte. This growth pattern is unique to the hornworts. Many hornworts establish symbiotic relationships\n25.3 \u2022 Bryophytes\n653\nwith cyanobacteria that fix nitrogen from the environment.\nThe lifecycle of hornworts (Figure 25.13) follows the general pattern of alternation of generations. The gametophytes grow as flat\nthalli on the soil with embedded male and female gametangia. Flagellated sperm swim to the archegonia and fertilize eggs. The\nzygote develops into a long and slender sporophyte that eventually splits open down the side, releasing spores. Thin branched\ncells called pseudoelaters surround the spores and help propel them farther in the environment. The haploid spores germinate\nand give rise to the next generation of gametophytes.\nFigure 25.13 Reproductive cycle of hornworts. The alternation of generation in hornworts is shown. (credit: modification of work by\n\u201cSmith609\u201d/Wikimedia Commons based on original work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nMosses\nThe mosses are the most numerous of the non-vascular plants. More than 10,000 species of mosses have been catalogued. Their\nhabitats vary from the tundra, where they are the main vegetation, to the understory of tropical forests. In the tundra, the\nmosses\u2019 shallow rhizoids allow them to fasten to a substrate without penetrating the frozen soil. Mosses slow down erosion,\nstore moisture and soil nutrients, and provide shelter for small animals as well as food for larger herbivores, such as the musk\nox. Mosses are very sensitive to air pollution and are used to monitor air quality. They are also sensitive to copper salts, so these\nsalts are a common ingredient of compounds marketed to eliminate mosses from lawns.\nMosses form diminutive gametophytes, which are the dominant phase of the lifecycle. Green, flat structures with a simple\nmidrib\u2014resembling true leaves, but lacking stomata and vascular tissue\u2014are attached in a spiral to a central stalk. Mosses have\nstomata only on the sporophyte. Water and nutrients are absorbed directly through the leaflike structures of the gametophyte.\nSome mosses have small branches. A primitive conductive system that carries water and nutrients runs up the gametophyte's\nstalk, but does not extend into the leaves. Additionally, mosses are anchored to the substrate\u2014whether it is soil, rock, or roof\ntiles\u2014by multicellular rhizoids, precursors of roots. They originate from the base of the gametophyte, but are not the major\nroute for the absorption of water and minerals. The lack of a true root system explains why it is so easy to rip moss mats from a\ntree trunk. The mosses therefore occupy a threshold position between other bryophytes and the vascular plants.\nThe moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in Figure 25.14. The most familiar structure is the\nhaploid gametophyte, which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a protonema\u2014usually, a tangle of single-celled\nfilaments that hug the ground. Cells akin to an apical meristem actively divide and give rise to a gametophore, consisting of a\nphotosynthetic stem and foliage-like structures. Male and female gametangia develop at the tip of separate gametophores. The\n654\nChapter 25 \u2022 Seedless Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nantheridia (male organs) produce many sperm, whereas the archegonia (the female organs) each form a single egg at the base\n(venter) of a flask-shaped structure. The archegonium produces attractant substances and at fertilization, the sperm swims\ndown the neck to the venter and unites with the egg inside the archegonium. The zygote, protected by the archegonium, divides\nand grows into a sporophyte, still attached by its foot to the gametophyte.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 25.14 Reproductive cycle of mosses. This illustration shows the life cycle of mosses.

The slender seta (plural, setae), as seen in Figure 25.15,\n25.3 \u2022 Bryophytes\n655\ncontains tubular cells that transfer nutrients from the base of the sporophyte (the foot) to the sporangium or capsule.\nFigure 25.15 Moss sporophyte. This photograph shows the long slender stems, called setae, connected to capsules of the moss\nThamnobryum alopecurum. The operculum and remnants of the calyptra are visible in some capsules. (credit: modification of work by\nHermann Schachner)\nSpore mother cells in the sporangium undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores. The sporophyte has several features that\nprotect the developing spores and aid in their dispersal. The calyptra, derived from the walls of the archegonium, covers the\nsporangium. A structure called the operculum is at the tip of the spore capsule. The calyptra and operculum fall off when the\nspores are ready for dispersal. The peristome, tissue around the mouth of the capsule, is made of triangular, close-fitting units\nlike little \u201cteeth.\u201d The peristome opens and closes, depending on moisture levels, and periodically releases spores.\n25.4 Seedless Vascular Plants\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nIdentify the new traits that first appear in seedless tracheophytes\n\u2022\nDiscuss how each trait is important for adaptation to life on land\n\u2022\nIdentify the classes of seedless tracheophytes\n\u2022\nDescribe the life cycle of a fern\n\u2022\nExplain the role of seedless plants in the ecosystem\nThe vascular plants, or tracheophytes, are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants. More than 260,000 species\nof tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of Earth\u2019s vegetation. Several evolutionary innovations explain their success\nand their ability to spread to all habitats.\nBryophytes may have been successful at the transition from an aquatic habitat to land, but they are still dependent on water for\nreproduction, and must absorb moisture and nutrients through the gametophyte surface. The lack of roots for absorbing water\nand minerals from the soil, as well as a lack of lignin-reinforced conducting cells, limit bryophytes to small sizes. Although they\nmay survive in reasonably dry conditions, they cannot reproduce and expand their habitat range in the absence of water.\nVascular plants, on the other hand, can achieve enormous heights, thus competing successfully for light. Photosynthetic organs\nbecome leaves, and pipe-like cells or vascular tissues transport water, minerals, and fixed carbon organic compounds\nthroughout the organism.\nThroughout plant evolution, there is a progressive increase in the dominance of the sporophyte generation. In seedless vascular\nplants, the diploid sporophyte is the dominant phase of the life cycle. The gametophyte is now less conspicuous, but still\nindependent of the sporophyte. Seedless vascular plants still depend on water during fertilization, as the flagellated sperm must\nswim on a layer of moisture to reach the egg. This step in reproduction explains why ferns and their relatives are more abundant\nin damp environments.\nVascular Tissue: Xylem and Phloem\nThe first plant fossils that show the presence of vascular tissue date to the Silurian period, about 430 million years ago. The\nsimplest arrangement of conductive cells shows a pattern of xylem at the center surrounded by phloem. Xylem is the tissue\nresponsible for the storage and long-distance transport of water and nutrients, as well as the transfer of water-soluble growth\n656\nChapter 25 \u2022 Seedless Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nfactors from the organs of synthesis to the target organs. The tissue consists of conducting cells, known as tracheids, and\nsupportive filler tissue, called parenchyma. Xylem conductive cells incorporate the compound lignin into their walls, and are\nthus described as lignified. Lignin itself is a complex polymer: It is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength on\nvascular tissue. With their rigid cell walls, the xylem cells provide support to the plant and allow it to achieve impressive heights.\nTall plants have a selective advantage by being able to reach unfiltered sunlight and disperse their spores or seeds away from the\nparent plant, thus expanding the species\u2019 range. By growing higher than other plants, tall trees cast their shadows on shorter\nplants and thereby outcompete them for water and precious nutrients in the soil.\nPhloem is the second type of vascular tissue; it transports sugars, proteins, and other solutes throughout the plant. Phloem cells\nare divided into sieve elements (conducting cells) and cells that support the sieve elements. Together, xylem and phloem tissues\nform the vascular system of plants (Figure 25.16).\nFigure 25.16 Vascular bundles in celery. This cross section of a celery stalk shows a number of vascular bundles. The xylem is on the inner\npart of each bundle.

Image modified from source.)\nRoots: Support for the Plant\nRoots are not well-preserved in the fossil record. Nevertheless, it seems that roots appeared later in evolution than vascular\ntissue. The development of an extensive network of roots represented a significant new feature of vascular plants. Thin rhizoids\nattached bryophytes to the substrate, but these rather flimsy filaments did not provide a strong anchor for the plant; nor did\nthey absorb substantial amounts of water and nutrients. In contrast, roots, with their prominent vascular tissue system,\ntransfer water and minerals from the soil to the rest of the plant. The extensive network of roots that penetrates deep into the\nsoil to reach sources of water also stabilizes plants by acting as a ballast or anchor. The majority of roots establish a symbiotic\nrelationship with fungi, forming mutualistic mycorrhizae, which benefit the plant by greatly increasing the surface area for\nabsorption of water, soil minerals, and nutrients.\nLeaves, Sporophylls, and Strobili\nA third innovation marks the seedless vascular plants. Accompanying the prominence of the sporophyte and the development of\nvascular tissue, the appearance of true leaves improved their photosynthetic efficiency. Leaves capture more sunlight with their\nincreased surface area by employing more chloroplasts to trap light energy and convert it to chemical energy, which is then used\nto fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. The carbohydrates are exported to the rest of the plant by the conductive\ncells of phloem tissue.\n25.4 \u2022 Seedless Vascular Plants\n657\nThe existence of two types of leaf morphology\u2014microphylls and megaphylls\u2014suggests that leaves evolved independently in\nseveral groups of plants. Microphylls (\"little leaves\") are small and have a simple vascular system. The first microphylls in the\nfossil record can be dated to 350 million years ago in the late Silurian. A single unbranched vein\u2014a bundle of vascular tissue\nmade of xylem and phloem\u2014runs through the center of the leaf. Microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral\nbranches, or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities. Microphylls are seen in club mosses. Microphylls probably\npreceded the development of megaphylls (\"big leaves\"), which are larger leaves with a pattern of multiple veins. Megaphylls most\nlikely appeared independently several times during the course of evolution. Their complex networks of veins suggest that several\nbranches may have combined into a flattened organ, with the gaps between the branches being filled with photosynthetic tissue.\nMegaphylls are seen in ferns and more derived vascular plants.\nIn addition to photosynthesis, leaves play another role in the life of the plants. Pine cones, mature fronds of ferns, and flowers\nare all sporophylls\u2014leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia. In conifers, the commonly named pine cones,\nstrobili are cone-like structures that contain sporangia.\nFerns and Other Seedless Vascular Plants\nBy the late Devonian period, plants had evolved vascular tissue, well-defined leaves, and root systems. With these advantages,\nplants increased in height and size. During the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 MYA), swamp forests of club mosses and\nhorsetails\u2014some specimens reaching heights of more than 30 m (100 ft)\u2014covered most of the land. These forests gave rise to\nthe extensive coal deposits that gave the Carboniferous its name. In seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte became the\ndominant phase of the life cycle.\nWater is still required as a medium of sperm transport during the fertilization of seedless vascular plants, and most favor a\nmoist environment. Modern-day seedless tracheophytes include club mosses, horsetails, ferns, and whisk ferns.\nPhylum Lycopodiophyta: Club Mosses\nThe club mosses, or phylum Lycopodiophyta, are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants. They dominated the landscape of\nthe Carboniferous, growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests. Today\u2019s club mosses are diminutive, evergreen\nplants consisting of a stem (which may be branched) and microphylls (Figure 25.17). The phylum Lycopodiophyta consists of\nclose to 1,200 species, including the quillworts (Isoetales), the club mosses (Lycopodiales), and spike mosses (Selaginellales),\nnone of which are true mosses or bryophytes.\nLycophytes follow the pattern of alternation of generations seen in the bryophytes, except that the sporophyte is the major stage\nof the life cycle. Some lycophytes, like the club moss Lycopodium, produce gametophytes that are independent of the\nsporophyte, developing underground or in other locations where they can form mycorrhizal associations with fungi. In many\nclub mosses, the sporophyte gives rise to sporophylls arranged in strobili, cone-like structures that give the class its name.\nSporangia develop within the chamber formed by each sporophyll.\nLycophytes can be homosporous (spores of the same size) or heterosporous (spores of different sizes). The spike moss Selaginella\nis a heterosporous lycophyte. The same strobilus will contain microsporangia, which produce spores that will develop into the\nmale gametophyte, and megasporangia, which produce spores that will develop into the female gametophyte. Both\ngametophytes develop within the protective strobilus.\n658\nChapter 25 \u2022 Seedless Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 25.17 Lycopodium. In the club mosses such as Lycopodium clavatum, sporangia are arranged in clusters called strobili. The generic\nname means \"wolf-foot\" from the resemblance of the branched sporophyte to a paw. The specific epithet clavatum refers to the club-\nshaped strobilus, and reflects the common name of the phylum. (credit: Cory Zanker)\nPhylum Monilophyta: Class Equisetopsida (Horsetails)\nHorsetails, whisk ferns, and ferns belong to the phylum Monilophyta, with horsetails placed in the class Equisetopsida. The\nsingle genus Equisetum is the survivor of a large group of plants, known as Arthrophyta, which produced large trees and entire\nswamp forests in the Carboniferous. The plants are usually found in damp environments and marshes (Figure 25.18).\nFigure 25.18 Horsetails. Horsetails, named for the brushy appearance of the sporophyte, thrive in a marsh. (credit: Myriam Feldman)\nThe stem of a horsetail is characterized by the presence of joints or nodes, hence the name Arthrophyta (arthro- = \"joint\"; -phyta\n= \"plant\"). Leaves and branches come out as whorls from the evenly spaced joints. The needle-shaped leaves do not contribute\ngreatly to photosynthesis, the majority of which takes place in the green stem (Figure 25.19).\n25.4 \u2022 Seedless Vascular Plants\n659\nFigure 25.19 The jointed stem of a horsetail. Thin leaves originating at the joints are noticeable on the horsetail plant. Because silica\ndeposited in the cell walls made these plants abrasive, horsetails were once used as scrubbing brushes and were nicknamed scouring\nrushes. (credit: Myriam Feldman)\nSilica collected by in the epidermal cells contributes to the stiffness of horsetail plants, but underground stems known as\nrhizomes anchor the plants to the ground. Modern-day horsetails are homosporous. The spores are attached to elaters\u2014as we\nhave seen, these are coiled threads that spring open in dry weather and casts the spores to a location distant from the parent\nplants. The spores then germinate to produce small bisexual gametophytes.\nPhylum Monilophyta: Class Psilotopsida (Whisk Ferns)\nWhile most ferns form large leaves and branching roots, the whisk ferns, class Psilotopsida, lack both roots and leaves, probably\nlost by reduction. Photosynthesis takes place in their green stems, which branch dichotomously. Small yellow knobs form at the\ntip of a branch or at branch nodes and contain the sporangia (Figure 25.20). Spores develop into gametophytes that are only a\nfew millimeters across, but which produce both male and female gametangia. Whisk ferns were considered early pterophytes.\nHowever, recent comparative DNA analysis suggests that this group may have lost both vascular tissue and roots through\nevolution, and is more closely related to ferns.\nFigure 25.20 Psilotum. The whisk fern Psilotum nudum has conspicuous green stems with knob-shaped sporangia.

They are also\nconsidered to be the most advanced seedless vascular plants and display characteristics commonly observed in seed plants.\nMore than 20,000 species of ferns live in environments ranging from the tropics to temperate forests. Although some species\nsurvive in dry environments, most ferns are restricted to moist, shaded places. Ferns made their appearance in the fossil record\nduring the Devonian period (420 MYA) and expanded during the Carboniferous (360 to 300 MYA).\nThe dominant stage of the life cycle of a fern is the sporophyte, which consists of large compound leaves called fronds. Fronds\nmay be either finely divided or broadly lobed. Fronds fulfill a double role; they are photosynthetic organs that also carry\nreproductive organs. The stem may be buried underground as a rhizome, from which adventitious roots grow to absorb water\nand nutrients from the soil; or, they may grow above ground as a trunk in tree ferns (Figure 25.21). Adventitious organs are those\nthat grow in unusual places, such as roots growing from the side of a stem.\nFigure 25.21 A tree fern. Some specimens of this short tree-fern species can grow very tall. (credit: Adrian Pingstone)\nThe tip of a developing fern frond is rolled into a crozier, or fiddlehead (Figure 25.22). Fiddleheads unroll as the frond develops.\nFigure 25.22 Fern fiddleheads. Croziers, or fiddleheads, are the tips of fern fronds. (credit a: modification of work by Cory Zanker; credit b:\nmodification of work by Myriam Feldman)\nOn the underside of each mature fern frond are groups of sporangia called sori (Figure 25.23a). Most ferns are homosporous.\nSpores are produced by meiosis and are released into the air from the sporangium. Those that land on a suitable substrate\ngerminate and form a heart-shaped gametophyte, or prothallus, which is attached to the ground by thin filamentous rhizoids\n(Figure 25.23b). Gametophytes produce both antheridia and archegonia. Like the sperm cells of other pterophytes, fern sperm\nhave multiple flagella and must swim to the archegonium, which releases a chemoattractant to guide them. The zygote develops\ninto a fern sporophyte, which emerges from the archegonium of the gametophyte. Maturation of antheridia and archegonia at\ndifferent times encourages cross-fertilization. The full life cycle of a fern is depicted in Figure 25.24.\n25.4 \u2022 Seedless Vascular Plants\n661\nFigure 25.23 Fern reproductive stages.

They were also familiar with the biology of\nthe plants they chose. Landscape design also has strong roots in the United States\u2019 tradition. A prime example of early American\nclassical design is Monticello, Thomas Jefferson\u2019s private estate. Among his many interests, Jefferson maintained a strong\npassion for botany. Landscape layout can encompass a small private space like a backyard garden, public gathering places such\nas Central Park in New York City, or an entire city plan like Pierre L\u2019Enfant\u2019s design for Washington, DC.\nA landscape designer will plan traditional public spaces\u2014such as botanical gardens, parks, college campuses, gardens, and\nlarger developments\u2014as well as natural areas and private gardens. The restoration of natural places encroached on by human\nintervention, such as wetlands, also requires the expertise of a landscape designer.\nWith such an array of necessary skills, a landscape designer\u2019s education should include a solid background in botany, soil\nscience, plant pathology, entomology, and horticulture. Coursework in architecture and design software is also required for the\ncompletion of the degree. The successful design of a landscape rests on an extensive knowledge of plant growth requirements\nsuch as light and shade, moisture levels, compatibility of different species, and susceptibility to pathogens and pests. Mosses\nand ferns will thrive in a shaded area, where fountains provide moisture; cacti, on the other hand, would not fare well in that\nenvironment. The future growth of individual plants must be taken into account, to avoid crowding and competition for light\nand nutrients. The appearance of the space over time is also of concern. Shapes, colors, and biology must be balanced for a well-\nmaintained and sustainable green space. Art, architecture, and biology blend in a beautifully designed and implemented\nlandscape (Figure 25.25).\nFigure 25.25 This landscaped border at a college campus was designed by students in the horticulture and landscaping department of the\ncollege. (credit: Myriam Feldman)\nThe Importance of Seedless Plants\nMosses and liverworts are often the first macroscopic organisms to colonize an area, both in a primary succession\u2014where bare\nland is settled for the first time by living organisms, or in a secondary succession\u2014where soil remains intact after a catastrophic\nevent wipes out many existing species. Their spores are carried by the wind, birds, or insects. Once mosses and liverworts are\nestablished, they provide food and shelter for other plant species. In a hostile environment, like the tundra where the soil is\nfrozen, bryophytes grow well because they do not have roots and can dry and rehydrate quickly once water is again available.\nMosses are at the base of the food chain in the tundra biome. Many species\u2014from small herbivorous insects to musk oxen and\nreindeer\u2014depend on mosses for food. In turn, predators feed on the herbivores, which are the primary consumers. Some\nreports indicate that bryophytes make the soil more amenable to colonization by other plants. Because they establish symbiotic\nrelationships with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, mosses replenish the soil with nitrogen.\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, scientists had observed that lichens and mosses were becoming increasingly rare in urban\n25.4 \u2022 Seedless Vascular Plants\n663\nand suburban areas. Because bryophytes have neither a root system for absorption of water and nutrients, nor a cuticular layer\nthat protects them from desiccation, pollutants in rainwater readily penetrate their tissues as they absorb moisture and\nnutrients through their entire exposed surfaces. Therefore, pollutants dissolved in rainwater penetrate plant tissues readily and\nhave a larger impact on mosses than on other plants. The disappearance of mosses can be considered a biological indicator for\nthe level of pollution in the environment.\nFerns contribute to the environment by promoting the weathering of rock, accelerating the formation of topsoil, and slowing\ndown erosion as rhizomes spread throughout the soil. The water ferns of the genus Azolla harbor nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria\nand restore this important nutrient to aquatic habitats.\nSeedless plants have historically played a role in human life with uses as tools, fuel, and medicine. For example, dried peat moss,\nSphagnum, is commonly used as fuel in some parts of Europe and is considered a renewable resource. Sphagnum bogs (Figure\n25.26) are cultivated with cranberry and blueberry bushes. In addition, the ability of Sphagnum to hold moisture makes the\nmoss a common soil conditioner. Even florists use blocks of Sphagnum to maintain moisture for floral arrangements!\nFigure 25.26 Sphagnum moss. Sphagnum acutifolium is dried peat moss and can be used as fuel. (credit: Ken Goulding)\nThe attractive fronds of ferns make them a favorite ornamental plant. Because they thrive in low light, they are well suited as\nhouse plants. More importantly, fiddleheads of bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) are a traditional spring food of Native\nAmericans, and are popular as a side dish in French cuisine. The licorice fern, Polypodium glycyrrhiza, is part of the diet of the\nPacific Northwest coastal tribes, owing in part to the sweetness of its rhizomes. It has a faint licorice taste and serves as a\nsweetener. The rhizome also figures in the pharmacopeia of Native Americans for its medicinal properties and is used as a\nremedy for sore throat.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGo to this website (http://openstax.org/l/fiddleheads) to learn how to identify fern species.\nBy far the greatest impact of seedless vascular plants on human life, however, comes from their extinct progenitors. The tall club\nmosses, horsetails, and tree-like ferns that flourished in the swampy forests of the Carboniferous period gave rise to large\ndeposits of coal throughout the world. Coal provided an abundant source of energy during the Industrial Revolution, which had\ntremendous consequences on human societies, including rapid technological progress and growth of large cities, as well as the\ndegradation of the environment. Coal is still a prime source of energy and also a major contributor to global warming.\n664\nChapter 25 \u2022 Seedless Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nadventitious\ndescribes an organ that grows in an unusual\nplace, such as a roots growing from the side of a stem\nantheridium\nmale gametangium\narchegonium\nfemale gametangium\ncapsule\ncase of the sporangium in mosses\ncharophyte\nother term for green algae; considered the\nclosest relative of land plants\nclub mosses\nearliest group of seedless vascular plants\ndiplontic\ndiploid stage is the dominant stage\nembryophyte\nother name for land plant; embryo is\nprotected and nourished by the sporophyte\nextant\nstill-living species\nextinct\nno-longer-existing species\nfern\nseedless vascular plant that produces large fronds; the\nmost advanced group of seedless vascular plants\ngametangium\nstructure on the gametophyte in which\ngametes are produced\ngemma\n(plural, gemmae) leaf fragment that spreads for\nasexual reproduction\nhaplodiplodontic\nhaploid and diploid stages alternate\nhaplontic\nhaploid stage is the dominant stage\nheterosporous\nproduces two types of spores\nhomosporous\nproduces one type of spore\nhornworts\ngroup of non-vascular plants in which stomata\nappear\nhorsetail\nseedless vascular plant characterized by joints\nlignin\ncomplex polymer impermeable to water\nliverworts\nmost primitive group of the non-vascular plants\nlycophyte\nclub moss\nmegaphyll\nlarger leaves with a pattern of branching veins\nmegaspore\nfemale spore\nmicrophyll\nsmall size and simple vascular system with a\nsingle unbranched vein\nmicrospore\nmale spore\nmosses\ngroup of bryophytes in which a primitive\nconductive system appears\nnon-vascular plant\nplant that lacks vascular tissue, which\nis formed of specialized cells for the transport of water\nand nutrients\npeat moss\nSphagnum\nperistome\ntissue that surrounds the opening of the capsule\nand allows periodic release of spores\nphloem\ntissue responsible for transport of sugars,\nproteins, and other solutes\nprotonema\ntangle of single-celled filaments that forms\nfrom the haploid spore\nrhizoids\nthin filaments that anchor the plant to the\nsubstrate\nseedless vascular plant\nplant that does not produce seeds\nseta\nstalk that supports the capsule in mosses\nsporocyte\ndiploid cell that produces spores by meiosis\nsporophyll\nleaf modified structurally to bear sporangia\nsporopollenin\ntough polymer surrounding the spore\nstreptophytes\ngroup that includes green algae and land\nplants\nstrobili\ncone-like structures that contain the sporangia\ntracheophyte\nvascular plant\nvascular plant\nplant containing a network of cells that\nconducts water and solutes through the organism\nvein\nbundle of vascular tissue made of xylem and phloem\nwhisk fern\nseedless vascular plant that lost roots and leaves\nby reduction\nxylem\ntissue responsible for long-distance transport of\nwater and nutrients\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n25.1 Early Plant Life\nLand plants acquired traits that made it possible to colonize\nland and survive out of the water. All land plants share the\nfollowing characteristics: alternation of generations, with\nthe haploid plant called a gametophyte, and the diploid plant\ncalled a sporophyte; formation of haploid spores in a\nsporangium; formation of gametes in a gametangium;\nprotection of the embryo; and an apical meristem. Vascular\ntissues, roots, leaves, cuticle cover, and a tough outer layer\nthat protects the spores contributed to the adaptation of\nplants to dry land. Land plants appeared about 500 million\nyears ago in the Ordovician period.\n25.2 Green Algae: Precursors of\nLand Plants\nCharophytes share more traits with land plants than do other\nalgae, according to structural features and DNA analysis.\nWithin the charophytes, the Charales, the Coleochaetales,\nand the Zygnematales have been each considered as sharing\nthe closest common ancestry with the land plants.\nCharophytes form sporopollenin and precursors of lignin,\nphragmoplasts, and have flagellated sperm. They do not\nexhibit alternation of generations.\n25.3 Bryophytes\nSeedless non-vascular plants are small, having the\ngametophyte as the dominant stage of the lifecycle. Without\na vascular system and roots, they absorb water and nutrients\non all their exposed surfaces. Collectively known as\nbryophytes, the three main groups include the liverworts,\nthe hornworts, and the mosses. Liverworts are the most\nprimitive plants and are closely related to the first land\nplants. Hornworts developed stomata and possess a single\nChapter 25 \u2022 Key Terms\n665\nchloroplast per cell. Mosses have simple conductive cells and\nare attached to the substrate by rhizoids. They colonize harsh\nhabitats and can regain moisture after drying out. The moss\nsporangium is a complex structure that allows release of\nspores away from the parent plant.\n25.4 Seedless Vascular Plants\nThe seedless vascular plants show several features important\nto living on land: vascular tissue, roots, and leaves. Vascular\nsystems consist of xylem tissue, which transports water and\nminerals, and phloem tissue, which transports sugars and\nproteins. With the development of the vascular system,\nleaves appeared to act as large photosynthetic organs, and\nroots to access water from the ground. Small uncomplicated\nleaves are termed microphylls. Large leaves with vein\npatterns are termed megaphylls. Modified leaves that bear\nsporangia are called sporophylls. Some sporophylls are\narranged in cone structures called strobili.\nThe support and conductive properties of vascular tissues\nhave allowed the sporophyte generation of vascular plants to\nbecome increasingly dominant. The seedless vascular plants\ninclude club mosses, which are the most primitive; whisk\nferns, which lost leaves and roots by reductive evolution; and\nhorsetails and ferns. Ferns are the most advanced group of\nseedless vascular plants. They are distinguished by large\nleaves called fronds and small sporangia-containing\nstructures called sori, which are found on the underside of\nthe fronds.\nBoth mosses and ferns play an essential role in the balance of\nthe ecosystems. Mosses are pioneering species that colonize\nbare or devastated environments and make it possible for\nsuccession to occur. They contribute to the enrichment of the\nsoil and provide shelter and nutrients for animals in hostile\nenvironments. Mosses are important biological indicators of\nenvironmental pollution. Ferns are important for providing\nnatural habitats, as soil stabilizers, and as decorative plants.\nBoth mosses and ferns are part of traditional medical\npractice. In addition to culinary, medical, and decorative\npurposes, mosses and ferns can be used as fuels, and ancient\nseedless plants were important contributors to the fossil fuel\ndeposits that we now use as an energy resource.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

These palms are seed plants, which have broken free from the need to rely on\nwater for their reproductive needs. The seed plants play an integral role in all aspects of life on the planet,\nshaping the physical terrain, influencing the climate, and maintaining life as we know it. For millennia,\nhuman societies have depended on seed plants for nutrition and medicinal compounds. Somewhat more\nrecently, seed plants have served as a source of manufactured products such as timber and paper, dyes,\nand textiles. As an example, multiple uses have been found for each of the plants shown above. Palms\nprovide materials including rattans, oils, and dates. Grains like wheat are grown to feed both human and\nanimal populations or fermented to produce alcoholic beverages. The fruit of the cotton flower is\nharvested as a boll, with its fibers transformed into clothing or pulp for paper. The showy opium poppy is\nvalued both as an ornamental flower and as a source of potent opiate compounds.\nChapter Outline\n26.1 Evolution of Seed\nPlants\n26.2 Gymnosperms\n26.3 Angiosperms\n26.4 The Role of Seed\nPlants\nThe first plants to colonize land were most likely related to the ancestors of modern day mosses (bryophytes),\nwhich are thought to have appeared about 500 million years ago. They were followed by liverworts (also\nbryophytes) and primitive vascular plants\u2014the pterophytes\u2014from which modern ferns are descended. The\nlife cycle of bryophytes and pterophytes is characterized by the alternation of generations, which is also\nexhibited in the gymnosperms and angiosperms. However, what sets bryophytes and pterophytes apart\nfrom gymnosperms and angiosperms is their reproductive requirement for water. The completion of the\nbryophyte and pterophyte life cycle requires water because the male gametophyte releases flagellated sperm,\nwhich must swim to reach and fertilize the female gamete or egg. After fertilization, the zygote undergoes\ncellular division and grows into a diploid sporophyte, which in turn will form sporangia or \"spore vessels.\" In\nthe sporangia, mother cells undergo meiosis and produce the haploid spores. Release of spores in a suitable\nenvironment will lead to germination and a new generation of gametophytes.\nIn seed plants, the evolutionary trend led to a dominant sporophyte generation accompanied by a\ncorresponding reduction in the size of the gametophyte from a conspicuous structure to a microscopic\ncluster of cells enclosed in the tissues of the sporophyte. Whereas lower vascular plants, such as club mosses\nand ferns, are mostly homosporous (producing only one type of spore), all seed plants, or spermatophytes,\nare heterosporous, producing two types of spores: megaspores (female) and microspores (male). Megaspores\ndevelop into female gametophytes that produce eggs, and microspores mature into male gametophytes that\ngenerate sperm. Because the gametophytes mature within the spores, they are not free-living, as are the\ngametophytes of other seedless vascular plants.\nAncestral heterosporous seedless plants, represented by modern-day plants such as the spike moss\nSelaginella, are seen as the evolutionary forerunners of seed plants. In the life cycle of Selaginella, both male\nand female sporangia develop within the same stem-like strobilus. In each male sporangium, multiple\nmicrospores are produced by meiosis. Each microspore produces a small antheridium contained within a\nspore case. As it develops it is released from the strobilus, and a number of flagellated sperm are produced\nthat then leave the spore case. In the female sporangium, a single megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis\nto produce four megaspores. Gametophytes develop within each megaspore, consisting of a mass of tissue\nthat will later nourish the embryo and a few archegonia. The female gametophyte may remain within\nremnants of the spore wall in the megasporangium until after fertilization has occurred and the embryo\nbegins to develop. This combination of an embryo and nutritional cells is a little different from the\norganization of a seed, since the nutritive endosperm in a seed is formed from a single cell rather than\nmultiple cells.\nBoth seeds and pollen distinguish seed plants from seedless vascular plants. These innovative structures\nallowed seed plants to reduce or eliminate their dependence on water for gamete fertilization and\ndevelopment of the embryo, and to conquer dry land. Pollen grains are male gametophytes, which contain\nthe sperm (gametes) of the plant. The small haploid (1n) cells are encased in a protective coat that prevents\ndesiccation (drying out) and mechanical damage. Pollen grains can travel far from their original sporophyte,\nspreading the plant\u2019s genes. Seeds offer the embryo protection, nourishment, and a mechanism to maintain\ndormancy for tens or even thousands of years, ensuring that germination can occur when growth conditions\nare optimal. Seeds therefore allow plants to disperse the next generation through both space and time. With\nsuch evolutionary advantages, seed plants have become the most successful and familiar group of plants.\nBoth adaptations expanded the colonization of land begun by the bryophytes and their ancestors. Fossils\nplace the earliest distinct seed plants at about 350 million years ago. The first reliable record of\ngymnosperms dates their appearance to the Pennsylvanian period, about 319 million years ago (Figure 26.2).\nGymnosperms were preceded by progymnosperms, the first naked seed plants, which arose about 380\nmillion years ago. Progymnosperms were a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers\n(cone bearers) because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues; however, they\nstill reproduced like ferns, releasing spores into the environment. At least some species were heterosporous.\nProgymnosperms, like the extinct Archaeopteris (not to be confused with the ancient bird Archaeopteryx),\ndominated the forests of the late Devonian period. However, by the early (Triassic, c. 240 MYA) and middle\n(Jurassic, c. 205 MYA) Mesozoic era, the landscape was dominated by the true gymnosperms. Angiosperms\nsurpassed gymnosperms by the middle of the Cretaceous (c. 100 MYA) in the late Mesozoic era, and today\n670\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nare the most abundant and biologically diverse plant group in most terrestrial biomes.\nFigure 26.2 Plant timeline.

Seed ferns (Figure 26.3) produced their seeds along their branches, in structures called\ncupules that enclosed and protected the ovule\u2014the female gametophyte and associated tissues\u2014which develops into a seed\nupon fertilization. Seed plants resembling modern tree ferns became more numerous and diverse in the coal swamps of the\nCarboniferous period.\nFigure 26.3 Seed fern leaf. This fossilized leaf is from Glossopteris, a seed fern that thrived during the Permian age (290\u2013240 million years\nago). (credit: D.L. Schmidt, USGS)\nFossil records indicate the first gymnosperms (progymnosperms) most likely originated in the Paleozoic era, during the middle\nDevonian period: about 390 million years ago. The previous Mississippian and Pennsylvanian periods, were wet and dominated\nby giant fern trees. But the following Permian period was dry, which gave a reproductive edge to seed plants, which are better\nadapted to survive dry spells. The Ginkgoales, a group of gymnosperms with only one surviving species\u2014the Ginkgo\nbiloba\u2014were the first gymnosperms to appear during the lower Jurassic. Gymnosperms expanded in the Mesozoic era (about\n240 million years ago), supplanting ferns in the landscape, and reaching their greatest diversity during this time. The Jurassic\nperiod was as much the age of the cycads (palm-tree-like gymnosperms) as the age of the dinosaurs. Ginkgoales and the more\nfamiliar conifers also dotted the landscape. Although angiosperms (flowering plants) are the major form of plant life in most\n26.1 \u2022 Evolution of Seed Plants\n671\nbiomes, gymnosperms still dominate some ecosystems, such as the taiga (boreal forests) and the alpine forests at higher\nmountain elevations (Figure 26.4) because of their adaptation to cold and dry growth conditions.\nFigure 26.4 Conifers. This boreal forest (taiga) has low-lying plants and conifer trees. (credit: L.B. Brubaker, NOAA)\nSeeds and Pollen as an Evolutionary Adaptation to Dry Land\nBryophyte and fern spores are haploid cells dependent on moisture for rapid development of multicellular gametophytes. In the\nseed plants, the female gametophyte consists of just a few cells: the egg and some supportive cells, including the endosperm-\nproducing cell that will support the growth of the embryo. After fertilization of the egg, the diploid zygote produces an embryo\nthat will grow into the sporophyte when the seed germinates. Storage tissue to sustain growth of the embryo and a protective\ncoat give seeds their superior evolutionary advantage. Several layers of hardened tissue prevent desiccation, and free the embryo\nfrom the need for a constant supply of water. Furthermore, seeds remain in a state of dormancy\u2014induced by desiccation and\nthe hormone abscisic acid\u2014until conditions for growth become favorable. Whether blown by the wind, floating on water, or\ncarried away by animals, seeds are scattered in an expanding geographic range, thus avoiding competition with the parent\nplant.\nPollen grains (Figure 26.5) are male gametophytes containing just a few cells and are distributed by wind, water, or an animal\npollinator. The whole structure is protected from desiccation and can reach the female organs without depending on water.\nAfter reaching a female gametophyte, the pollen grain grows a tube that will deliver a male nucleus to the egg cell. The sperm of\nmodern gymnosperms and all angiosperms lack flagella, but in cycads, Ginkgo, and other primitive gymnosperms, the sperm\nare still motile, and use flagella to swim to the female gamete; however, they are delivered to the female gametophyte enclosed in\na pollen grain. The pollen grows or is taken into a fertilization chamber, where the motile sperm are released and swim a short\ndistance to an egg.\n672\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 26.5 Pollen fossils.

Baker, USGS; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nEvolution of Angiosperms\nThe roughly 200 million years between the appearance of the gymnosperms and the flowering plants gives us some appreciation\nfor the evolutionary experimentation that ultimately produced flowers and fruit. Angiosperms (\u201cseed in a vessel\u201d) produce a\nflower containing male and/or female reproductive structures. Fossil evidence (Figure 26.6) indicates that flowering plants first\nappeared about 125 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous (late in the Mesozoic era), and were rapidly diversifying by about\n100 million years ago in the Middle Cretaceous. Earlier traces of angiosperms are scarce. Fossilized pollen recovered from\nJurassic geological material has been attributed to angiosperms. A few early Cretaceous rocks show clear imprints of leaves\nresembling angiosperm leaves. By the mid-Cretaceous, a staggering number of diverse flowering plants crowd the fossil record.\nThe same geological period is also marked by the appearance of many modern groups of insects, suggesting that pollinating\ninsects played a key role in the evolution of flowering plants.\nNew data in comparative genomics and paleobotany (the study of ancient plants) have shed some light on the evolution of\nangiosperms. Although the angiosperms appeared after the gymnosperms, they are probably not derived from gymnosperm\nancestors. Instead, the angiosperms form a sister clade (a species and its descendents) that developed in parallel with the\ngymnosperms. The two innovative structures of flowers and fruit represent an improved reproductive strategy that served to\nprotect the embryo, while increasing genetic variability and range. There is no current consensus on the origin of the\nangiosperms. Paleobotanists debate whether angiosperms evolved from small woody bushes, or were related to the ancestors of\ntropical grasses. Both views draw support from cladistics, and the so-called woody magnoliid hypothesis\u2014which proposes that\nthe early ancestors of angiosperms were shrubs like modern magnolia\u2014also offers molecular biological evidence.\nThe most primitive living angiosperm is considered to be Amborella trichopoda, a small plant native to the rainforest of New\nCaledonia, an island in the South Pacific. Analysis of the genome of A. trichopoda has shown that it is related to all existing\nflowering plants and belongs to the oldest confirmed branch of the angiosperm family tree. The nuclear genome shows evidence\nof an ancient whole-genome duplication. The mitochondrial genome is large and multichromosomal, containing elements from\nthe mitochondrial genomes of several other species, including algae and a moss. A few other angiosperm groups, called basal\nangiosperms, are viewed as having ancestral traits because they branched off early from the phylogenetic tree. Most modern\nangiosperms are classified as either monocots or eudicots, based on the structure of their leaves and embryos. Basal\n26.1 \u2022 Evolution of Seed Plants\n673\nangiosperms, such as water lilies, are considered more ancestral in nature because they share morphological traits with both\nmonocots and eudicots.\nFigure 26.6 Ficus imprint. This leaf imprint shows a Ficus speciosissima, an angiosperm that flourished during the Cretaceous period.\n(credit: W. T. Lee, USGS)\nFlowers and Fruits as an Evolutionary Adaptation\nAngiosperms produce their gametes in separate organs, which are usually housed in a flower. Both fertilization and embryo\ndevelopment take place inside an anatomical structure that provides a stable system of sexual reproduction largely sheltered\nfrom environmental fluctuations. With about 300,000 species, flowering plants are the most diverse phylum on Earth after\ninsects, which number about 1,200,000 species. Flowers come in a bewildering array of sizes, shapes, colors, smells, and\narrangements. Most flowers have a mutualistic pollinator, with the distinctive features of flowers reflecting the nature of the\npollination agent. The relationship between pollinator and flower characteristics is one of the great examples of coevolution.\nFollowing fertilization of the egg, the ovule grows into a seed. The surrounding tissues of the ovary thicken, developing into a\nfruit that will protect the seed and often ensure its dispersal over a wide geographic range. Not all fruits develop completely\nfrom an ovary; such \u201cfalse fruits\" or pseudocarps, develop from tissues adjacent to the ovary. Like flowers, fruit can vary\ntremendously in appearance, size, smell, and taste. Tomatoes, green peppers, corn, and avocados are all examples of fruits.\nAlong with pollen and seeds, fruits also act as agents of dispersal. Some may be carried away by the wind. Many attract animals\nthat will eat the fruit and pass the seeds through their digestive systems, then deposit the seeds in another location. Cockleburs\nare covered with stiff, hooked spines that can hook into fur (or clothing) and hitch a ride on an animal for long distances. The\ncockleburs that clung to the velvet trousers of an enterprising Swiss hiker, George de Mestral, inspired his invention of the loop\nand hook fastener he named Velcro.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nBuilding Phylogenetic Trees with Analysis of DNA Sequence Alignments\nAll living organisms display patterns of relationships derived from their evolutionary history. Phylogeny is the science that\ndescribes the relative connections between organisms, in terms of ancestral and descendant species. Phylogenetic trees, such as\nthe plant evolutionary history shown in Figure 26.7, are tree-like branching diagrams that depict these relationships. Species\nare found at the tips of the branches. Each branching point, called a node, is the point at which a single taxonomic group\n(taxon), such as a species, separates into two or more species.\n674\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 26.7 Plant phylogeny. This phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationships of plants.\nPhylogenetic trees have been built to describe the relationships between species since the first sketch of a tree that appeared in\nDarwin's Origin of Species. Traditional methods involve comparison of homologous anatomical structures and embryonic\ndevelopment, assuming that closely related organisms share anatomical features that emerge during embryo development.\nSome traits that disappear in the adult are present in the embryo; for example, an early human embryo has a postanal tail, as do\nall members of the Phylum Chordata. The study of fossil records shows the intermediate stages that link an ancestral form to its\ndescendants. However, many of the approaches to classification based on the fossil record alone are imprecise and lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. As the tools of molecular biology and computational analysis have been developed and\nperfected in recent years, a new generation of tree-building methods has taken shape. The key assumption is that genes for\nessential proteins or RNA structures, such as the ribosomal RNAs, are inherently conserved because mutations (changes in the\nDNA sequence) could possibly compromise the survival of the organism. DNA from minute samples of living organisms or\nfossils can be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced, targeting the regions of the genome that are most\nlikely to be conserved between species. The genes encoding the 18S ribosomal RNA from the small subunit and plastid genes are\nfrequently chosen for DNA alignment analysis.\nOnce the sequences of interest are obtained, they are compared with existing sequences in databases such as GenBank, which is\nmaintained by The National Center for Biotechnology Information. A number of computational tools are available to align and\nanalyze sequences. Sophisticated computer analysis programs determine the percentage of sequence identity or homology.\nSequence homology can be used to estimate the evolutionary distance between two DNA sequences and reflect the time elapsed\nsince the genes separated from a common ancestor. Molecular analysis has revolutionized phylogenetic trees. In some cases,\nprior results from morphological studies have been confirmed: for example, confirming Amborella trichopoda as the most\nprimitive angiosperm known. However, some groups and relationships have been rearranged as a result of DNA analysis.\n26.1 \u2022 Evolution of Seed Plants\n675\n26.2 Gymnosperms\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the type of seeds produced by gymnosperms, as well as other characteristics of gymnosperms\n\u2022\nIdentify the geological era dominated by the gymnosperms and describe the conditions to which they were\nadapted\n\u2022\nList the four groups of modern-day gymnosperms and provide examples of each\n\u2022\nDescribe the life cycle of a typical gymnosperm\nGymnosperms, meaning \u201cnaked seeds,\u201d are a diverse group of seed plants. According to the \"anthophyte\" hypothesis, the\nangiosperms are a sister group of one group of gymnosperms (the Gnetales), which makes the gymnosperms a paraphyletic\ngroup. Paraphyletic groups are those in which not all descendants of a single common ancestor are included in the group.\nHowever , the \"netifer\" hypothesis suggests that the gnetophytes are sister to the conifers, making the gymnosperms\nmonophyletic and sister to the angiosperms. Further molecular and anatomical studies may clarify these relationships.\nCharacteristics of the gymnosperms include naked seeds, separate female and male gamtophytes, pollen cones and ovulate\ncones, pollination by wind and insects, and tracheids (which transport water and solutes in the vascular system).\nGymnosperm seeds are not enclosed in an ovary; rather, they are only partially sheltered by modified leaves called sporophylls.\nYou may recall the term strobilus (plural = strobili) describes a tight arrangement of sporophylls around a central stalk, as seen\nin pine cones. Some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation. The layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds\nthe megasporangium, and later, the embryo, is called the integument.\nGymnosperms were the dominant phylum in the Mesozoic era. They are adapted to live where fresh water is scarce during part\nof the year, or in the nitrogen-poor soil of a bog. Therefore, they are still the prominent phylum in the coniferous biome or taiga,\nwhere the evergreen conifers have a selective advantage in cold and dry weather. Evergreen conifers continue low levels of\nphotosynthesis during the cold months, and are ready to take advantage of the first sunny days of spring. One disadvantage is\nthat conifers are more susceptible than deciduous trees to leaf infestations because most conifers do not lose their leaves all at\nonce. They cannot, therefore, shed parasites and restart with a fresh supply of leaves in spring.\nThe life cycle of a gymnosperm involves alternation of generations, with a dominant sporophyte in which reduced male and\nfemale gametophytes reside. All gymnosperms are heterosporous. The male and female reproductive organs can form in cones\nor strobili. Male and female sporangia are produced either on the same plant, described as monoecious (\u201cone home\u201d or\nbisexual), or on separate plants, referred to as dioecious (\u201ctwo homes\u201d or unisexual) plants. The life cycle of a conifer will serve as\nour example of reproduction in gymnosperms.\nLife Cycle of a Conifer\nPine trees are conifers (coniferous = cone bearing) and carry both male and female sporophylls on the same mature sporophyte.\nTherefore, they are monoecious plants. Like all gymnosperms, pines are heterosporous and generate two different types of\nspores (male microspores and female megaspores). Male and female spores develop in different strobili, with small male cones\nand larger female cones. In the male cones, or staminate cones, the microsporocytes undergo meiosis and the resultant haploid\nmicrospores give rise to male gametophytes or \u201cpollen grains\u201d by mitosis. Each pollen grain consists of just a few haploid cells\nenclosed in a tough wall reinforced with sporopollenin. In the spring, large amounts of yellow pollen are released and carried by\nthe wind. Some gametophytes will land on a female cone. Pollination is defined as the initiation of pollen tube growth. The\npollen tube develops slowly, and the generative cell in the pollen grain produces two haploid sperm or generative nuclei by\nmitosis. At fertilization, one of the haploid sperm nuclei will unite with the haploid nucleus of an egg cell.\nFemale cones, or ovulate cones, contain two ovules per scale. Each ovule has a narrow passage that opens near the base of the\nsporophyll. This passage is the micropyle, through which a pollen tube will later grow. One megaspore mother cell, or\nmegasporocyte, undergoes meiosis in each ovule. Three of the four cells break down; only a single surviving cell will develop into\na female multicellular gametophyte, which encloses archegonia (an archegonium is a reproductive organ that contains a single\nlarge egg). As the female gametophyte begins to develop, a sticky pollination drop traps windblown pollen grains near the\nopening of the micropyle. A pollen tube is formed and grows toward the developing gametophyte. One of the generative or\nsperm nuclei from the pollen tube will enter the egg and fuse with the egg nucleus as the egg matures. Upon fertilization, the\ndiploid egg will give rise to the embryo, which is enclosed in a seed coat of tissue from the parent plant. Although several eggs\nmay be formed and even fertilized, there is usually a single surviving embryo in each ovule. Fertilization and seed development\nis a long process in pine trees: it may take up to two years after pollination. The seed that is formed contains three generations of\n676\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ntissues: the seed coat that originates from the sporophyte tissue, the gametophyte tissue that will provide nutrients, and the\nembryo itself.\nFigure 26.8 illustrates the life cycle of a conifer. The sporophyte (2n) phase is the longest phase in the life of a gymnosperm. The\ngametophytes (1n)\u2014produced by microspores and megaspores\u2014are reduced in size. It may take more than a year between\npollination and fertilization while the pollen tube grows towards the growing female gametophyte (1n), which develops from a\nsingle megaspore. The slow growth of the pollen tube allows the female gametophyte time to produce eggs (1n).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 26.8 Conifer life cycle. This image shows the life cycle of a conifer.

Coniferophyta, Cycadophyta, and Ginkgophyta are similar in their pattern\nof seed development and also in their production of secondary cambium (cells that generate the vascular system of the trunk or\nstem and are partially specialized for water transportation). However, the three phyla are not closely related phylogenetically to\n26.2 \u2022 Gymnosperms\n677\neach other. Gnetophyta are considered the closest group to angiosperms because they produce true xylem tissue, with vessels as\nwell as the tracheids found in the rest of the gymnosperms. It is possible that vessel elements arose independently in the two\ngroups\nConifers (Coniferophyta)\nConifers are the dominant phylum of gymnosperms, with the greatest variety of species (Figure 26.9). Typical conifers are tall\ntrees that bear scale-like or needle-like leaves. Water evaporation from leaves is reduced by their narrow shape and a thick\ncuticle. Snow easily slides off needle-shaped leaves, keeping the snow load light, thus reducing broken branches. Such\nadaptations to cold and dry weather explain the predominance of conifers at high altitudes and in cold climates. Conifers\ninclude familiar evergreen trees such as pines, spruces, firs, cedars, sequoias, and yews. A few species are deciduous and lose\ntheir leaves in fall. The bald cypress, dawn redwood, European larch and the tamarack (Figure 26.9c) are examples of deciduous\nconifers. Many coniferous trees are harvested for paper pulp and timber. The wood of conifers is more primitive than the wood\nof angiosperms; it contains tracheids, but no vessel elements, and is therefore referred to as \u201csoft wood.\u201d\nFigure 26.9 Conifers. Conifers are the dominant form of vegetation in cold or arid environments and at high altitudes. Shown here are the\n(a) evergreen spruce Picea sp., (b) juniper Juniperus sp., (c) coastal redwood or sequoia Sequoia sempervirens, and (d) the tamarack Larix\nlarcinia. Notice the deciduous yellow leaves of the tamarack.

Cycads\nbear large strobili or cones (Figure 26.10), and may be pollinated by beetles rather than wind, which is unusual for a\ngymnosperm. Large cycads dominated the landscape during the age of dinosaurs in the Mesozoic, but only a hundred or so\nsmaller species persisted to modern times. They face possible extinction, and several species are protected through international\nconventions. Because of their attractive shape, they are often used as ornamental plants in gardens in the tropics and\nsubtropics.\n678\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 26.10 Cycad. This cycad, Encephalartos ferox, has large cones and broad, fern-like leaves. (credit: Wendy Cutler)\nGinkgophytes\nThe single surviving species of the ginkgophytes group is Ginkgo biloba (Figure 26.11). Its fan-shaped leaves\u2014unique among\nseed plants because they feature a dichotomous venation pattern\u2014turn yellow in autumn and fall from the tree. For centuries,\nG. biloba was cultivated by Chinese Buddhist monks in monasteries, which ensured its preservation. It is planted in public\nspaces because it is unusually resistant to pollution. Male and female organs are produced on separate plants. Typically,\ngardeners plant only male trees because the seeds produced by the female plant have an off-putting smell of rancid butter.\nFigure 26.11 Ginkgo. This plate from the 1870 book Flora Japonica, Sectio Prima (Tafelband) depicts the leaves and fruit of Ginkgo biloba,\nas drawn by Philipp Franz von Siebold and Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini.\nGnetophytes\nThe phylogenetic position of the gnetophytes is not currently resolved. Their possession of vessel elements suggests they are the\nclosest relative to modern angiosperms. However, molecular analysis places them closer to the conifers. The three living genera\nare quite dissimilar: Ephedra, Gnetum, and Welwitschia (Figure 26.12), which may indicate that the group is not monophyletic.\nLike angiosperms, they have broad leaves. Ephedra (Figure 26.12a) occurs in dry areas of the West Coast of the United States and\n26.2 \u2022 Gymnosperms\n679\nMexico. Ephedra\u2019s small, scale-like leaves are the source of the compound ephedrine, which is used in medicine as a potent\ndecongestant. Because ephedrine is similar to amphetamines, both in chemical structure and neurological effects, its use is\nrestricted to prescription drugs. Gnetum species (Figure 26.12b) are found in some parts of Africa, South America, and\nSoutheast Asia, and include trees, shrubs and vines. Welwitschia (Figure 26.12c) is found in the Namib desert, and is possibly\nthe oddest member of the group. It produces only two leaves, which grow continuously throughout the life of the plant (some\nplants are hundreds of years old). Like the ginkgos, Welwitschia produces male and female gametes on separate plants.\nFigure 26.12 (a) Ephedra viridis, known by the common name Mormon tea, grows on the West Coast of the United States and Mexico.

With more than 300,000 species, the angiosperm phylum\n(Anthophyta) is second only to insects in terms of diversification.\nFigure 26.13 Flowers. These flowers grow in a botanical garden border in Bellevue, WA. Flowering plants dominate terrestrial landscapes.\nThe vivid colors of flowers and enticing fragrance of flowers are adaptations to pollination by animals like insects, birds, and bats. (credit:\n680\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nMyriam Feldman)\nThe success of angiosperms is due to two novel reproductive structures: flowers and fruits. The function of the flower is to\nensure pollination, often by arthropods, as well as to protect a developing embryo. The colors and patterns on flowers offer\nspecific signals to many pollinating insects or birds and bats that have coevolved with them. For example, some patterns are\nvisible only in the ultraviolet range of light, which can be seen by arthropod pollinators. For some pollinators, flowers advertise\nthemselves as a reliable source of nectar. Flower scent also helps to select its pollinators. Sweet scents tend to attract bees and\nbutterflies and moths, but some flies and beetles might prefer scents that signal fermentation or putrefaction. Flowers also\nprovide protection for the ovule and developing embryo inside a receptacle. The function of the fruit is seed protection and\ndispersal. Different fruit structures or tissues on fruit\u2014such as sweet flesh, wings, parachutes, or spines that grab\u2014reflect the\ndispersal strategies that help spread seeds.\nFlowers\nFlowers are modified leaves, or sporophylls, organized around a central receptacle. Although they vary greatly in appearance,\nvirtually all flowers contain the same structures: sepals, petals, carpels, and stamens. The peduncle typically attaches the flower\nto the plant proper. A whorl of sepals (collectively called the calyx) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the\nunopened floral bud. Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions. For example, the corolla in\nlilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical. Petals, collectively the corolla, are located\ninside the whorl of sepals and may display vivid colors to attract pollinators. Sepals and petals together form the perianth. The\nsexual organs, the female gynoecium and male androecium are located at the center of the flower. Typically, the sepals, petals,\nand stamens are attached to the receptacle at the base of the gynoecium, but the gynoecium may also be located deeper in the\nreceptacle, with the other floral structures attached above it.\nAs illustrated in Figure 26.14, the innermost part of a perfect flower is the gynoecium, the location in the flower where the eggs\nwill form. The female reproductive unit consists of one or more carpels, each of which has a stigma, style, and ovary. The stigma\nis the location where the pollen is deposited either by wind or a pollinating arthropod. The sticky surface of the stigma traps\npollen grains, and the style is a connecting structure through which the pollen tube will grow to reach the ovary. The ovary\nhouses one or more ovules, each of which will ultimately develop into a seed. Flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may\nbe singular, multiple, or fused. (Multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil.) The androecium, or male reproductive region is\ncomposed of multiple stamens surrounding the central carpel. Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac-\nlike structure called the anther. The filament supports the anther, where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop\ninto haploid pollen grains, or male gametophytes.\n26.3 \u2022 Angiosperms\n681\nFigure 26.14 Flower structure. This image depicts the structure of a perfect flower. Perfect flowers produce both male and female floral\norgans. The flower shown has only one carpel, but some flowers have a cluster of carpels. Together, all the carpels make up the gynoecium.\n(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe Life Cycle of an Angiosperm\nThe adult or sporophyte phase is the main phase of an angiosperm\u2019s life cycle (Figure 26.15). Like gymnosperms, angiosperms\nare heterosporous. Therefore, they produce microspores, which will generate pollen grains as the male gametophytes, and\nmegaspores, which will form an ovule that contains female gametophytes. Inside the anther\u2019s microsporangia, male sporocytes\ndivide by meiosis to generate haploid microspores, which, in turn, undergo mitosis and give rise to pollen grains. Each pollen\ngrain contains two cells: one generative cell that will divide into two sperm and a second cell that will become the pollen tube\ncell.\n682\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 26.15 Angiosperm life cycle. The life cycle of an angiosperm is shown. Anthers and carpels are structures that shelter the actual\ngametophytes: the pollen grain and embryo sac. Double fertilization is a process unique to angiosperms. (credit: modification of work by\nMariana Ruiz Villareal)\nQuestion: If a flower lacked a megasporangium, what type of gamete would not form? If the flower lacked a microsporangium,\nwhat type of gamete would not form?\nThe ovule, sheltered within the ovary of the carpel, contains the megasporangium protected by two layers of integuments and\nthe ovary wall. Within each megasporangium, a diploid megasporocyte undergoes meiosis, generating four haploid\nmegaspores\u2014three small and one large. Only the large megaspore survives; it divides mitotically three times to produce eight\nnuclei distributed among the seven cells of the female gametophyte or embryo sac. Three of these cells are located at each pole of\nthe embryo sac. The three cells at one pole become the egg and two synergids. The three cells at the opposite pole become\nantipodal cells. The center cell contains the remaining two nuclei (polar nuclei). This cell will eventually produce the endosperm\nof the seed. The mature embryo sac then contains one egg cell, two synergids or \u201chelper\u201d cells, three antipodal cells (which\neventually degenerate), and a central cell with two polar nuclei. When a pollen grain reaches the stigma, a pollen tube extends\nfrom the grain, grows down the style, and enters through the micropyle: an opening in the integuments of the ovule. The two\nsperm are deposited in the embryo sac.\nA double fertilization event then occurs. One sperm and the egg combine, forming a diploid zygote\u2014the future embryo. The\nother sperm fuses with the polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that will develop into the endosperm\u2014the tissue that serves as a\nfood reserve for the developing embryo. The zygote develops into an embryo with a radicle, or small root, and one (monocot) or\n26.3 \u2022 Angiosperms\n683\ntwo (dicot) leaf-like organs called cotyledons. This difference in the number of embryonic leaves is the basis for the two major\ngroups of angiosperms: the monocots and the eudicots. Seed food reserves are stored outside the embryo, in the form of\ncomplex carbohydrates, lipids, or proteins. The cotyledons serve as conduits to transmit the broken-down food reserves from\ntheir storage site inside the seed to the developing embryo. The seed consists of a toughened layer of integuments forming the\ncoat, the endosperm with food reserves, and at the center, the well-protected embryo.\nMost angiosperms have perfect flowers, which means that each flower carries both stamens and carpels (Figure 26.15). In\nmonoecious plants, male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers are separate, but carried on the same plant. Sweetgums\n(Liquidambar spp.) and beeches (Betula spp. are monoecious (Figure 26.16). In dioecious plants, male and female flowers are\nfound on separate plants. Willows (Salix spp.) and poplars (Populus spp.) are dioecious. In spite of the predominance of perfect\nflowers, only a few species of angiosperms self-pollinate. Both anatomical and environmental barriers promote cross-\npollination mediated by a physical agent (wind or water), or an animal, such as an insect or bird. Cross-pollination increases\ngenetic diversity in a species.\nFigure 26.16 Beech inflorescences. The female inflorescence is at the upper left. The male inflorescence is at the lower right.

The seed forms in an ovary, which also enlarges as the\nseeds grow. Many foods commonly called vegetables are actually fruits. Eggplants, zucchini, string beans, tomatoes, and bell\npeppers are all technically fruits because they contain seeds and are derived from the thick ovary tissue. Acorns are true nuts,\nand winged maple \u201chelicopter seeds\u201d or whirligigs (whose botanical name is samara) are also fruits. Botanists classify fruit into\nmore than two dozen different categories, only a few of which are actually fleshy and sweet.\nMature fruit can be fleshy or dry. Fleshy fruit include the familiar berries, peaches, apples, grapes, and tomatoes. Rice, wheat,\nand nuts are examples of dry fruit. Another subtle distinction is that not all fruits are derived from just the ovary. For instance,\nstrawberries are derived from the ovary as well as the receptacle, and apples are formed from the ovary and the pericarp, or\n684\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nhypanthium. Some fruits are derived from separate ovaries in a single flower, such as the raspberry. Other fruits, such as the\npineapple, form from clusters of flowers. Additionally, some fruits, like watermelon and orange, have rinds. Regardless of how\nthey are formed, fruits are an agent of seed dispersal. The variety of shapes and characteristics reflect the mode of dispersal.\nWind carries the light dry fruits of trees and dandelions. Water transports floating coconuts. Some fruits attract herbivores with\ntheir color or scent, or as food. Once eaten, tough, undigested seeds are dispersed through the herbivore\u2019s feces (endozoochory).\nOther fruits have burrs and hooks to cling to fur and hitch rides on animals (epizoochory).\nDiversity of Angiosperms\nAngiosperms are classified in a single phylum: the Anthophyta. Modern angiosperms appear to be a monophyletic group, which\nas you may recall means that they originated from a single ancestor. Within the angiosperms are three major groups: basal\nangiosperms, monocots, and dicots. Basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the\nseparation of the monocots and eudicots, because they exhibit traits from both groups. They are categorized separately in most\nclassification schemes. The basal angiosperms include Amborella, water lilies, the Magnoliids (magnolia trees, laurels, and spice\npeppers), and a group called the Austrobaileyales, which includes the star anise. The monocots and dicots are differentiated on\nthe basis of the structure of the cotyledons, pollen grains, and other structures. Monocots include grasses and lilies, and the\ndicots form a multi-branched group that includes (among many others) roses, cabbages, sunflowers, and mints.\nBasal Angiosperms\nThe Magnoliidae are represented by the magnolias, laurels, and peppers. Magnolias are tall trees bearing dark, shiny leaves, and\nlarge, fragrant flowers with many parts, and are considered archaic (Figure 26.17). In the outer whorl of the magnolia flower the\nsepals and petals are undifferentiated and are collectively called tepals. The reproductive parts are arranged in a spiral around a\ncone-shaped receptacle, with the carpels located above the stamens (Figure 26.17). The aggregate fruit, with one seed formed\nfrom each carpel, is seen in Figure 26.18d. Laurel trees produce fragrant leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The Laurales\ngrow mostly in warmer climates and are small trees and shrubs. Familiar plants in this group include the bay laurel, cinnamon,\nspice bush (Figure 26.18a), and avocado tree.\nFigure 26.17 Magnolia grandiflora. A cluster of carpels can be seen above the stamens, which have shed their pollen and begun to drop\nfrom the inflorescence. In the flower, the sepals and petals are undifferentiated and are collectively called tepals.

Other anatomical\nfeatures shared by monocots include veins that run parallel to and along the length of the leaves, and flower parts that are\narranged in a three- or six-fold symmetry. True woody tissue is rarely found in monocots. In palm trees, vascular and\nparenchyma tissues produced by the primary and secondary thickening meristems form the trunk. The pollen from the first\nangiosperms was likely monosulcate, containing a single furrow or pore through the outer layer. This feature is still seen in the\nmodern monocots. Vascular tissue of the stem is scattered, not arranged in any particular pattern, but is organized in a ring in\nthe roots. The root system consists of multiple fibrous roots, with no major tap root. Adventitious roots often emerge from the\nstem or leaves. The monocots include familiar plants such as the true lilies (Liliopsida), orchids, yucca, asparagus, grasses, and\npalms. Many important crops are monocots, such as rice and other cereals, corn, sugar cane, and tropical fruits like bananas\nand pineapples (Figure 26.19a,b,c).\n686\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 26.19 Monocot and dicot crop plants.

Veins form a network in\nleaves, and flower parts come in four, five, or many whorls. Vascular tissue forms a ring in the stem; in monocots, vascular tissue\nis scattered in the stem. Eudicots can be herbaceous (not woody), or produce woody tissues. Most eudicots produce pollen that\nis trisulcate or triporate, with three furrows or pores. The root system is usually anchored by one main root developed from the\nembryonic radicle. Eudicots comprise two-thirds of all flowering plants. The major differences between monocots and eudicots\nare summarized in Table 26.1. However, some species may exhibit characteristics usually associated with the other group, so\nidentification of a plant as a monocot or a eudicot is not always straightforward.\nComparison of Structural Characteristics of Monocots and Eudicots\nCharacteristic\nMonocot\nEudicot\nCotyledon\nOne\nTwo\nVeins in Leaves\nParallel\nNetwork (branched)\nStem Vascular Tissue\nScattered\nArranged in ring pattern\nRoots\nNetwork of fibrous roots\nTap root with many lateral roots\nPollen\nMonosulcate\nTrisulcate\nFlower Parts\nThree or multiple of three\nFour, five, multiple of four or five and whorls\nTable 26.1\n26.3 \u2022 Angiosperms\n687\n26.4 The Role of Seed Plants\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how angiosperm diversity is due, in part, to multiple complex interactions with animals\n\u2022\nDescribe ways in which pollination occurs\n\u2022\nDiscuss the roles that plants play in ecosystems and how deforestation threatens plant biodiversity\nWithout seed plants, life as we know it would not be possible. Plants play a key role in the maintenance of terrestrial ecosystems\nthrough the stabilization of soils, cycling of carbon, and climate moderation. Large tropical forests release oxygen and act as\ncarbon dioxide \u201csinks.\u201d Seed plants provide shelter to many life forms, as well as food for herbivores, thereby indirectly feeding\ncarnivores. Plant secondary metabolites are used for medicinal purposes and industrial production. Virtually all animal life is\ndependent on plants for survival.\nAnimals and Plants: Herbivory\nCoevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support, especially because\nboth angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle Mesozoic. Many authors have attributed the\ndiversity of plants and insects to both pollination and herbivory, or the consumption of plants by insects and other animals.\nHerbivory is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination. Coevolution of herbivores and plant defenses is easily\nand commonly observed in nature. Unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry\nanimals (although mimicry has been used to entice pollinators). A sort of arms race exists between plants and herbivores. To\n\u201ccombat\u201d herbivores, some plant seeds\u2014such as acorn and unripened persimmon\u2014are high in alkaloids and therefore unsavory\nto some animals. Other plants are protected by bark, although some animals developed specialized mouth pieces to tear and\nchew vegetal material. Spines and thorns (Figure 26.20) deter most animals, except for mammals with thick fur, and some birds\nhave specialized beaks to get past such defenses.\nFigure 26.20 Plant defenses. (a) Spines and (b) thorns are examples of plant defenses. (credit a: modification of work by Jon Sullivan;\ncredit b: modification of work by I. S\u00e1\u010dek, Sr.)\nHerbivory has been exploited by seed plants for their own benefit. The dispersal of fruits by herbivorous animals is a striking\nexample of mutualistic relationships. The plant offers to the herbivore a nutritious source of food in return for spreading the\nplant\u2019s genetic material to a wider area.\nAn extreme example of coevolution (discovered by Daniel Janzen) between an animal and a plant is exemplified by Mexican\nacacia trees and their attendant acacia ants Pseudomyrmex spp. (this is termed myrmecophytism). The trees support the ants\nwith shelter and food: The ants nest in the hollows of large thorns produced by the tree and feed on sugary secretions produced\nat the ends of the leaves. The sugar pellets also help to keep the ants from interfering with insect pollinators. In return, ants\ndiscourage herbivores, both invertebrates and vertebrates, by stinging and attacking leaf-eaters and insects ovipositing on the\nplants. The ants also help to remove potential plant pathogens, such as fungal growths. Another case of insect-plant coevolution\nis found in bracken fern (Pteridium aquinilum), whose subspecies are found throughout the world. Bracken ferns produce a\nnumber of \u201csecondary plant compounds\u201d in their adult fronds that serve as defensive compounds against nonadapted insect\nattack (these compounds include cyanogenic glucosides, tannins, and phenolics). However, during the \u201cfiddlehead\u201d or crozier\nstage, bracken secretes nutritious sugary and proteinaceous compounds from special \u201cnectaries\u201d that attract ants and even\nspecies of jumping spiders, all of which defend the plant\u2019s croziers until they are fully unfolded. These opportunistic groups of\nprotective arthropods greatly reduce the damage that otherwise would occur during the early stages of growth.\n688\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nAnimals and Plants: Pollination\nFlowers pollinated by wind are usually small, feathery, and visually inconspicuous. Grasses are a successful group of flowering\nplants that are wind pollinated. They produce large amounts of powdery pollen carried over large distances by the wind. Some\nlarge trees such as oaks, maples, and birches are also wind pollinated.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nExplore this website (http://openstax.org/l/pollinators2) for additional information on pollinators.\nMore than 80 percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination (technically the transfer of pollen from the anther to\nthe stigma). Consequently, plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators. With over 200,000 different plants\ndependent on animal pollination, the plant needs to advertise to its pollinators with some specificity. The specificity of\nspecialized plant structures that target animals can be very surprising. It is possible, for example, to determine the general type\nof pollinators favored by a plant by observing the flower\u2019s physical characteristics. Many bird or insect-pollinated flowers secrete\nnectar, which is a sugary liquid. They also produce both fertile pollen, for reproduction, and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for\nbirds and insects. Many butterflies and bees can detect ultraviolet light, and flowers that attract these pollinators usually display\na pattern of ultraviolet reflectance that helps them quickly locate the flower's center. In this manner, pollinating insects collect\nnectar while at the same time are dusted with pollen (Figure 26.21). Large, red flowers with little smell and a long funnel shape\nare preferred by hummingbirds, who have good color perception, a poor sense of smell, and need a strong perch. White flowers\nthat open at night attract moths. Other animals\u2014such as bats, lemurs, and lizards\u2014can also act as pollinating agents. Any\ndisruption to these interactions, such as the disappearance of bees, for example as a consequence of colony collapse disorders,\ncan lead to disaster for agricultural industries that depend heavily on pollinated crops.\nFigure 26.21 Pollination. As a bee collects nectar from a flower, it is dusted by pollen, which it then disperses to other flowers. (credit: John\nSeverns)\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION\nTesting Attraction of Flies by Rotting Flesh Smell\nQuestion: Will flowers that offer cues to bees attract carrion flies if sprayed with compounds that smell like rotten flesh?\nBackground: Visitation of flowers by pollinating flies is a function mostly of smell. Flies are attracted by rotting flesh and\ncarrions. The putrid odor seems to be the major attractant. The polyamines putrescine and cadaverine, which are the products of\nprotein breakdown after animal death, are the source of the pungent smell of decaying meat. Some plants strategically attract\nflies by synthesizing polyamines similar to those generated by decaying flesh and thereby attract carrion flies.\nFlies seek out dead animals because they normally lay their eggs on them and their maggots feed on the decaying flesh.\nInterestingly, time of death can be determined by a forensic entomologist based on the stages and type of maggots recovered\nfrom cadavers.\n26.4 \u2022 The Role of Seed Plants\n689\nHypothesis: Because flies are drawn to other organisms based on smell and not sight, a flower that is normally attractive to bees\nbecause of its colors will attract flies if it is sprayed with polyamines similar to those generated by decaying flesh.\nTest the hypothesis:\n1.\nSelect flowers usually pollinated by bees. White petunia may be a good choice.\n2.\nDivide the flowers into two groups, and while wearing eye protection and gloves, spray one group with a solution of either\nputrescine or cadaverine. (Putrescine dihydrochloride is typically available in 98 percent concentration; this can be diluted\nto approximately 50 percent for this experiment.)\n3.\nPlace the flowers in a location where flies are present, keeping the sprayed and unsprayed flowers separated.\n4.\nObserve the movement of the flies for one hour. Record the number of visits to the flowers using a table similar to Table\n26.2. Given the rapid movement of flies, it may be beneficial to use a video camera to record the fly\u2013flower interaction.\nReplay the video in slow motion to obtain an accurate record of the number of fly visits to the flowers.\n5.\nRepeat the experiment four more times with the same species of flower, but using different specimens.\n6.\nRepeat the entire experiment with a different type of flower that is normally pollinated by bees.\nResults of Number of Visits by Flies to Sprayed and Control/Unsprayed Flowers\nTrial #\nSprayed Flowers\nUnsprayed Flowers\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nTable 26.2\nAnalyze your data: Review the data you have recorded. Average the number of visits that flies made to sprayed flowers over the\ncourse of the five trials (on the first flower type) and compare and contrast them to the average number of visits that flies made\nto the unsprayed/control flowers. Can you draw any conclusions regarding the attraction of the flies to the sprayed flowers?\nFor the second flower type used, average the number of visits that flies made to sprayed flowers over the course of the five trials\nand compare and contrast them to the average number of visits that flies made to the unsprayed/control flowers. Can you draw\nany conclusions regarding the attraction of the flies to the sprayed flowers?\nCompare and contrast the average number of visits that flies made to the two flower types. Can you draw any conclusions about\nwhether the appearance of the flower had any impact on the attraction of flies? Did smell override any appearance differences,\nor were the flies attracted to one flower type more than another?\nForm a conclusion: Do the results support the hypothesis? If not, how can your observations be explained?\nThe Importance of Seed Plants in Human Life\nSeed plants are the foundation of human diets across the world (Figure 26.22). Many societies eat almost exclusively vegetarian\nfare and depend solely on seed plants for their nutritional needs. A few crops (rice, wheat, and potatoes) dominate the\nagricultural landscape. Many crops were developed during the agricultural revolution, when human societies made the\ntransition from nomadic hunter\u2013gatherers to horticulture and agriculture. Cereals, rich in carbohydrates, provide the staple of\nmany human diets. Beans and nuts supply proteins. Fats are derived from crushed seeds, as is the case for peanut and rapeseed\n(canola) oils, or fruits such as olives. Animal husbandry also consumes large quantities of crop plants.\nStaple crops are not the only food derived from seed plants. Various fruits and vegetables provide nutrient macromolecules,\n690\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nvitamins, minerals, and fiber. Sugar, to sweeten dishes, is produced from the monocot sugarcane and the eudicot sugar beet.\nDrinks are made from infusions of tea leaves, chamomile flowers, crushed coffee beans, or powdered cocoa beans. Spices come\nfrom many different plant parts: saffron and cloves are stamens and buds, black pepper and vanilla are seeds, the bark of a bush\nin the Laurales family supplies cinnamon, and the herbs that flavor many dishes come from dried leaves and fruit, such as the\npungent red chili pepper. The volatile oils of a number of flowers and bark provide the scent of perfumes.\nAdditionally, no discussion of seed plant contribution to human diet would be complete without the mention of alcohol.\nFermentation of plant-derived sugars and starches is used to produce alcoholic beverages in all societies. In some cases, the\nbeverages are derived from the fermentation of sugars from fruit, as with wines and, in other cases, from the fermentation of\ncarbohydrates derived from seeds, as with beers. The sharing of foods and beverages also contributes to human social ritual.\nSeed plants have many other uses, including providing wood as a source of timber for construction, fuel, and material to build\nfurniture. Most paper is derived from the pulp of coniferous trees. Fibers of seed plants such as cotton, flax, and hemp are\nwoven into cloth. Textile dyes, such as indigo, were mostly of plant origin until the advent of synthetic chemical dyes.\nLastly, it is more difficult to quantify the benefits of ornamental seed plants. These grace private and public spaces, adding\nbeauty and serenity to human lives and inspiring painters and poets alike.\nFigure 26.22 Human uses of plants. Humans rely on plants for a variety of reasons. (a) Cacao beans were introduced to Europe from the\nNew World, where they were used by Mesoamerican civilizations. Combined with sugar, another plant product, chocolate is a popular food.\n(b) Flowers like the tulip are cultivated for their beauty. (c) Quinine, extracted from cinchona trees, is used to treat malaria, to reduce fever,\nand to alleviate pain. (d) This violin is made of wood.

There are references to the use of\nplants\u2019 curative properties in Egyptian, Babylonian, and Chinese writings from 5,000 years ago. Many modern synthetic\ntherapeutic drugs are derived or synthesized de novo from plant secondary metabolites. It is important to note that the same\nplant extract can be a therapeutic remedy at low concentrations, become an addictive drug at higher doses, and can potentially\nkill at high concentrations. Table 26.3 presents a few drugs, their plants of origin, and their medicinal applications.\nPlant Origin of Medicinal Compounds and Medical Applications\nPlant\nCompound\nApplication\nDeadly nightshade\n(Atropa belladonna )\nAtropine\nDilate eye pupils for eye exams\nFoxglove (Digitalis\npurpurea)\nDigitalis\nHeart disease, stimulates heart beat\nYam (Dioscorea spp.)\nSteroids\nSteroid hormones: contraceptive pill and cortisone\nEphedra (Ephedra\nspp.)\nEphedrine\nDecongestant and bronchiole dilator\nPacific yew (Taxus\nbrevifolia)\nTaxol\nCancer chemotherapy; inhibits mitosis\nOpium poppy\n(Papaver\nsomniferum)\nOpioids\nAnalgesic (reduces pain without loss of consciousness) and narcotic (reduces pain\nwith drowsiness and loss of consciousness) in higher doses\nQuinine tree\n(Cinchona spp.)\nQuinine\nAntipyretic (lowers body temperature) and antimalarial\nWillow (Salix spp.)\nSalicylic\nacid\n(aspirin)\nAnalgesic and antipyretic\nTable 26.3\nCAREER CONNECTION\nEthnobotanist\nThe relatively new field of ethnobotany studies the interaction between a particular culture and the plants native to the region.\nSeed plants have a large influence on day-to-day human life. Not only are plants the major source of food and medicine, they\nalso influence many other aspects of society, from clothing to industry. The medicinal properties of plants were recognized early\non in human cultures. From the mid-1900s, synthetic chemicals began to supplant plant-based remedies.\nPharmacognosy is the branch of pharmacology that focuses on medicines derived from natural sources. With massive\nglobalization and industrialization, it is possible that much human knowledge of plants and their medicinal purposes will\ndisappear with the cultures that fostered them. This is where ethnobotanists come in. To learn about and understand the use of\nplants in a particular culture, an ethnobotanist must bring in knowledge of plant life and an understanding and appreciation of\ndiverse cultures and traditions. The Amazon forest is home to an incredible diversity of vegetation and is considered an\nuntapped resource of medicinal plants; yet, both the ecosystem and its indigenous cultures are threatened with extinction.\nTo become an ethnobotanist, a person must acquire a broad knowledge of plant biology, ecology, and sociology. Not only are the\n692\nChapter 26 \u2022 Seed Plants\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nplant specimens studied and collected, but also the stories, recipes, and traditions that are linked to them. For ethnobotanists,\nplants are not viewed solely as biological organisms to be studied in a laboratory, but as an integral part of human culture. The\nconvergence of molecular biology, anthropology, and ecology make the field of ethnobotany a truly multidisciplinary science.\nBiodiversity of Plants\nBiodiversity ensures a resource for new food crops and medicines. Plant life balances ecosystems, protects watersheds,\nmitigates erosion, moderates our climate, and provides shelter for many animal species. Threats to plant diversity, however,\ncome from many sources. The explosion of the human population, especially in tropical countries where birth rates are highest\nand economic development is in full swing, is leading to devastating human encroachment into forested areas. To feed the\ngrowing population, humans need to obtain arable land, so there has been and continues to be massive clearing of trees. The\nneed for more energy to power larger cities and economic growth therein leads to the construction of dams, the consequent\nflooding of ecosystems, and increased emissions of pollutants. Other threats to tropical forests come from poachers, who log\ntrees for their precious wood. Ebony and Brazilian rosewood, both on the endangered list, are examples of tree species driven\nalmost to extinction by indiscriminate logging. This unfortunate practice continues unabated today largely due to lack of\npopulation control and political willpower.\nThe number of plant species becoming extinct is increasing at an alarming rate. Because ecosystems are in a delicate balance,\nand seed plants maintain close symbiotic relationships with animals\u2014whether predators or pollinators\u2014the disappearance of a\nsingle plant can lead to the extinction of connected animal species. A real and pressing issue is that many plant species have not\nyet been catalogued, and so their place in the ecosystem is unknown. These unknown species are threatened by logging, habitat\ndestruction, and loss of pollinators. They may become extinct before we have the chance to begin to understand the possible\nimpacts from their disappearance. Efforts to preserve biodiversity take several lines of action, from preserving heirloom seeds\nto barcoding species. Heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations, as opposed to the\nseeds used for large-scale agricultural production. Barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences, taken\nfrom a well-characterized portion of DNA found in most genomes, are used to identify a species through DNA analysis.\n26.4 \u2022 The Role of Seed Plants\n693\n", "key_terms": "\nanther\nsac-like structure at the tip of the stamen in which\npollen grains are produced\nAnthophyta\nphylum to which angiosperms belong\nbarcoding\nmolecular biology technique in which one or\nmore short gene sequences taken from a well-\ncharacterized portion of the genome is used to identify a\nspecies\nbasal angiosperms\na group of plants that probably\nbranched off before the separation of monocots and\neudicots\ncalyx\nwhorl of sepals\ncarpel\nsingle unit of the pistil\nconifer\ndominant phylum of gymnosperms with the\ngreatest variety of trees\ncorolla\ncollection of petals\ncotyledon\nprimitive leaf that develops in the zygote;\nmonocots have one cotyledon, and dicots have two\ncotyledons\ncrop\ncultivated plant\ncycad\ngymnosperm that grows in tropical climates and\nresembles a palm tree; member of the phylum\nCycadophyta\ndicot\n(also, eudicot) related group of angiosperms whose\nembryos possess two cotyledons\ndioecious\ndescribes a species in which the male and female\nreproductive organs are carried on separate specimens\nfilament\nthin stalk that links the anther to the base of the\nflower\nflower\nbranches specialized for reproduction found in\nsome seed-bearing plants, containing either specialized\nmale or female organs or both male and female organs\nfruit\nthickened tissue derived from ovary wall that protects\nthe embryo after fertilization and facilitates seed\ndispersal\nginkgophyte\ngymnosperm with one extant species, the\nGinkgo biloba: a tree with fan-shaped leaves\ngnetophyte\ngymnosperm shrub with varied morphological\nfeatures that produces vessel elements in its woody\ntissues; the phylum includes the genera Ephedra,\nGnetum, and Welwitschia\ngymnosperm\nseed plant with naked seeds (seeds exposed\non modified leaves or in cones)\ngynoecium\n(also, carpel) structure that constitutes the\nfemale reproductive organ\nheirloom seed\nseed from a plant that was grown\nhistorically, but has not been used in modern agriculture\non a large scale\nherbaceous\ngrass-like plant noticeable by the absence of\nwoody tissue\nherbivory\nconsumption of plants by insects and other\nanimals\nintegument\nlayer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the\nmegasporangium, and later, the embryo\nmegasporocyte\nmegaspore mother cell; larger spore that\ngerminates into a female gametophyte in a heterosporous\nplant\nmicrosporocyte\nsmaller spore that produces a male\ngametophyte in a heterosporous plant\nmonocot\nrelated group of angiosperms that produce\nembryos with one cotyledon and pollen with a single\nridge\nmonoecious\ndescribes a species in which the male and\nfemale reproductive organs are on the same plant\nnectar\nliquid rich in sugars produced by flowers to attract\nanimal pollinators\novary\nchamber that contains and protects the ovule or\nfemale megasporangium\novulate cone\ncone containing two ovules per scale\novule\nfemale gametophyte\nperianth\npart of the plant consisting of the calyx (sepals)\nand corolla (petals)\npetal\nmodified leaf interior to the sepals; colorful petals\nattract animal pollinators\npistil\nfused group of carpels\npollen grain\nstructure containing the male gametophyte of\nthe plant\npollen tube\nextension from the pollen grain that delivers\nsperm to the egg cell\npollination\ntransfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma\nprogymnosperm\ntransitional group of plants that\nresembled conifers because they produced wood, yet still\nreproduced like ferns\nseed\nstructure containing the embryo, storage tissue, and\nprotective coat\nsepal\nmodified leaf that encloses the bud; outermost\nstructure of a flower\nspermatophyte\nseed plant; from the Greek sperm (seed)\nand phyte (plant)\nstamen\nstructure that contains the male reproductive\norgans\nstigma\nuppermost structure of the carpel where pollen is\ndeposited\nstrobilus\nplant structure with a tight arrangement of\nsporophylls around a central stalk, as seen in cones or\nflowers; the male strobilus produces pollen, and the\nfemale strobilus produces eggs\nstyle\nlong, thin structure that links the stigma to the ovary\n694\nChapter 26 \u2022 Key Terms\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n26.1 Evolution of Seed Plants\nSeed plants appeared about 350 million years ago, during the\nCarboniferous period. Two major innovations were seeds\nand pollen. Seeds protect the embryo from desiccation and\nprovide it with a store of nutrients to support the early\ngrowth of the sporophyte. Seeds are also equipped to delay\ngermination until growth conditions are optimal. Pollen\nallows seed plants to reproduce in the absence of water. The\ngametophytes of seed plants shrank, while the sporophytes\nbecame prominent structures and the diploid stage became\nthe longest phase of the life cycle.\nIn the gymnosperms, which appeared during the drier\nPermian period and became the dominant group during the\nTriassic, pollen was dispersed by wind, and their naked seeds\ndeveloped in the sporophylls of a strobilus. Angiosperms\nbear both flowers and fruit. Flowers expand the possibilities\nfor pollination, especially by insects, who have coevolved\nwith the flowering plants. Fruits offer additional protection\nto the embryo during its development, and also assist with\nseed dispersal. Angiosperms appeared during the Mesozoic\nera and have become the dominant plant life in terrestrial\nhabitats.\n26.2 Gymnosperms\nGymnosperms are heterosporous seed plants that produce\nnaked seeds. They appeared in the Paleozoic period and were\nthe dominant plant life during the Mesozoic. Modern-day\ngymnosperms belong to four phyla. The largest phylum,\nConiferophyta, is represented by conifers, the predominant\nplants at high altitude and latitude. Cycads (phylum\nCycadophyta) resemble palm trees and grow in tropical\nclimates. Ginkgophyta is represented today by a single\nspecies, Ginkgo biloba. The last phylum, Gnetophyta, is a\ndiverse group of plants that produce vessel elements in their\nwood.\n26.3 Angiosperms\nAngiosperms are the dominant form of plant life in most\nterrestrial ecosystems, comprising about 90 percent of all\nplant species. Most crops and ornamental plants are\nangiosperms. Their success comes from two innovative\nstructures that protect reproduction from variability in the\nenvironment: the flower and the fruit. Flowers were derived\nfrom modified leaves; their color and fragrance encourages\nspecies-specific pollination. The main parts of a flower are\nthe sepals and petals, which protect the reproductive parts:\nthe stamens and the carpels. The stamens produce the male\ngametes in pollen grains. The carpels contain the female\ngametes (the eggs inside the ovules), which are within the\novary of a carpel. The walls of the ovary thicken after\nfertilization, ripening into fruit that ensures dispersal by\nwind, water, or animals.\nThe angiosperm life cycle is dominated by the sporophyte\nstage. Double fertilization is an event unique to\nangiosperms. One sperm in the pollen fertilizes the egg,\nforming a diploid zygote, while the other combines with the\ntwo polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that develops into a\nfood storage tissue called the endosperm. Flowering plants\nare divided into two main groups, the monocots and\neudicots, according to the number of cotyledons in the\nseedlings. Basal angiosperms belong to an older lineage than\nmonocots and eudicots.\n26.4 The Role of Seed Plants\nAngiosperm diversity is due in part to multiple interactions\nwith animals. Herbivory has favored the development of\ndefense mechanisms in plants, and avoidance of those\ndefense mechanisms in animals. Conversely, seed dispersal\ncan be aided by animals that eat plant fruits. Pollination (the\ntransfer of pollen to a carpel) is mainly carried out by wind\nand animals, and angiosperm fruits and seeds have evolved\nnumerous adaptations to capture the wind or attract specific\nclasses of animals.\nPlants play a key role in ecosystems. They are a source of food\nand medicinal compounds, and provide raw materials for\nmany industries. Rapid deforestation and industrialization,\nhowever, threaten plant biodiversity.

Since then, animals have evolved into a highly\ndiverse kingdom. Although over one million extant (currently living) species of animals have been\nidentified, scientists are continually discovering more species as they explore ecosystems around the\nworld. The number of extant species is estimated to be between 3 and 30 million.\nBut what is an animal? While we can easily identify dogs, birds, fish, spiders, and worms as animals,\nother organisms, such as corals and sponges, are not as easy to classify. Animals vary in\ncomplexity\u2014from sea sponges to crickets to chimpanzees\u2014and scientists are faced with the difficult\ntask of classifying them within a unified system. They must identify traits that are common to all\nanimals as well as traits that can be used to distinguish among related groups of animals. The animal\nclassification system characterizes animals based on their anatomy, morphology, evolutionary history,\nfeatures of embryological development, and genetic makeup. This classification scheme is constantly\ndeveloping as new information about species arises. Understanding and classifying the great variety of\nliving species help us better understand how to conserve the diversity of life on earth.\nChapter Outline\n27.1 Features of the\nAnimal Kingdom\n27.2 Features Used to\nClassify Animals\n27.3 Animal Phylogeny\n27.4 The Evolutionary\nHistory of the\nAnimal Kingdom\ndifferent cellular histories as eukaryotes. The opisthokonts share the possession of a single posterior\nflagellum in flagellated cells, e.g., sperm cells.\nMost animals also share other features that distinguish them from organisms in other kingdoms. All\nanimals require a source of food and are therefore heterotrophic, ingesting other living or dead organisms.\nThis feature distinguishes them from autotrophic organisms, such as most plants, which synthesize their\nown nutrients through photosynthesis. As heterotrophs, animals may be carnivores, herbivores, omnivores,\nor parasites (Figure 27.2a,b). As with plants, almost all animals have a complex tissue structure with\ndifferentiated and specialized tissues. The necessity to collect food has made most animals motile, at least\nduring certain life stages. The typical life cycle in animals is diplontic (like you, the diploid state is\nmulticellular, whereas the haploid state is gametic, such as sperm or egg). We should note that the\nalternation of generations characteristic of the land plants is typically not found in animals. In animals\nwhose life histories include several to multiple body forms (e.g., insect larvae or the medusae of some\nCnidarians), all body forms are diploid. Animal embryos pass through a series of developmental stages that\nestablish a determined and fixed body plan. The body plan refers to the morphology of an animal,\ndetermined by developmental cues.\nFigure 27.2 Heterotrophy. All animals are heterotrophs and thus derive energy from a variety of food sources. The (a)\nblack bear is an omnivore, eating both plants and animals. The (b) heartworm Dirofilaria immitis is a parasite that\nderives energy from its hosts. It spends its larval stage in mosquitoes and its adult stage infesting the heart of dogs\nand other mammals, as shown here. (credit a: modification of work by USDA Forest Service; credit b: modification of\nwork by Clyde Robinson)\nComplex Tissue Structure\nMany of the specialized tissues of animals are associated with the requirements and hazards of seeking and\nprocessing food. This explains why animals typically have evolved special structures associated with specific\nmethods of food capture and complex digestive systems supported by accessory organs. Sensory structures\nhelp animals navigate their environment, detect food sources (and avoid becoming a food source for other\nanimals!). Movement is driven by muscle tissue attached to supportive structures like bone or chitin, and is\ncoordinated by neural communication. Animal cells may also have unique structures for intercellular\ncommunication (such as gap junctions). The evolution of nerve tissues and muscle tissues has resulted in\nanimals\u2019 unique ability to rapidly sense and respond to changes in their environment. This allows animals to\nsurvive in environments where they must compete with other species to meet their nutritional demands.\nThe tissues of animals differ from those of the other major multicellular eukaryotes, plants and fungi,\nbecause their cells don't have cell walls. However, cells of animal tissues may be embedded in an extracellular\nmatrix (e.g., mature bone cells reside within a mineralized organic matrix secreted by the cells). In\nvertebrates, bone tissue is a type of connective tissue that supports the entire body structure. The complex\nbodies and activities of vertebrates demand such supportive tissues. Epithelial tissues cover and protect\nboth external and internal body surfaces, and may also have secretory functions. Epithelial tissues include\nthe epidermis of the integument, the lining of the digestive tract and trachea, as well as the layers of cells\nthat make up the ducts of the liver and glands of advanced animals, for example. The different types of\n700\nChapter 27 \u2022 Introduction to Animal Diversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ntissues in true animals are responsible for carrying out specific functions for the organism. This differentiation and\nspecialization of tissues is part of what allows for such incredible animal diversity.\nJust as there are multiple ways to be a eukaryote, there are multiple ways to be a multicellular animal. The animal kingdom is\ncurrently divided into five monophyletic clades: Parazoa or Porifera (sponges), Placozoa (tiny parasitic creatures that resemble\nmulticellular amoebae), Cnidaria (jellyfish and their relatives), Ctenophora (the comb jellies), and Bilateria (all other animals).\nThe Placozoa (\"flat animal\") and Parazoa (\u201cbeside animal\u201d) do not have specialized tissues derived from germ layers of the\nembryo; although they do possess specialized cells that act functionally like tissues. The Placozoa have only four cell types, while\nthe sponges have nearly two dozen. The three other clades do include animals with specialized tissues derived from the germ\nlayers of the embryo. In spite of their superficial similarity to Cnidarian medusae, recent molecular studies indicate that the\nCtenophores are only distantly related to the Cnidarians, which together with the Bilateria constitute the Eumetazoa (\"true\nanimals\"). When we think of animals, we usually think of Eumetazoa, since most animals fall into this category.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch a presentation (http://openstax.org/l/saving_life) by biologist E.O. Wilson on the importance of diversity.\nAnimal Reproduction and Development\nMost animals are diploid organisms, meaning that their body (somatic) cells are diploid and haploid reproductive (gamete) cells\nare produced through meiosis. Some exceptions exist: for example, in bees, wasps, and ants, the male is haploid because it\ndevelops from unfertilized eggs. Most animals undergo sexual reproduction. However, a few groups, such as cnidarians,\nflatworms, and roundworms, may also undergo asexual reproduction, in which offspring originate from part of the parental\nbody.\nProcesses of Animal Reproduction and Embryonic Development\nDuring sexual reproduction, the haploid gametes of the male and female individuals of a species combine in a process called\nfertilization. Typically, both male and female gametes are required: the small, motile male sperm fertilizes the typically much\nlarger, sessile female egg. This process produces a diploid fertilized egg called a zygote.\nSome animal species\u2014including sea stars and sea anemones\u2014are capable of asexual reproduction. The most common forms of\nasexual reproduction for stationary aquatic animals include budding and fragmentation, where part of a parent individual can\nseparate and grow into a new individual. This type of asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring, which\nwould appear to be disadvantageous from the perspective of evolutionary adaptability, simply because of the potential buildup\nof deleterious mutations.\nIn contrast, a form of uniparental reproduction found in some insects and a few vertebrates is called parthenogenesis (or \u201cvirgin\nbeginning\u201d). In this case, progeny develop from a gamete, but without fertilization. Because of the nutrients stored in eggs, only\nfemales produce parthenogenetic offspring. In some insects, unfertilized eggs develop into new male offspring. This type of sex\ndetermination is called haplodiploidy, since females are diploid (with both maternal and paternal chromosomes) and males are\nhaploid (with only maternal chromosomes). A few vertebrates, e.g., some fish, turkeys, rattlesnakes, and whiptail lizards, are\nalso capable of parthenogenesis. In the case of turkeys and rattlesnakes, parthenogenetically reproducing females also produce\nonly male offspring, but not because the males are haploid. In birds and rattlesnakes, the female is the heterogametic (ZW) sex,\nso the only surviving progeny of post-meiotic parthenogenesis would be ZZ males. In the whiptail lizards, on the other hand,\nonly female progeny are produced by parthenogenesis. These animals may not be identical to their parent, although they have\nonly maternal chromosomes. However, for animals that are limited in their access to mates, uniparental reproduction can\nensure genetic propagation.\nIn animals, the zygote progresses through a series of developmental stages, during which primary germ layers (ectoderm,\nendoderm, and mesoderm) are established and reorganize to form an embryo. During this process, animal tissues begin to\nspecialize and organize into organs and organ systems, determining their future morphology and physiology.\nAnimal development begins with cleavage, a series of mitotic cell divisions, of the zygote (Figure 27.3). Cleavage differs from\nsomatic cell division in that the egg is subdivided by successive cleavages into smaller and smaller cells, with no actual cell\ngrowth. The cells resulting from subdivision of the material of the egg in this way are called blastomeres. Three cell divisions\ntransform the single-celled zygote into an eight-celled structure. After further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells,\na solid morula is formed, followed by a hollow structure called a blastula. The blastula is hollow only in invertebrates whose eggs\n27.1 \u2022 Features of the Animal Kingdom\n701\nhave relatively small amounts of yolk. In very yolky eggs of vertebrates, the yolk remains undivided, with most cells forming an\nembryonic layer on the surface of the yolk (imagine a chicken embryo growing over the egg\u2019s yolk), which serve as food for the\ndeveloping embryo.\nFurther cell division and cellular rearrangement leads to a process called gastrulation. Gastrulation results in two important\nevents: the formation of the primitive gut (archenteron) or digestive cavity, and the formation of the embryonic germ layers, as\nwe have discussed above. These germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types, organs, and organ systems\nduring a process called organogenesis. Diploblastic organisms have two germ layers, endoderm and ectoderm. Endoderm\nforms the wall of the digestive tract, and ectoderm covers the surface of the animal. In triploblastic animals, a third layer forms:\nmesoderm, which differentiates into various structures between the ectoderm and endoderm, including the lining of the body\ncavity.\nFigure 27.3 Development of a simple embryo. During embryonic development, the zygote undergoes a series of mitotic cell divisions, or\ncleavages, that subdivide the egg into smaller and smaller blastomeres. Note that the 8-cell stage and the blastula are about the same size\nas the original zygote. In many invertebrates, the blastula consists of a single layer of cells around a hollow space. During a process called\ngastrulation, the cells from the blastula move inward on one side to form an inner cavity. This inner cavity becomes the primitive gut\n(archenteron) of the gastrula (\"little gut\") stage. The opening into this cavity is called the blastopore, and in some invertebrates it is\ndestined to form the mouth.\nSome animals produce larval forms that are different from the adult. In insects with incomplete metamorphosis, such as\ngrasshoppers, the young resemble wingless adults, but gradually produce larger and larger wing buds during successive molts,\nuntil finally producing functional wings and sex organs during the last molt. Other animals, such as some insects and\nechinoderms, undergo complete metamorphosis in which the embryo develops into one or more feeding larval stages that may\ndiffer greatly in structure and function from the adult (Figure 27.4). The adult body then develops from one or more regions of\nlarval tissue. For animals with complete metamorphosis, the larva and the adult may have different diets, limiting competition\nfor food between them. Regardless of whether a species undergoes complete or incomplete metamorphosis, the series of\ndevelopmental stages of the embryo remains largely the same for most members of the animal kingdom.\n702\nChapter 27 \u2022 Introduction to Animal Diversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 27.4 Insect metamorphosis.

Surprisingly, a human embryo and a frog embryo, at a certain stage of\nembryonic development, look remarkably alike! For a long time, scientists did not understand why so many animal species\nlooked similar during embryonic development but were very different as adults. They wondered what dictated the\ndevelopmental direction that a fly, mouse, frog, or human embryo would take. Near the end of the twentieth century, a\nparticular class of genes was discovered that had this very job. These genes that determine animal structure are called \u201chomeotic\ngenes,\u201d and they contain DNA sequences called homeoboxes. Genes with homeoboxes encode protein transcription factors. One\ngroup of animal genes containing homeobox sequences is specifically referred to as Hox genes. This cluster of genes is\nresponsible for determining the general body plan, such as the number of body segments of an animal, the number and\nplacement of appendages, and animal head-tail directionality. The first Hox genes to be sequenced were those from the fruit fly\n(Drosophila melanogaster). A single Hox mutation in the fruit fly can result in an extra pair of wings or even legs growing from\nthe head in place of antennae (this is because antennae and legs are embryologic homologous structures and their appearance as\nantennae or legs is dictated by their origination within specific body segments of the head and thorax during development).\nNow, Hox genes are known from virtually all other animals as well.\nWhile there are a great many genes that play roles in the morphological development of an animal, including other homeobox-\ncontaining genes, what makes Hox genes so powerful is that they serve as \u201cmaster control genes\u201d that can turn on or off large\nnumbers of other genes. Hox genes do this by encoding transcription factors that control the expression of numerous other\ngenes. Hox genes are homologous across the animal kingdom, that is, the genetic sequences of Hox genes and their positions on\n27.1 \u2022 Features of the Animal Kingdom\n703\nchromosomes are remarkably similar across most animals because of their presence in a common ancestor, from worms to flies,\nmice, and humans (Figure 27.5). In addition, the order of the genes reflects the anterior-posterior axis of the animal's body. One\nof the contributions to increased animal body complexity is that Hox genes have undergone at least two and perhaps as many as\nfour duplication events during animal evolution, with the additional genes allowing for more complex body types to evolve. All\nvertebrates have four (or more) sets of Hox genes, while invertebrates have only one set.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 27.5 Hox genes. Hox genes are highly conserved genes encoding transcription factors that determine the course of embryonic\ndevelopment in animals. In vertebrates, the genes have been duplicated into four clusters on different chromosomes: Hox-A, Hox-B, Hox-C,\nand Hox-D. Genes within these clusters are expressed in certain body segments at certain stages of development. Shown here is the\nhomology between Hox genes in mice and humans. Note how Hox gene expression, as indicated with orange, pink, blue, and green shading,\noccurs in the same body segments in both the mouse and the human. While at least one copy of each Hox gene is present in humans and\nother vertebrates, some Hox genes are missing in some chromosomal sets.\nIf a Hox 13 gene in a mouse was replaced with a Hox 1 gene, how might this alter animal development?\nTwo of the five clades within the animal kingdom do not have Hox genes: the Ctenophora and the Porifera. In spite of the\nsuperficial similarities between the Cnidaria and the Ctenophora, the Cnidaria have a number of Hox genes, but the Ctenophora\nhave none. The absence of Hox genes from the ctenophores has led to the suggestion that they might be \u201cbasal\u201d animals, in spite\nof their tissue differentiation. Ironically, the Placozoa, which have only a few cell types, do have at least one Hox gene. The\npresence of a Hox gene in the Placozoa, in addition to similarities in the genomic organization of the Placozoa, Cnidaria and\nBilateria, has led to the inclusion of the three groups in a \u201cParahoxozoa\u201d clade. However, we should note that at this time the\nreclassification of the Animal Kingdom is still tentative and requires much more study.\n27.2 Features Used to Classify Animals\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain the differences in animal body plans that support basic animal classification\n\u2022\nCompare and contrast the embryonic development of protostomes and deuterostomes\nScientists have developed a classification scheme that categorizes all members of the animal kingdom, although there are\nexceptions to most \u201crules\u201d governing animal classification (Figure 27.6). Animals have been traditionally classified according to\ntwo characteristics: body plan and developmental pathway. The major feature of the body plan is its symmetry: how the body\nparts are distributed along the major body axis. Symmetrical animals can be divided into roughly equivalent halves along at\nleast one axis. Developmental characteristics include the number of germ tissue layers formed during development, the origin\nof the mouth and anus, the presence or absence of an internal body cavity, and other features of embryological development,\nsuch as larval types or whether or not periods of growth are interspersed with molting.\n704\nChapter 27 \u2022 Introduction to Animal Diversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 27.6 Animal phylogeny. The phylogenetic tree of animals is based on morphological, fossil, and genetic evidence. The Ctenophora\nand Porifera are both considered to be basal because of the absence of Hox genes in this group, but how they are related to the\n\u201cParahoxozoa\u201d (Placozoa + Eumetazoa) or to each other, continues to be a matter of debate.\nWhich of the following statements is false?\na.\nEumetazoans have specialized tissues and parazoans don\u2019t.\nb.\nLophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa are both Bilataria.\nc.\nAcoela and Cnidaria both possess radial symmetry.\nd.\nArthropods are more closely related to nematodes than they are to annelids.\nAnimal Characterization Based on Body Symmetry\nAt a very basic level of classification, true animals can be largely divided into three groups based on the type of symmetry of\ntheir body plan: radially symmetrical, bilaterally symmetrical, and asymmetrical. Asymmetry is seen in two modern clades, the\nParazoa (Figure 27.7a) and Placozoa. (Although we should note that the ancestral fossils of the Parazoa apparently exhibited\nbilateral symmetry.) One clade, the Cnidaria (Figure 27.7b,c), exhibits radial or biradial symmetry: Ctenophores have rotational\nsymmetry (Figure 27.7e). Bilateral symmetry is seen in the largest of the clades, the Bilateria (Figure 27.7d); however the\nEchinodermata are bilateral as larvae and metamorphose secondarily into radial adults. All types of symmetry are well suited to\n27.2 \u2022 Features Used to Classify Animals\n705\nmeet the unique demands of a particular animal\u2019s lifestyle.\nRadial symmetry is the arrangement of body parts around a central axis, as is seen in a bicycle wheel or pie. It results in animals\nhaving top and bottom surfaces but no left and right sides, nor front or back. If a radially symmetrical animal is divided in any\ndirection along the oral/aboral axis (the side with a mouth is \u201coral side,\u201d and the side without a mouth is the \u201caboral side\u201d), the\ntwo halves will be mirror images. This form of symmetry marks the body plans of many animals in the phyla Cnidaria, including\njellyfish and adult sea anemones (Figure 27.7b, c). Radial symmetry equips these sea creatures (which may be sedentary or only\ncapable of slow movement or floating) to experience the environment equally from all directions. Bilaterally symmetrical\nanimals, like butterflies (Figure 27.7d) have only a single plane along which the body can be divided into equivalent halves. The\nCtenophora (Figure 27.7e), although they look similar to jellyfish, are considered to have rotational symmetry rather than radial\nor biradial symmetry because division of the body into two halves along the oral/aboral axis divides them into two copies of the\nsame half, with one copy rotated 180o, rather than two mirror images.\nFigure 27.7 Symmetry in animals. The (a) sponge is asymmetrical. The (b) jellyfish and (c) anemone are radially symmetrical, the (d)\nbutterfly is bilaterally symmetrical. Rotational symmetry (e) is seen in the ctenophore Beroe, shown swimming open-mouthed. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Andrew Turner; credit b: modification of work by Robert Freiburger; credit c: modification of work by Samuel Chow;\ncredit d: modification of work by Cory Zanker; credit e: modification of work by NOAA)\nBilateral symmetry involves the division of the animal through a midsagittal plane, resulting in two superficially mirror images,\nright and left halves, such as those of a butterfly (Figure 27.7d), crab, or human body. Animals with bilateral symmetry have a\n\u201chead\u201d and \u201ctail\u201d (anterior vs. posterior), front and back (dorsal vs. ventral), and right and left sides (Figure 27.8). All Eumetazoa\nexcept those with secondary radial symmetry are bilaterally symmetrical. The evolution of bilateral symmetry that allowed for\nthe formation of anterior and posterior (head and tail) ends promoted a phenomenon called cephalization, which refers to the\ncollection of an organized nervous system at the animal\u2019s anterior end. In contrast to radial symmetry, which is best suited for\nstationary or limited-motion lifestyles, bilateral symmetry allows for streamlined and directional motion. In evolutionary\nterms, this simple form of symmetry promoted active and controlled directional mobility and increased sophistication of\nresource-seeking and predator-prey relationships.\n706\nChapter 27 \u2022 Introduction to Animal Diversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 27.8 Bilateral symmetry. The bilaterally symmetrical human body can be divided by several planes.\nAnimals in the phylum Echinodermata (such as sea stars, sand dollars, and sea urchins) display modified radial symmetry as\nadults, but as we have noted, their larval stages (such as the bipinnaria) initially exhibit bilateral symmetry until they\nmetamorphose in animals with radial symmetry (this is termed secondary radial symmetry). Echinoderms evolved from\nbilaterally symmetrical animals; thus, they are classified as bilaterally symmetrical.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video to see a quick sketch of the different types of body symmetry.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/symmetry)\nAnimal Characterization Based on Features of Embryological Development\nMost animal species undergo a separation of tissues into germ layers during embryonic development. Recall that these germ\nlayers are formed during gastrulation, and that each germ layer typically gives rise to specific types of embryonic tissues and\norgans. Animals develop either two or three embryonic germ layers (Figure 27.9). The animals that display radial, biradial, or\nrotational symmetry develop two germ layers, an inner layer (endoderm or mesendoderm) and an outer layer (ectoderm). These\nanimals are called diploblasts, and have a nonliving middle layer between the endoderm and ectoderm (although individual cells\nmay be distributed through this middle layer, there is no coherent third layer of tissue). The four clades considered to be\ndiploblastic have different levels of complexity and different developmental pathways, although there is little information about\ndevelopment in Placozoa. More complex animals (usually those with bilateral symmetry) develop three tissue layers: an inner\nlayer (endoderm), an outer layer (ectoderm), and a middle layer (mesoderm). Animals with three tissue layers are called\ntriploblasts.\n27.2 \u2022 Features Used to Classify Animals\n707\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 27.9 Diploblastic and triploblastic embryos. During embryogenesis, diploblasts develop two embryonic germ layers: an ectoderm\nand an endoderm or mesendoderm. Triploblasts develop a third layer\u2014the mesoderm\u2014which arises from mesendoderm and resides\nbetween the endoderm and ectoderm.\nWhich of the following statements about diploblasts and triploblasts is false?\na.\nAnimals that display only radial symmetry during their lifespans are diploblasts.\nb.\nAnimals that display bilateral symmetry are triploblasts.\nc.\nThe endoderm gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract and the respiratory tract.\nd.\nThe mesoderm gives rise to the central nervous system.\nEach of the three germ layers is programmed to give rise to specific body tissues and organs, although there are variations on\nthese themes. Generally speaking, the endoderm gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract (including the stomach, intestines,\nliver, and pancreas), as well as to the lining of the trachea, bronchi, and lungs of the respiratory tract, along with a few other\nstructures. The ectoderm develops into the outer epithelial covering of the body surface, the central nervous system, and a few\nother structures. The mesoderm is the third germ layer; it forms between the endoderm and ectoderm in triploblasts. This germ\nlayer gives rise to all specialized muscle tissues (including the cardiac tissues and muscles of the intestines), connective tissues\nsuch as the skeleton and blood cells, and most other visceral organs such as the kidneys and the spleen. Diploblastic animals\nmay have cell types that serve multiple functions, such as epitheliomuscular cells, which serve as a covering as well as contractile\ncells.\nPresence or Absence of a Coelom\nFurther subdivision of animals with three germ layers (triploblasts) results in the separation of animals that may develop an\ninternal body cavity derived from mesoderm, called a coelom, and those that do not. This epithelial cell-lined coelomic cavity,\nusually filled with fluid, lies between the visceral organs and the body wall. It houses many organs such as the digestive, urinary,\nand reproductive systems, the heart and lungs, and also contains the major arteries and veins of the circulatory system. In\nmammals, the body cavity is divided into the thoracic cavity, which houses the heart and lungs, and the abdominal cavity, which\nhouses the digestive organs. In the thoracic cavity further subdivision produces the pleural cavity, which provides space for the\nlungs to expand during breathing, and the pericardial cavity, which provides room for movements of the heart. The evolution of\nthe coelom is associated with many functional advantages. For example, the coelom provides cushioning and shock absorption\nfor the major organ systems that it encloses. In addition, organs housed within the coelom can grow and move freely, which\npromotes optimal organ development and placement. The coelom also provides space for the diffusion of gases and nutrients, as\nwell as body flexibility, promoting improved animal motility.\nTriploblasts that do not develop a coelom are called acoelomates, and their mesoderm region is completely filled with tissue,\nalthough they do still have a gut cavity. Examples of acoelomates include animals in the phylum Platyhelminthes, also known as\nflatworms. Animals with a true coelom are called eucoelomates (or coelomates) (Figure 27.10). In such cases, a true coelom\narises entirely within the mesoderm germ layer and is lined by an epithelial membrane. This membrane also lines the organs\nwithin the coelom, connecting and holding them in position while allowing them some freedom of movement. Annelids,\nmollusks, arthropods, echinoderms, and chordates are all eucoelomates. A third group of triploblasts has a slightly different\n708\nChapter 27 \u2022 Introduction to Animal Diversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncoelom lined partly by mesoderm and partly by endoderm. Although still functionally a coelom, these are considered \u201cfalse\u201d\ncoeloms, and so we call these animals pseudocoelomates. The phylum Nematoda (roundworms) is an example of a\npseudocoelomate. True coelomates can be further characterized based on other features of their early embryological\ndevelopment.\nFigure 27.10 Body cavities. Triploblasts may be (a) acoelomates, (b) eucoelomates, or (c) pseudocoelomates. Acoelomates have no body\ncavity. Eucoelomates have a body cavity within the mesoderm, called a coelom, in which both the gut and the body wall are lined with\nmesoderm. Pseudocoelomates also have a body cavity, but only the body wall is lined with mesoderm. (credit a: modification of work by\nJan Derk; credit b: modification of work by NOAA; credit c: modification of work by USDA, ARS)\nEmbryonic Development of the Mouth\nBilaterally symmetrical, tribloblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in the origin of\nthe mouth. When the primitive gut forms, the opening that first connects the gut cavity to the outside of the embryo is called\nthe blastopore. Most animals have openings at both ends of the gut: mouth at one end and anus at the other. One of these\nopenings will develop at or near the site of the blastopore. In Protostomes (\"mouth first\"), the mouth develops at the blastopore\n(Figure 27.11). In Deuterostomes (\"mouth second\"), the mouth develops at the other end of the gut (Figure 27.11) and the anus\ndevelops at the site of the blastopore. Protostomes include arthropods, mollusks, and annelids. Deuterostomes include more\ncomplex animals such as chordates but also some \u201csimple\u201d animals such as echinoderms. Recent evidence has challenged this\nsimple view of the relationship between the location of the blastopore and the formation of the mouth, however, and the theory\nremains under debate. Nevertheless, these details of mouth and anus formation reflect general differences in the organization\nof protostome and deuterostome embryos, which are also expressed in other developmental features.\nOne of these differences between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation, beginning from the\ngastrula stage. Since body cavity formation tends to accompany the formation of the mesoderm, the mesoderm of protostomes\nand deuterostomes forms differently. The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely. The\nmesoderm in these organisms is usually the product of specific blastomeres, which migrate into the interior of the embryo and\nform two clumps of mesodermal tissue. Within each clump, cavities develop and merge to form the hollow opening of the\ncoelom. Deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely. Here, the mesoderm develops as\npouches that are pinched off from the endoderm tissue. These pouches eventually fuse and expand to fill the space between the\ngut and the body wall, giving rise to the coelom.\nAnother difference in organization of protostome and deuterostome embryos is expressed during cleavage. Protostomes\nundergo spiral cleavage, meaning that the cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated, and thus misaligned, with respect to the\n27.2 \u2022 Features Used to Classify Animals\n709\ncells of the opposite pole. This is due to the oblique angle of cleavage relative to the two poles of the embryo. Deuterostomes\nundergo radial cleavage, where the cleavage axes are either parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis, resulting in the parallel\n(up-and-down) alignment of the cells between the two poles.\nFigure 27.11 Protostomes and deuterostomes. Eucoelomates can be divided into two groups based on their early embryonic development.\nIn protostomes, the mouth forms at or near the site of the blastopore and the body cavity forms by splitting the mesodermal mass during\nthe process of schizocoely. In deuterostomes, the mouth forms at a site opposite the blastopore end of the embryo and the mesoderm\npinches off to form the coelom during the process of enterocoely.\nA second distinction between the types of cleavage in protostomes and deuterostomes relates to the fate of the resultant\nblastomeres (cells produced by cleavage). In addition to spiral cleavage, protostomes also undergo determinate cleavage. This\nmeans that even at this early stage, the developmental fate of each embryonic cell is already determined. A given cell does not\nhave the ability to develop into any cell type other than its original destination. Removal of a blastomere from an embryo with\ndeterminate cleavage can result in missing structures, and embryos that fail to develop. In contrast, deuterostomes undergo\nindeterminate cleavage, in which cells are not yet fully committed at this early stage to develop into specific cell types. Removal\nof individual blastomeres from these embryos does not result in the loss of embryonic structures. In fact, twins (clones) can be\nproduced as a result from blastomeres that have been separated from the original mass of blastomere cells. Unlike protostomes,\nhowever, if some blastomeres are damaged during embryogenesis, adjacent cells are able to compensate for the missing cells,\nand the embryo is not damaged. These cells are referred to as undetermined cells. This characteristic of deuterostomes is\nreflected in the existence of familiar embryonic stem cells, which have the ability to develop into any cell type until their fate is\nprogrammed at a later developmental stage.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThe Evolution of the Coelom\nOne of the first steps in the classification of animals is to examine the animal\u2019s body. One structure that is used in classification\nof animals is the body cavity or coelom. The body cavity develops within the mesoderm, so only triploblastic animals can have\nbody cavities. Therefore body cavities are found only within the Bilateria. In other animal clades, the gut is either close to the\nbody wall or separated from it by a jelly-like material. The body cavity is important for two reasons. Fluid within the body cavity\nprotects the organs from shock and compression. In addition, since in triploblastic embryos, most muscle, connective tissue,\nand blood vessels develop from mesoderm, these tissues developing within the lining of the body cavity can reinforce the gut\nand body wall, aid in motility, and efficiently circulate nutrients.\nTo recap what we have discussed above, animals that do not have a coelom are called acoelomates. The major acoelomate group\nin the Bilateria is the flatworms, including both free-living and parasitic forms such as tapeworms. In these animals,\n710\nChapter 27 \u2022 Introduction to Animal Diversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nmesenchyme fills the space between the gut and the body wall. Although two layers of muscle are found just under the\nepidermis, there is no muscle or other mesodermal tissue around the gut. Flatworms rely on passive diffusion for nutrient\ntransport across their body.\nIn pseudocoelomates, there is a body cavity between the gut and the body wall, but only the body wall has mesodermal tissue. In\nthese animals, the mesoderm forms, but does not develop cavities within it. Major pseudocoelomate phyla are the rotifers and\nnematodes. Animals that have a true coelom are called eucoelomates; all vertebrates, as well as molluscs, annelids, arthropods,\nand echinoderms, are eucoelomates. The coelom develops within the mesoderm during embryogenesis. Of the major bilaterian\nphyla, the molluscs, annelids, and arthropods are schizocoels, in which the mesoderm splits to form the body cavity, while the\nechinoderms and chordates are enterocoels, in which the mesoderm forms as two or more buds off of the gut. These buds\nseparate from the gut and coalesce to form the body cavity. In the vertebrates, mammals have a subdivided body cavity, with the\nthoracic cavity separated from the abdominal cavity. The pseudocoelomates may have had eucoelomate ancestors and may have\nlost their ability to form a complete coelom through genetic mutations. Thus, this step in early embryogenesis\u2014the formation of\nthe coelom\u2014has had a large evolutionary impact on the various species of the animal kingdom.\n27.3 Animal Phylogeny\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nInterpret the metazoan phylogenetic tree\n\u2022\nDescribe the types of data that scientists use to construct and revise animal phylogeny\n\u2022\nList some of the relationships within the modern phylogenetic tree that have been discovered as a result of\nmodern molecular data\nBiologists strive to understand the evolutionary history and relationships of members of the animal kingdom, and all of life, for\nthat matter. The study of phylogeny (the branching sequence of evolution) aims to determine the evolutionary relationships\nbetween phyla. Currently, most biologists divide the animal kingdom into 35 to 40 phyla. Scientists develop phylogenetic trees,\nwhich serve as hypotheses about which species have evolved from which ancestors.\nRecall that until recently, only morphological characteristics and the fossil record were used to determine phylogenetic\nrelationships among animals. Scientific understanding of the distinctions and hierarchies between anatomical characteristics\nprovided much of this knowledge. Used alone, however, this information can be misleading. Morphological characteristics (such\nas skin color, body shape, etc.) may evolve multiple times, and independently, through evolutionary history. Analogous\ncharacteristics may appear similar between animals, but their underlying evolution may be very different. With the\nadvancement of molecular technologies, modern phylogenetics is now informed by genetic and molecular analyses, in addition\nto traditional morphological and fossil data. With a growing understanding of genetics, the animal evolutionary tree has\nchanged substantially and continues to change as new DNA and RNA analyses are performed on additional animal species.\nConstructing an Animal Phylogenetic Tree\nThe current understanding of evolutionary relationships among animal, or Metazoa, phyla begins with the distinction between\nanimals with true differentiated tissues, called Eumetazoa, and animal phyla that do not have true differentiated tissues, such\nas the sponges (Porifera) and the Placozoa. Similarities between the feeding cells of sponges (choanocytes) and choanoflagellate\nprotists (Figure 27.12) have been used to suggest that Metazoa evolved from a common ancestral organism that resembled the\nmoderncolonial choanoflagellates.\nFigure 27.12 Choanoflagellates and choanocytes. Cells of the protist choanoflagellate clade closely resemble sponge choanocyte cells.\n27.3 \u2022 Animal Phylogeny\n711\nBeating of choanocyte flagella draws water through the sponge so that nutrients can be extracted and waste removed.\nEumetazoa are subdivided into radially symmetrical animals and bilaterally symmetrical animals, and are thus classified into\nthe clades Bilateria and Radiata, respectively. As mentioned earlier, the cnidarians and ctenophores are animal phyla with true\nradial, biradial, or rotational symmetry. All other Eumetazoa are members of the Bilateria clade. The bilaterally symmetrical\nanimals are further divided into deuterostomes (including chordates and echinoderms) and two distinct clades of protostomes\n(including ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans) (Figure 27.13a,b). Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods; they are so\nnamed for a commonly found characteristic among the group: the physiological process of exoskeletal molting followed by the\n\u201cstripping\u201d of the outer cuticular layer, called ecdysis. Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features, each common to\ncertain phyla within the clade. Some lophotrochozoan phyla are characterized by a larval stage called trochophore larvae, and\nother phyla are characterized by the presence of a feeding structure called a lophophore (thus, the shorter term, \u201clopho-trocho-\nzoa\u201d).\nFigure 27.13 Ecdysozoa. Animals that molt their exoskeletons, such as these (a) Madagascar hissing cockroaches, are in the clade\nEcdysozoa. (b) Phoronids are in the clade Lophotrochozoa. The tentacles are part of a feeding structure called a lophophore.

Each year, new evidence\nemerges that further alters the relationships described by a phylogenetic tree diagram.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch the following video (http://openstax.org/l/build_phylogeny) to learn how biologists use genetic data to determine\nrelationships among organisms.\nNucleic acid and protein analyses have greatly modified and refined the modern phylogenetic animal tree. These data come\nfrom a variety of molecular sources, such as mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and certain cellular\nproteins. Many evolutionary relationships in the modern tree have only recently been determined from the molecular evidence.\nFor example, a previously classified group of animals called lophophorates, which included brachiopods and bryozoans, were\nlong-thought to be primitive deuterostomes. Extensive molecular analysis using rRNA data found these animals are actually\nprotostomes, more closely related to annelids and mollusks. This discovery allowed for the distinction of the protostome clade\nLophotrochozoa. Molecular data have also shed light on some differences within the lophotrochozoan group, and the placement\nof the Platyhelminthes is particularly problematic. Some scientists believe that the phyla Platyhelminthes and Rotifera should\nactually belong to their own clade of protostomes termed Platyzoa.\nMolecular research similar to the discoveries that brought about the distinction of the lophotrochozoan clade has also revealed a\ndramatic rearrangement of the relationships between mollusks, annelids, arthropods, and nematodes, and as a result, a new\n712\nChapter 27 \u2022 Introduction to Animal Diversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\necdysozoan clade was formed. Due to morphological similarities in their segmented body types, annelids and arthropods were\nonce thought to be closely related. However, molecular evidence has revealed that arthropods are actually more closely related to\nnematodes, now comprising the ecdysozoan clade, and annelids are more closely related to mollusks, brachiopods, and other\nphyla in the lophotrochozoan clade. These two clades now make up the protostomes.\nAnother change to former phylogenetic groupings because of modern molecular analyses includes the emergence of an entirely\nnew phylum of worm called Acoelomorpha. These acoel flatworms were long thought to belong to the phylum Platyhelminthes\nbecause of their similar \u201cflatworm\u201d morphology. However, molecular analyses revealed this to be a false relationship and\noriginally suggested that acoels represented living species of some of the earliest divergent bilaterians. More recent research\ninto the acoelomorphs has called this hypothesis into question and suggested that the acoels are more closely related to\ndeuterostomes. The placement of this new phylum remains disputed, but scientists agree that with sufficient molecular data,\ntheir true phylogeny will be determined.\nAnother example of phylogenetic reorganization involves the identification of the Ctenophora as the basal clade of the animal\nkingdom. Ctenophora, or comb jellies, were once considered to be a sister group of the Cnidaria, and the sponges (Porifera)\nwere placed as the basal animal group, sister to other animals. The presence of nerve and muscle cells in both the Ctenophores\nand the Cnidaria and their absence in the Porifera strengthened this view of the relationships among simple animal forms.\nHowever, recent molecular analysis has shown that many of the genes that support neural development in other animals are\nabsent from the Ctenophore genome. The muscle cells are restricted to the mouth and tentacles and are derived from cells in the\nmesoglea. The mitochondrial genome of the Ctenophores is small and lacks many genes found in other animal mitochondrial\ngenomes. These features plus the absence of Hox genes from the Ctenophores have been used to argue that the Ctenophores\nshould be considered basal or as a sister group of the Porifera, and that the evolution of specialized nerve and muscle tissue may\nhave occurred more than once in the history of animal life. Although Ctenophores have been shown as basal to other animals in\nthe phylogeny presented in Chapter 27.2, debate on this issue is likely to continue as Ctenophores are more closely studied.\nChanges to the phylogenetic tree can be difficult to track and understand, and are evidence of the process of science. Data and\nanalytical methods play a significant role in the development of phylogenies. For this reason \u2013 because molecular analysis and\nreanalysis are not complete -- we cannot necessarily dismiss a former phylogenetic tree as inaccurate. A recent reanalysis of\nmolecular evidence by an international group of evolutionary biologists refuted the proposition that comb jellies are the\nphylogenetically oldest extant metazoan group. The study, which relied on more sophisticated methods of analyzing the original\ngenetic data, reaffirms the traditional view that the sponges were indeed the first phylum to diverge from the common ancestor\nof metazoans. The ongoing discussion concerning the location of sponges and comb jellies on the animal \u201cfamily tree\u201d is an\nexample of what drives science forward.\n27.4 The Evolutionary History of the Animal Kingdom\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the features that characterized the earliest animals and approximately when they appeared on\nearth\n\u2022\nExplain the significance of the Cambrian period for animal evolution and the changes in animal diversity that\ntook place during that time\n\u2022\nDescribe some of the unresolved questions surrounding the Cambrian explosion\n\u2022\nDiscuss the implications of mass animal extinctions that have occurred in evolutionary history\nMany questions regarding the origins and evolutionary history of the animal kingdom continue to be researched and debated,\nas new fossil and molecular evidence change prevailing theories. Some of these questions include the following: How long have\nanimals existed on Earth? What were the earliest members of the animal kingdom, and what organism was their common\nancestor? While animal diversity increased during the Cambrian period of the Paleozoic era, 530 million years ago, modern\nfossil evidence suggests that primitive animal species existed much earlier.\nPre-Cambrian Animal Life\nThe time before the Cambrian period is known as the Ediacaran Period (from about 635 million years ago to 543 million years\nago), the final period of the late Proterozoic Neoproterozoic Era (Figure 27.14). Ediacaran fossils were first found in the\nEdiacaran hills of Southern Australia. There are no living representatives of these species, which have left impressions that look\nlike those of feathers or coins (Figure 27.15). It is believed that early animal life, termed Ediacaran biota, evolved from protists at\nthis time.\n27.4 \u2022 The Evolutionary History of the Animal Kingdom\n713\nFigure 27.14 An evolutionary timeline. (a) Earth\u2019s history is divided into eons, eras, and periods. Note that the Ediacaran period starts in the\nProterozoic eon and ends in the Cambrian period of the Phanerozoic eon.

(credit: modification of work by USGS)\nMost Ediacaran biota were just a few mm or cm long, but some of the feather-like forms could reach lengths of over a meter.\nRecently there has been increasing scientific evidence suggesting that more varied and complex animal species lived during this\ntime, and likely even before the Ediacaran period.\nFossils believed to represent the oldest animals with hard body parts were recently discovered in South Australia. These sponge-\nlike fossils, named Coronacollina acula, date back as far as 560 million years, and are believed to show the existence of hard body\nparts and spicules that extended 20\u201340 cm from the thimble-shaped body (estimated about 5 cm long). Other fossils from the\nEdiacaran period are shown in Figure 27.15a, b, c.\nFigure 27.15 Ediacaran fauna.

While the validity of this claim is still under\ninvestigation, these primitive fossils appear to be small, one-centimeter long, sponge-like creatures, irregularly shaped and\nwith internal tubes or canals. These ancient fossils from South Australia date back 650 million years, actually placing the\nputative animal before the great ice age extinction event that marked the transition between the Cryogenian period and the\nEdiacaran period. Until this discovery, most scientists believed that there was no animal life prior to the Ediacaran period. Many\nscientists now believe that animals may in fact have evolved during the Cryogenian period.\nThe Cambrian Explosion of Animal Life\nIf the fossils of the Ediacaran and Cryogenian periods are enigmatic, those of the following Cambrian period are far less so, and\ninclude body forms similar to those living today. The Cambrian period, occurring between approximately 542\u2013488 million years\nago, marks the most rapid evolution of new animal phyla and animal diversity in Earth\u2019s history. The rapid diversification of\nanimals that appeared during this period, including most of the animal phyla in existence today, is often referred to as the\nCambrian explosion (Figure 27.16). Animals resembling echinoderms, mollusks, worms, arthropods, and chordates arose\nduring this period. What may have been a top predator of this period was an arthropod-like creature named Anomalocaris, over\na meter long, with compound eyes and spiky tentacles. Obviously, all these Cambrian animals already exhibited complex\n714\nChapter 27 \u2022 Introduction to Animal Diversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nstructures, so their ancestors must have existed much earlier.\nFigure 27.16 Fauna of the Burgess Shale. An artist\u2019s rendition depicts some organisms from the Cambrian period. Anomalocaris is seen in\nthe upper left quadrant of the picture.\nOne of the most dominant species during the Cambrian period was the trilobite, an arthropod that was among the first animals\nto exhibit a sense of vision (Figure 27.17a,b,c,d). Trilobites were somewhat similar to modern horseshoe crabs. Thousands of\ndifferent species have been identified in fossil sediments of the Cambrian period; not a single species survives today.\nFigure 27.17 Trilobites. These fossils (a\u2013d) belong to trilobites, extinct arthropods that appeared in the early Cambrian period, 525 million\nyears ago, and disappeared from the fossil record during a mass extinction at the end of the Permian period, about 250 million years ago.\n27.4 \u2022 The Evolutionary History of the Animal Kingdom\n715\nThe cause of the Cambrian explosion is still debated, and in fact, it may be that a number of interacting causes ushered in this\nincredible explosion of animal diversity. For this reason, there are a number of hypotheses that attempt to answer this question.\nEnvironmental changes may have created a more suitable environment for animal life. Examples of these changes include rising\natmospheric oxygen levels (Figure 27.18) and large increases in oceanic calcium concentrations that preceded the Cambrian\nperiod. Some scientists believe that an expansive, continental shelf with numerous shallow lagoons or pools provided the\nnecessary living space for larger numbers of different types of animals to coexist. There is also support for hypotheses that argue\nthat ecological relationships between species, such as changes in the food web, competition for food and space, and predator-\nprey relationships, were primed to promote a sudden massive coevolution of species. Yet other hypotheses claim genetic and\ndevelopmental reasons for the Cambrian explosion. The morphological flexibility and complexity of animal development\nafforded by the evolution of Hox control genes may have provided the necessary opportunities for increases in possible animal\nmorphologies at the time of the Cambrian period. Hypotheses that attempt to explain why the Cambrian explosion happened\nmust be able to provide valid reasons for the massive animal diversification, as well as explain why it happened when it did.\nThere is evidence that both supports and refutes each of the hypotheses described above, and the answer may very well be a\ncombination of these and other theories.\nFigure 27.18 Atmospheric oxygen over time. The oxygen concentration in Earth\u2019s atmosphere rose sharply around 300 million years ago.\nHowever, unresolved questions about the animal diversification that took place during the Cambrian period remain. For\nexample, we do not understand how the evolution of so many species occurred in such a short period of time. Was there really\nan \u201cexplosion\u201d of life at this particular time? Some scientists question the validity of this idea, because there is increasing\nevidence to suggest that more animal life existed prior to the Cambrian period and that other similar species\u2019 so-called\nexplosions (or radiations) occurred later in history as well. Furthermore, the vast diversification of animal species that appears\nto have begun during the Cambrian period continued well into the following Ordovician period. Despite some of these\narguments, most scientists agree that the Cambrian period marked a time of impressively rapid animal evolution and\ndiversification of body forms that is unmatched for any other time period.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView an animation of what ocean life may have been like during the Cambrian explosion.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/ocean_life)\nPost-Cambrian Evolution and Mass Extinctions\nThe periods that followed the Cambrian during the Paleozoic Era are marked by further animal evolution and the emergence of\nmany new orders, families, and species. As animal phyla continued to diversify, new species adapted to new ecological niches.\nDuring the Ordovician period, which followed the Cambrian period, plant life first appeared on land. This change allowed\nformerly aquatic animal species to invade land, feeding directly on plants or decaying vegetation. Continual changes in\ntemperature and moisture throughout the remainder of the Paleozoic Era due to continental plate movements encouraged the\n716\nChapter 27 \u2022 Introduction to Animal Diversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ndevelopment of new adaptations to terrestrial existence in animals, such as limbed appendages in amphibians and epidermal\nscales in reptiles.\nChanges in the environment often create new niches (diversified living spaces) that invite rapid speciation and increased\ndiversity. On the other hand, cataclysmic events, such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life, can result in\ndevastating losses of diversity to some clades, yet provide new opportunities for others to \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d and speciate. Such\nperiods of mass extinction (Figure 27.19) have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life, erasing some genetic lines\nwhile creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind. The end of the Permian period (and the Paleozoic Era)\nwas marked by the largest mass extinction event in Earth\u2019s history, a loss of an estimated 95 percent of the extant species at that\ntime. Some of the dominant phyla in the world\u2019s oceans, such as the trilobites, disappeared completely. On land, the\ndisappearance of some dominant species of Permian reptiles made it possible for a new line of reptiles to emerge, the dinosaurs.\nThe warm and stable climatic conditions of the ensuing Mesozoic Era promoted an explosive diversification of dinosaurs into\nevery conceivable niche in land, air, and water. Plants, too, radiated into new landscapes and empty niches, creating complex\ncommunities of producers and consumers, some of which became very large on the abundant food available.\nAnother mass extinction event occurred at the end of the Cretaceous period, bringing the Mesozoic Era to an end. Skies\ndarkened and temperatures fell after a large meteor impact and tons of volcanic ash ejected into the atmosphere blocked\nincoming sunlight. Plants died, herbivores and carnivores starved, and the dinosaurs ceded their dominance of the landscape to\nthe more warm-blooded mammals. In the following Cenozoic Era, mammals radiated into terrestrial and aquatic niches once\noccupied by dinosaurs, and birds\u2014the warm-blooded direct descendants of one line of the ruling reptiles\u2014became aerial\nspecialists. The appearance and dominance of flowering plants in the Cenozoic Era created new niches for pollinating insects, as\nwell as for birds and mammals. Changes in animal species diversity during the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic were also\npromoted by a dramatic shift in Earth\u2019s geography, as continental plates slid over the crust into their current positions, leaving\nsome animal groups isolated on islands and continents, or separated by mountain ranges or inland seas from other\ncompetitors. Early in the Cenozoic, new ecosystems appeared, with the evolution of grasses and coral reefs. Late in the\nCenozoic, further extinctions followed by speciation occurred during ice ages that covered high latitudes with ice and then\nretreated, leaving new open spaces for colonization.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch the following video (http://openstax.org/l/mass_extinction) to learn more about the mass extinctions.\nFigure 27.19 Extinctions.

Paleontologists are scientists who study prehistoric life. They use fossils to observe and explain how life evolved on\nEarth and how species interacted with each other and with the environment. A paleontologist needs to be knowledgeable in\nmathematics, biology, ecology, chemistry, geology, and many other scientific disciplines. A paleontologist\u2019s work may involve\nfield studies: searching for and studying fossils. In addition to digging for and finding fossils, paleontologists also prepare\nfossils for further study and analysis. Although dinosaurs are probably the first animals that come to mind when thinking about\nancient life, paleontologists study a variety of life forms, from plants, fungi and invertebrates to the vertebrate fishes,\namphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.\nAn undergraduate degree in earth science or biology is a good place to start toward the career path of becoming a paleontologist.\nMost often, a graduate degree is necessary.

Although animals range in complexity from\nsimple sea sponges to human beings, most members of the\nanimal kingdom share certain features. Animals are\neukaryotic, multicellular, heterotrophic organisms that\ningest their food and usually develop into motile creatures\nwith a fixed body plan. A major characteristic unique to the\nanimal kingdom is the presence of differentiated tissues,\nsuch as nerve, muscle, and connective tissues, which are\nspecialized to perform specific functions. Most animals\nundergo sexual reproduction, leading to a series of\ndevelopmental embryonic stages that are relatively similar\nacross the animal kingdom. A class of transcriptional control\ngenes called Hox genes directs the organization of the major\nanimal body plans, and these genes are strongly homologous\nacross the animal kingdom.\n27.2 Features Used to Classify\nAnimals\nOrganisms in the animal kingdom are classified based on\ntheir body morphology, their developmental pathways, and\nChapter 27 \u2022 Key Terms\n719\ntheir genetic affinities. The relationships between the\nEumetazoa and more basal clades (Ctenophora, Porifera,\nand Placozoa) are still being debated. The Eumetazoa (\"true\nanimals\") are divided into those with radial versus bilateral\nsymmetry. Generally, the simpler and often nonmotile\nanimals display radial symmetry, which allows them to\nexplore their environment in all directions. Animals with\nradial symmetry are also generally characterized by the\ndevelopment of two embryological germ layers, the\nendoderm and ectoderm, whereas animals with bilateral\nsymmetry are generally characterized by the development of\na third embryologic germ layer, the mesoderm. Animals with\nthree germ layers, called triploblasts, are further\ncharacterized by the presence or absence of an internal body\ncavity called a coelom. The presence of a coelom affords\nmany advantages, and animals with a coelom may be termed\ntrue coelomates or pseudocoelomates, depending the extent\nto which mesoderm lines the body cavity. Coelomates are\nfurther divided into one of two groups called protostomes\nand deuterostomes, based on a number of developmental\ncharacteristics, including differences in zygote cleavage, the\nmethod of coelom formation, and the rigidity of the\ndevelopmental fate of blastomeres.\n27.3 Animal Phylogeny\nScientists are interested in the evolutionary history of\nanimals and the evolutionary relationships among them.\nThere are three main sources of data that scientists use to\ncreate phylogenetic evolutionary tree diagrams that illustrate\nsuch relationships: morphological information (which\nincludes developmental morphologies), fossil record data,\nand, most recently, molecular data. The details of the\nmodern phylogenetic tree change frequently as new data are\ngathered, and molecular data has recently contributed to\nmany substantial modifications of the understanding of\nrelationships between animal phyla.\n27.4 The Evolutionary History of the\nAnimal Kingdom\nThe most rapid documented diversification and evolution of\nanimal species in all of history occurred during the\nCambrian period of the Paleozoic Era, a phenomenon known\nas the Cambrian explosion. Until recently, scientists believed\nthat there were only very few tiny and simplistic animal\nspecies in existence before this period. However, recent fossil\ndiscoveries have revealed that additional, larger, and more\ncomplex animals existed during the Ediacaran period, and\neven possibly earlier, during the Cryogenian period. Still, the\nCambrian period undoubtedly witnessed the emergence of\nthe majority of animal phyla that we know today, although\nmany questions remain unresolved about this historical\nphenomenon.\nThe remainder of the Paleozoic Era is marked by the growing\nappearance of new classes, families, and species, and the\nearly colonization of land by certain marine animals and\nsemiaquatic arthropods, both freshwater and marine. The\nevolutionary history of animals is also marked by numerous\nmajor extinction events, each of which wiped out a majority\nof extant species. Some species of most animal phyla\nsurvived these extinctions, allowing the phyla to persist and\ncontinue to evolve into species that we see today.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

To most people,\nthese are the animals that attract our attention. Concentrating on vertebrates, however, gives us a rather\nbiased and limited view of animal diversity, because it ignores nearly 97 percent of the animal\nkingdom\u2014the invertebrates\u2014animals that lack a cranium and a defined vertebral column or spine.\nThe invertebrate animal phyla exhibit an enormous variety of cells and tissues adapted for specific\npurposes, and frequently these tissues are unique to their phyla. These specializations show the range of\ncellular differentiation possible within the clade Opisthokonta, which has both unicellular and\nmulticellular members. Cellular and structural specializations include cuticles for protection, spines and\ntiny harpoons for defense, toothy structures for feeding, and wings for flight. An exoskeleton may be\nadapted for movement or for the attachment of muscles as in the clams and insects. Secretory cells can\nproduce venom, mucus, or digestive enzymes. The body plans of some phyla, such as those of the\nmolluscs, annelids, arthropods, and echinoderms, have been modified and adapted throughout\nevolution to produce thousands of different forms. Perhaps you will find it amazing that an enormous\nnumber of both aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates\u2014perhaps millions of species\u2014have not yet been\nscientifically classified. As a result, the phylogenetic relationships among the invertebrates are\nconstantly being updated as new information is collected about the organisms of each phylum.\nChapter Outline\n28.1 Phylum Porifera\n28.2 Phylum Cnidaria\n28.3 Superphylum\nLophotrochozoa:\nFlatworms,\nRotifers, and\nNemerteans\n28.4 Superphylum\nLophotrochozoa:\nMolluscs and\nAnnelids\n28.5 Superphylum\nEcdysozoa:\nNematodes and\nTardigrades\n28.6 Superphylum\nEcdysozoa:\nArthropods\n28.7 Superphylum\nDeuterostomia\n28.1 Phylum Porifera\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the organizational features of the simplest multicellular organisms\n\u2022\nExplain the various body forms and bodily functions of sponges\nAs we have seen, the vast majority of invertebrate animals do not possess a defined bony vertebral\nendoskeleton, or a bony cranium. However, one of the most ancestral groups of deuterostome invertebrates,\nthe Echinodermata, do produce tiny skeletal \u201cbones\u201d called ossicles that make up a true endoskeleton, or\ninternal skeleton, covered by an epidermis.\nWe will start our investigation with the simplest of all the invertebrates\u2014animals sometimes classified\nwithin the clade Parazoa (\u201cbeside the animals\u201d). This clade currently includes only the phylum Placozoa\n(containing a single species, Trichoplax adhaerens), and the phylum Porifera, containing the more familiar\nsponges (Figure 28.2). The split between the Parazoa and the Eumetazoa (all animal clades above Parazoa)\nlikely took place over a billion years ago.\nWe should reiterate here that the Porifera do not possess \u201ctrue\u201d tissues that are embryologically homologous\nto those of all other derived animal groups such as the insects and mammals. This is because they do not\ncreate a true gastrula during embryogenesis, and as a result do not produce a true endoderm or ectoderm.\nBut even though they are not considered to have true tissues, they do have specialized cells that perform\nspecific functions like tissues (for example, the external \u201cpinacoderm\u201d of a sponge acts like our epidermis).\nThus, functionally, the poriferans can be said to have tissues; however, these tissues are likely not\nembryologically homologous to our own.\nSponge larvae (e.g, parenchymula and amphiblastula) are flagellated and able to swim; however, adults are\nnon-motile and spend their life attached to a substratum. Since water is vital to sponges for feeding,\nexcretion, and gas exchange, their body structure facilitates the movement of water through the sponge.\nVarious canals, chambers, and cavities enable water to move through the sponge to allow the exchange of\nfood and waste as well as the exchange of gases to nearly all body cells.\nFigure 28.2 Sponges. Sponges are members of the phylum Porifera, which contains the simplest invertebrates.\n(credit: Andrew Turner)\nMorphology of Sponges\nThere are at least 5,000 named species of sponges, likely with thousands more yet to be classified. The\nmorphology of the simplest sponges takes the shape of an irregular cylinder with a large central cavity, the\nspongocoel, occupying the inside of the cylinder (Figure 28.3). Water enters into the spongocoel through\nnumerous pores, or ostia, that create openings in the body wall. Water entering the spongocoel is expelled\nvia a large common opening called the osculum. However, we should note that sponges exhibit a range of\ndiversity in body forms, including variations in the size and shape of the spongocoel, as well as the number\n724\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nand arrangement of feeding chambers within the body wall. In some sponges, multiple feeding chambers open off of a central\nspongocoel and in others, several feeding chambers connecting to one another may lie between the entry pores and the\nspongocoel.\nWhile sponges do not exhibit true tissue-layer organization, they do have a number of functional \u201ctissues\u201d composed of different\ncell types specialized for distinct functions. For example, epithelial-like cells called pinacocytes form the outermost body, called\na pinacoderm, that serves a protective function similar that of our epidermis. Scattered among the pinacoderm are the ostia\nthat allow entry of water into the body of the sponge. These pores have given the sponges their phylum name Porifera\u2014pore-\nbearers. In some sponges, ostia are formed by porocytes, single tube-shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water\ninto the spongocoel. In other sponges, ostia are formed by folds in the body wall of the sponge. Between the outer layer and the\nfeeding chambers of the sponge is a jelly-like substance called the mesohyl, which contains collagenous fibers. Various cell types\nreside within the mesohyl, including amoebocytes, the \u201cstem cells\u201d of sponges, and sclerocytes, which produce skeletal\nmaterials. The gel-like consistency of mesohyl acts like an endoskeleton and maintains the tubular morphology of sponges.\nThe feeding chambers inside the sponge are lined by choanocytes (\"collar cells\"). The structure of a choanocyte is critical to its\nfunction, which is to generate a directed water current through the sponge and to trap and ingest microscopic food particles by\nphagocytosis. These feeding cells are similar in appearance to unicellular choanoflagellates (Protista). This similarity suggests\nthat sponges and choanoflagellates are closely related and likely share common ancestry. The body of the choanocyte is\nembedded in mesohyl and contains all the organelles required for normal cell function. Protruding into the \u201copen space\u201d inside\nthe feeding chamber is a mesh-like collar composed of microvilli with a single flagellum in the center of the column. The beating\nof the flagella from all choanocytes draws water into the sponge through the numerous ostia, into the spaces lined by\nchoanocytes, and eventually out through the osculum (or osculi, if the sponge consists of a colony of attached sponges). Food\nparticles, including waterborne bacteria and unicellular organisms such as algae and various animal-like protists, are trapped\nby the sieve-like collar of the choanocytes, slide down toward the body of the cell, and are ingested by phagocytosis. Choanocytes\nalso serve another surprising function: They can differentiate into sperm for sexual reproduction, at which time they become\ndislodged from the mesohyl and leave the sponge with expelled water through the osculum.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video to see the movement of water through the sponge body.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/filter_sponges)\nThe amoebocytes (derived from stem-cell-like archaeocytes), are so named because they move throughout the mesohyl in an\namoeba-like fashion. They have a variety of functions: In addition to delivering nutrients from choanocytes to other cells within\nthe sponge, they also give rise to eggs for sexual reproduction. (The eggs remain in the mesohyl, whereas the sperm cells are\nreleased into the water.) The amoebocytes can differentiate into other cell types of the sponge, such as collenocytes and\nlophocytes, which produce the collagen-like protein that support the mesohyl. Amoebocytes can also give rise to sclerocytes,\nwhich produce spicules (skeletal spikes of silica or calcium carbonate) in some sponges, and spongocytes, which produce the\nprotein spongin in the majority of sponges. These different cell types in sponges are shown in Figure 28.3.\n28.1 \u2022 Phylum Porifera\n725\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 28.3 Simple sponge body plan and cell types.

Spicules provide support for the body of the sponge, and may also deter predation. The\npresence and composition of spicules form the basis for differentiating three of the four classes of sponges (Figure 28.4).\nSponges in class Calcarea produce calcium carbonate spicules and no spongin; those in class Hexactinellida produce six-rayed\nsiliceous (glassy) spicules and no spongin; and those in class Demospongia contain spongin and may or may not have spicules; if\npresent, those spicules are siliceous. Sponges in this last class have been used as bath sponges. Spicules are most conspicuously\npresent in the glass sponges, class Hexactinellida. Some of the spicules may attain gigantic proportions. For example, relative to\ntypical glass sponge spicules, whose size generally ranges from 3 to 10 mm, some of the basal spicules of the hexactinellid\nMonorhaphis chuni are enormous and grow up to 3 meters long! The glass sponges are also unusual in that most of their body\ncells are fused together to form a multinucleate syncytium. Because their cells are interconnected in this way, the hexactinellid\nsponges have no mesohyl. A fourth class of sponges, the Sclerospongiae, was described from species discovered in underwater\ntunnels. These are also called coralline sponges after their multilayered calcium carbonate skeletons. Dating based on the rate of\ndeposition of the skeletal layers suggests that some of these sponges are hundreds of years old.\n726\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 28.4 Several classes of sponges.

Their food is trapped as water passes through the\nostia and out through the osculum. Bacteria smaller than 0.5 microns in size are trapped by choanocytes, which are the\nprincipal cells engaged in feeding, and are ingested by phagocytosis. However, particles that are larger than the ostia may be\nphagocytized at the sponge's surface by pinacocytes. In some sponges, amoebocytes transport food from cells that have ingested\nfood particles to those that do not. In sponges, in spite of what looks like a large digestive cavity, all digestion is intracellular.\nThe limit of this type of digestion is that food particles must be smaller than individual sponge cells.\nAll other major body functions in the sponge (gas exchange, circulation, excretion) are performed by diffusion between the cells\nthat line the openings within the sponge and the water that is passing through those openings. All cell types within the sponge\nobtain oxygen from water through diffusion. Likewise, carbon dioxide is released into seawater by diffusion. In addition,\nnitrogenous waste produced as a byproduct of protein metabolism is excreted via diffusion by individual cells into the water as it\npasses through the sponge.\nSome sponges host green algae or cyanobacteria as endosymbionts within archeocytes and other cells. It may be a surprise to\nlearn that there are nearly 150 species of carnivorous sponges, which feed primarily on tiny crustaceans, snaring them through\nsticky threads or hooked spicules!\nAlthough there is no specialized nervous system in sponges, there is intercellular communication that can regulate events like\ncontraction of the sponge's body or the activity of the choanocytes.\nReproduction\nSponges reproduce by sexual as well as asexual methods. The typical means of asexual reproduction is either fragmentation\n(during this process, a piece of the sponge breaks off, settles on a new substrate, and develops into a new individual), or budding\n(a genetically identical outgrowth grows from the parent and eventually detaches or remains attached to form a colony). An\natypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation of gemmules.\nGemmules are environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges (e.g., in the freshwater sponge Spongilla). In\ngemmules, an inner layer of archeocytes (amoebocytes) is surrounded by a pneumatic cellular layer that may be reinforced with\nspicules. In freshwater sponges, gemmules may survive hostile environmental conditions like changes in temperature, and then\nserve to recolonize the habitat once environmental conditions improve and stabilize. Gemmules are capable of attaching to a\nsubstratum and generating a new sponge. Since gemmules can withstand harsh environments, are resistant to desiccation, and\n28.1 \u2022 Phylum Porifera\n727\nremain dormant for long periods, they are an excellent means of colonization for a sessile organism.\nSexual reproduction in sponges occurs when gametes are generated. Oocytes arise by the differentiation of amoebocytes and are\nretained within the spongocoel, whereas spermatozoa result from the differentiation of choanocytes and are ejected via the\nosculum. Sponges are monoecious (hermaphroditic), which means that one individual can produce both gametes (eggs and\nsperm) simultaneously. In some sponges, production of gametes may occur throughout the year, whereas other sponges may\nshow sexual cycles depending upon water temperature. Sponges may also become sequentially hermaphroditic, producing\noocytes first and spermatozoa later. This temporal separation of gametes produced by the same sponge helps to encourage\ncross-fertilization and genetic diversity. Spermatozoa carried along by water currents can fertilize the oocytes borne in the\nmesohyl of other sponges. Early larval development occurs within the sponge, and free-swimming larvae (such as flagellated\nparenchymula) are then released via the osculum.\nLocomotion\nSponges are generally sessile as adults and spend their lives attached to a fixed substratum. They do not show movement over\nlarge distances like other free-swimming marine invertebrates. However, sponge cells are capable of creeping along substrata\nvia organizational plasticity, i.e., rearranging their cells. Under experimental conditions, researchers have shown that sponge\ncells spread on a physical support demonstrate a leading edge for directed movement. It has been speculated that this localized\ncreeping movement may help sponges adjust to microenvironments near the point of attachment. It must be noted, however,\nthat this pattern of movement has been documented in laboratories, it remains to be observed in natural sponge habitats.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this BBC video (http://openstax.org/l/sea_sponges) showing the array of sponges seen along the Cayman Wall during a\nsubmersible dive.\n28.2 Phylum Cnidaria\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nCompare structural and organization characteristics of Porifera and Cnidaria\n\u2022\nDescribe the progressive development of tissues and their relevance to animal complexity\n\u2022\nIdentify the two general body forms found in the Cnidaria\n\u2022\nDescribe the identifying features of the major cnidarian classes\nPhylum Cnidaria includes animals that exhibit radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic, meaning that they develop from\ntwo embryonic layers, ectoderm and endoderm. Nearly all (about 99 percent) cnidarians are marine species.\nWhereas the defining cell type for the sponges is the choanocyte, the defining cell type for the cnidarians is the cnidocyte, or\nstinging cell. These cells are located around the mouth and on the tentacles, and serve to capture prey or repel predators.\nCnidocytes have large stinging organelles called nematocysts, which usually contain barbs at the base of a long coiled thread.\nThe outer wall of the cell has a hairlike projection called a cnidocil, which is sensitive to tactile stimulation. If the cnidocils are\ntouched, the hollow threads evert with enormous acceleration, approaching 40,000 times that of gravity. The microscopic\nthreads then either entangle the prey or instantly penetrate the flesh of the prey or predator, releasing toxins (including\nneurotoxins and pore-forming toxins that can lead to cell lysis) into the target, thereby immobilizing it or paralyzing it (see\nFigure 28.5).\n728\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 28.5 Cnidocytes. Animals from the phylum Cnidaria have stinging cells called cnidocytes. Cnidocytes contain large organelles called\n(a) nematocysts that store a coiled thread and barb, the nematocyst.

(Figure 28.6).\nAn example of the polyp form is found in the genus Hydra, whereas the most typical form of medusa is found in the group called\nthe \u201csea jellies\u201d (jellyfish). Polyp forms are sessile as adults, with a single opening (the mouth/anus) to the digestive cavity facing\nup with tentacles surrounding it. Medusa forms are motile, with the mouth and tentacles hanging down from an umbrella-\nshaped bell.\nFigure 28.6 Cnidarian body forms. Cnidarians have two distinct body plans, the medusa (a) and the polyp (b). All cnidarians have two\nmembrane layers, with a jelly-like mesoglea between them.\nSome cnidarians are dimorphic, that is, they exhibit both body plans during their life cycle. In these species, the polyp serves as\nthe asexual phase, while the medusa serves as the sexual stage and produces gametes. However, both body forms are diploid.\nAn example of cnidarian dimorphism can be seen in the colonial hydroid Obelia. The sessile asexual colony has two types of\npolyps, shown in Figure 28.7. The first is the gastrozooid, which is adapted for capturing prey and feeding. In Obelia, all polyps\nare connected through a common digestive cavity called a coenosarc. The other type of polyp is the gonozooid, adapted for the\nasexual budding and the production of sexual medusae. The reproductive buds from the gonozooid break off and mature into\nfree-swimming medusae, which are either male or female (dioecious). Each medusa has either several testes or several ovaries\nin which meiosis occurs to produce sperm or egg cells. Interestingly, the gamete-producing cells do not arise within the gonad\n28.2 \u2022 Phylum Cnidaria\n729\nitself, but migrate into it from the tissues in the gonozooid. This separate origin of gonad and gametes is common throughout\nthe eumetazoa. The gametes are released into the surrounding water, and after fertilization, the zygote develops into a blastula,\nwhich soon develops into a ciliated, bilaterally symmetrical planula larva. The planula swims freely for a while, but eventually\nattaches to a substrate and becomes a single polyp, from which a new colony of polyps is formed by budding.\nFigure 28.7 Obelia. The colonial sessile form of Obelia geniculata has two types of polyps: gastrozooids, which are adapted for capturing\nprey, and gonozooids, which asexually bud to produce medusae.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick here to follow an Obelia life cycle (http://openstax.org/l/obelia) animation.\nAll cnidarians are diploblastic and thus have two \u201cepithelial\u201d layers in the body that are derived from the endoderm and\nectoderm of the embryo. The outer layer (from ectoderm) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal, whereas the\ninner layer (from endoderm) is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity. In the planula larva, a layer of ectoderm\nsurrounds a solid mass of endoderm, but as the polyp develops, the digestive or gastrovascular cavity opens within the\nendoderm. A non-living, jelly-like mesoglea lies between these two epithelial layers. In terms of cellular complexity, cnidarians\nshow the presence of differentiated cell types in each tissue layer, such as nerve cells, contractile epithelial cells, enzyme-\nsecreting cells, and nutrient-absorbing cells, as well as the presence of intercellular connections. However, with a few notable\nexceptions such as statocysts and rhopalia (see below), the development of organs or organ systems is not advanced in this\nphylum.\nThe nervous system is rudimentary, with nerve cells organized in a network scattered across the body. This nerve net may show\nthe presence of groups of cells that form nerve plexi (singular: plexus) or nerve cords. Organization of the nervous system in the\nmotile medusa is more complex than that of the sessile polyp, with a nerve ring around the edge of the medusa bell that controls\nthe action of the tentacles. Cnidarian nerve cells show mixed characteristics of motor and sensory neurons. The predominant\nsignaling molecules in these primitive nervous systems are peptides, which perform both excitatory and inhibitory functions.\n730\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nDespite the simplicity of the nervous system, it is remarkable that it coordinates the complicated movement of the tentacles, the\ndrawing of captured prey to the mouth, the digestion of food, and the expulsion of waste.\nThe gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus; this arrangement is called an\nincomplete digestive system. In the gastrovascular cavity, extracellular digestion occurs as food is taken into the gastrovascular\ncavity, enzymes are secreted into the cavity, and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients. However, some intracellular\ndigestion also occurs. The gastrovascular cavity distributes nutrients throughout the body of the animal, with nutrients passing\nfrom the digestive cavity across the mesoglea to the epidermal cells. Thus, this cavity serves both digestive and circulatory\nfunctions.\nCnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis and water in the environment,\nand between cells in the gastrodermis and water in the gastrovascular cavity. The lack of a circulatory system to move dissolved\ngases limits the thickness of the body wall and necessitates a non-living mesoglea between the layers. In the cnidarians with a\nthicker mesoglea, a number of canals help to distribute both nutrients and gases. There is neither an excretory system nor\norgans, and nitrogenous wastes simply diffuse from the cells into the water outside the animal or into the gastrovascular cavity.\nThe phylum Cnidaria contains about 10,000 described species divided into two monophyletic clades: the Anthozoa and the\nMedusozoa. The Anthozoa include the corals, sea fans, sea whips, and the sea anemones. The Medusozoa include several classes\nof Cnidaria in two clades: The Hydrozoa include sessile forms, some medusoid forms, and swimming colonial forms like the\nPortuguese man-of-war. The other clade contains various types of jellies including both Scyphozoa and Cubozoa. The Anthozoa\ncontain only sessile polyp forms, while the Medusozoa include species with both polyp and medusa forms in their life cycle.\nClass Anthozoa\nThe class Anthozoa (\"flower animals\") includes sea anemones (Figure 28.8), sea pens, and corals, with an estimated number of\n6,100 described species. Sea anemones are usually brightly colored and can attain a size of 1.8 to 10 cm in diameter. Individual\nanimals are cylindrical in shape and are attached directly to a substrate.\nFigure 28.8 Sea anemone. The sea anemone is shown (a) photographed and (b) in a diagram illustrating its morphology.

The slit-like mouth opening and flattened pharynx\nare lined with ectoderm. This structure of the pharynx makes anemones bilaterally symmetrical. A ciliated groove called a\nsiphonoglyph is found on two opposite sides of the pharynx and directs water into it. The pharynx is the muscular part of the\ndigestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food, and may extend for up to two-thirds the length of the body before\nopening into the gastrovascular cavity. This cavity is divided into several chambers by longitudinal septa called mesenteries.\nEach mesentery consists of a fold of gastrodermal tissue with a layer of mesoglea between the sheets of gastrodermis.\nMesenteries do not divide the gastrovascular cavity completely, and the smaller cavities coalesce at the pharyngeal opening. The\nadaptive benefit of the mesenteries appears to be an increase in surface area for absorption of nutrients and gas exchange, as\nwell as additional mechanical support for the body of the anemone.\nSea anemones feed on small fish and shrimp, usually by immobilizing their prey with nematocysts. Some sea anemones\nestablish a mutualistic relationship with hermit crabs when the crab seizes and attaches them to their shell. In this relationship,\nthe anemone gets food particles from prey caught by the crab, and the crab is protected from the predators by the stinging cells\nof the anemone. Some species of anemone fish, or clownfish, are also able to live with sea anemones because they build up an\nacquired immunity to the toxins contained within the nematocysts and also secrete a protective mucus that prevents them from\nbeing stung.\nThe structure of coral polyps is similar to that of anemones, although the individual polyps are usually smaller and part of a\ncolony, some of which are massive and the size of small buildings. Coral polyps feed on smaller planktonic organisms, including\nalgae, bacteria, and invertebrate larvae. Some anthozoans have symbiotic associations with dinoflagellate algae called\nzooxanthellae. The mutually beneficial relationship between zooxanthellae and modern corals\u2014which provides the algae with\nshelter\u2014gives coral reefs their colors and supplies both organisms with nutrients. This complex mutualistic association began\nmore than 210 million years ago, according to a new study by an international team of scientists. That this symbiotic\nrelationship arose during a time of massive worldwide coral-reef expansion suggests that the interconnection of algae and coral\nis crucial for the health of coral reefs, which provide habitat for roughly one-fourth of all marine life. Reefs are threatened by a\ntrend in ocean warming that has caused corals to expel their zooxanthellae algae and turn white, a process called coral\nbleaching.\nAnthozoans remain polypoid (note that this term is easily confused with \"polyploid\") throughout their lives and can reproduce\nasexually by budding or fragmentation, or sexually by producing gametes. Male or female gametes produced by a polyp fuse to\ngive rise to a free-swimming planula larva. The larva settles on a suitable substratum and develops into a sessile polyp.\nClass Scyphozoa\nClass Scyphozoa (\"cup animals\") includes all (and only) the marine jellies, with about 200 known species. The medusa is the\nprominent stage in the life cycle, although there is a polyp stage in the life cycle of most species. Most jellies range from 2 to 40\ncm in length but the largest scyphozoan species, Cyanea capillata, can reach a size of two meters in diameter. Scyphozoans\ndisplay a characteristic bell-like morphology (Figure 28.9).\nFigure 28.9 A sea jelly. A jelly is shown (a) photographed and (b) in a diagram illustrating its morphology.

Scyphozoans live most of their life cycle as free-swimming, solitary carnivores. The mouth leads to the\ngastrovascular cavity, which may be sectioned into four interconnected sacs, called diverticuli. In some species, the digestive\nsystem may branch further into radial canals. Like the septa in anthozoans, the branched gastrovascular cells serve two\nfunctions: to increase the surface area for nutrient absorption and diffusion, and to support the body of the animal.\nIn scyphozoans, nerve cells are organized in a nerve net that extends over the entire body, with a nerve ring around the edge of\nthe bell. Clusters of sensory organs called rhopalia may be present in pockets in the edge of the bell. Jellies have a ring of muscles\nlining the dome of the body, which provides the contractile force required to swim through water, as well as to draw in food from\nthe water as they swim. Scyphozoans have separate sexes. The gonads are formed from the gastrodermis and gametes are\nexpelled through the mouth. Planula larvae are formed by external fertilization; they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form.\nThese polyps may bud to form additional polyps or begin immediately to produce medusa buds. In a few species, the planula\nlarva may develop directly into the medusa. The life cycle (Figure 28.10) of most scyphozoans includes both sexual medusoid and\nasexual polypoid body forms.\nFigure 28.10 Scyphozoan life cycle. The lifecycle of most jellyfish includes two stages: the medusa stage and the polyp stage. The polyp\nreproduces asexually by budding, and the medusa reproduces sexually. (credit \"medusa\": modification of work by Francesco Crippa)\nClass Cubozoa\nThis class includes jellies that have a box-shaped medusa, or a bell that is square in cross-section, and are colloquially known as\n\u201cbox jellyfish.\u201d These species may achieve sizes of 15 to 25 cm, but typically members of the Cubozoa are not as large as those of\nthe Scyphozoa. However, cubozoans display overall morphological and anatomical characteristics that are similar to those of the\nscyphozoans. A prominent difference between the two classes is the arrangement of tentacles. The cubozoans contain muscular\npads called pedalia at the corners of the square bell canopy, with one or more tentacles attached to each pedalium. In some\ncases, the digestive system may extend into the pedalia. Nematocysts may be arranged in a spiral configuration along the\ntentacles; this arrangement helps to effectively subdue and capture prey. Cubozoans include the most venomous of all the\ncnidarians (Figure 28.11).\n28.2 \u2022 Phylum Cnidaria\n733\nThese animals are unusual in having image-forming eyes, including a cornea, lens, and retina. Because these structures are\nmade from a number of interactive tissues, they can be called true organs. Eyes are located in four clusters between each pair of\npedalia. Each cluster consists of four simple eye spots plus two image-forming eyes oriented in different directions. How\nimages formed by these very complex eyes are processed remains a mystery, since cubozoans have extensive nerve nets but no\ndistinct brain. Nontheless, the presence of eyes helps the cubozoans to be active and effective hunters of small marine animals\nlike worms, arthropods, and fish.\nCubozoans have separate sexes and fertilization occurs inside the female. Planula larvae may develop inside the female or be\nreleased, depending on species. Each planula develops into a polyp. These polyps may bud to form more polyps to create a\ncolony; each polyp then transforms into a single medusa.\nFigure 28.11 A cubozoan. The (a) tiny cubozoan jelly Malo kingi is thimble-shaped and, like all cubozoan jellies, (b) has four muscular\npedalia to which the tentacles attach. M. kingi is one of two species of jellies known to cause Irukandji syndrome, a condition characterized\nby excruciating muscle pain, vomiting, increased heart rate, and psychological symptoms. Two people in Australia, where Irukandji jellies\nare most commonly found, are believed to have died from Irukandji stings. (c) A sign on a beach in northern Australia warns swimmers of\nthe danger. (credit c: modification of work by Peter Shanks)\nClass Hydrozoa\nHydrozoa is a diverse group that includes nearly 3,200 species; most are marine, although some freshwater species are known\n(Figure 28.12). Most species exhibit both polypoid and medusoid forms in their lifecycles, although the familiar Hydra has only\nthe polyp form. The medusoid form has a muscular veil or velum below the margin of the bell and for this reason is called a\nhydromedusa. In contrast, the medusoid form of Scyphozoa lacks a velum and is termed a scyphomedusa.\nThe polyp form in these animals often shows a cylindrical morphology with a central gastrovascular cavity lined by the\ngastrodermis. The gastrodermis and epidermis have a simple layer of mesoglea sandwiched between them. A mouth opening,\nsurrounded by tentacles, is present at the oral end of the animal. Many hydrozoans form sessile, branched colonies of\nspecialized polyps that share a common, branching gastrovascular cavity (coenosarc), such as is found in the colonial hydroid\nObelia.\nFree-floating colonial species called siphonophores contain both medusoid and polypoid individuals that are specialized for\nfeeding, defense, or reproduction. The distinctive rainbow-hued float of the Portuguese man o\u2019 war (Physalia physalis) creates a\npneumatophore with which it regulates buoyancy by filling and expelling carbon monoxide gas. At first glance, these complex\nsuperorganisms appear to be a single organism; but the reality is that even the tentacles are actually composed of zooids laden\nwith nematocysts. Thus, although it superficially resembles a typical medusozoan jellyfish, P. physalis is a free-floating\nhydrozoan colony; each specimen is made up of many hundreds of organisms, each specialized for a certain function, including\nmotility and buoyancy, feeding, reproduction and defense. Although they are carnivorous and feed on many soft bodied marine\nanimals, P. physalis lack stomachs and instead have specialized polyps called gastrozooids that they use to digest their prey in\nthe open water.\nPhysalia has male and female colonies, which release their gametes into the water. The zygote develops into a single individual,\nwhich then buds asexually to form a new colony. Siphonophores include the largest known floating cnidarian colonies such as\n734\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nPraya dubia, whose chain of zoids can get up to 50 meters (165 feet) long. Other hydrozoan species are solitary polyps (Hydra) or\nsolitary hydromedusae (Gonionemus). One defining characteristic shared by the hydrozoans is that their gonads are derived\nfrom epidermal tissue, whereas in all other cnidarians they are derived from gastrodermal tissue.\nFigure 28.12 Hydrozoans. The polyp colony Obelia (a), siphonophore colonies Physalia (b) physalis, known as the Portuguese man o\u2018 war\nand Velella bae (c), and the solitary polyp Hydra (d) have different body shapes but all belong to the family Hydrozoa.

These phyla are also bilaterally\n28.3 \u2022 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Flatworms, Rotifers, and Nemerteans\n735\nsymmetrical, meaning that a longitudinal section will divide them into right and left sides that are superficially symmetrical. In\nthese phyla, we also see the beginning of cephalization, the evolution of a concentration of nervous tissues and sensory organs\nin the head of the organism\u2014exactly where a mobile bilaterally symmetrical organism first encounters its environment.\nLophotrochozoa are also protostomes, in which the blastopore, or the point of invagination of the ectoderm (outer germ layer),\nbecomes the mouth opening into the alimentary canal. This developmental pattern is called protostomy or \u201cfirst mouth.\u201d\nProtostomes include acoelomate, pseudocoelomate, and eucoelomate phyla. The coelom is a cavity that separates the ectoderm\nfrom the endoderm. In acoelomates, a solid mass of mesoderm is sandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm and does\nnot form a cavity or \u201ccoelom,\u201d leaving little room for organ development; in pseudocoelomates, there is a cavity or pseudocoelom\nthat replaces the blastocoel (the cavity within the blastula), but it is only lined by mesoderm on the outside of the cavity, leaving\nthe gut tube and organs unlined; in eucoelomates, the cavity that obliterates the blastocoel as the coelom develops is lined both\non the outside of the cavity (parietal layer) and also on the inside of the cavity, around the gut tube and the internal organs\n(visceral layer).\nEucoelmate protostomes are schizocoels, in which mesoderm-producing cells typically migrate into the blastocoel during\ngastrulation and multiply to form a solid mass of cells. Cavities then develop within the cell mass to form the coelom. Since the\nforming body cavity splits the mesoderm, this protostomic coelom is termed a schizocoelom. As we will see later in this chapter,\nchordates, the phylum to which we belong, generally develop a coelom by enterocoely: pouches of mesoderm pinch off the\ninvaginating primitive gut, or archenteron, and then fuse to form a complete coelom. We should note here that a eucoelomate\ncan form its \u201ctrue coelom\u201d by either schizocoely or enterocoely. The process that produces the coelom is different and of\ntaxonomic importance, but the result is the same: a complete, mesodermally lined coelom.\nMost organisms placed in the superphylum Lophotrochozoa possess either a lophophore feeding apparatus or a trochophore\nlarvae (thus the contracted name, \u201clopho-trocho-zoa\u201d). The lophophore is a feeding structure composed of a set of ciliated\ntentacles surrounding the mouth. A trochophore is a free-swimming larva characterized by two bands of cilia surrounding a\ntop-like body. Some of the phyla classified as Lophotrochozoa may be missing one or both of these defining structures.\nNevertheless their placement with the Lophotrochozoa is upheld when ribosomal RNA and other gene sequences are compared.\nThe systematics of this complex group is still unclear and much more work remains to resolve the cladistic relationships among\nthem.\nPhylum Platyhelminthes\nThe flatworms are acoelomate organisms that include many free-living and parasitic forms. The flatworms possess neither a\nlophophore nor trochophore larvae, although the larvae of one group of flatworms, the Polycladida (named after its many-\nbranched digestive tract), are considered to be homologous to trochophore larvae. Spiral cleavage is also seen in the polycladids\nand other basal flatworm groups. The developmental pattern of some of the free-living forms is obscured by a phenomenon\ncalled \"blastomere anarchy,\" in which a sort of temporary feeding larva forms, followed by a regrouping of cells within the\nembryo that gives rise to a second-stage embryo. However, both the monophyly of the flatworms and their placement in the\nLophotrochozoa has been supported by molecular analyses.\nThe Platyhelminthes consist of two monophyletic lineages: the Catenulida and the Rhabditophora. The Catenulida, or \"chain\nworms,\" is a small clade of just over 100 species. These worms typically reproduce asexually by budding. However, the offspring\ndo not fully detach from the parents and the formation resembles a chain in appearance. All of the flatworms discussed here are\npart of the Rhabditophora (\"rhabdite bearers\"). Rhabdites are rodlike structures discharged in the mucus produced by some\nfree-living flatworms; Eucoelmate protostomes are schizocoels, in which mesoderm-producing cells typically migrate into the\nblastocoel during gastrulation likely serve in both defense and to provide traction for ciliary gliding along the substrate. Unlike\nfree-living flatworms, many species of trematodes and cestodes are parasitic, including important parasites of humans.\n736\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 28.13 Flatworms exhibit significant diversity. (a) A blue Pseudoceros flatworm (Pseudoceros bifurcus); (b) gold speckled flatworm\n(Thysanozoon nigropapillosum). (credit a: modification of work by Stephen Childs; b: modification of work by Pril Fish.)\nFlatworms have three embryonic tissue layers that give rise to epidermal tissues (from ectoderm), the lining of the digestive\nsystem (from endoderm), and other internal tissues (from mesoderm). The epidermal tissue is a single layer of cells or a layer of\nfused cells (syncytium) that covers two layers of muscle, one circular and the other longitudinal. The mesodermal tissues include\nmesenchymal cells that contain collagen and support secretory cells that produce mucus and other materials at the surface.\nBecause flatworms are acoelomates, the mesodermal layer forms a solid mass between the outer epidermal surface and the\ncavity of the digestive system.\nPhysiological Processes of Flatworms\nThe free-living species of flatworms are predators or scavengers. Parasitic forms feed by absorbing nutrients provided by their\nhosts. Most flatworms, such as the planarian shown in Figure 28.14, have a branching gastrovascular cavity rather than a\ncomplete digestive system. In such animals, the \u201cmouth\u201d is also used to expel waste materials from the digestive system, and\nthus also serves as an anus. (A few species may have a second anal pore or opening.) The gut may be a simple sac or highly\nbranched. Digestion is primarily extracellular, with digested materials taken into the cells of the gut lining by phagocytosis. One\nparasitic group, the tapeworms (cestodes), lacks a digestive system altogether, and absorb digested food from the host.\nFlatworms have an excretory system with a network of tubules attached to flame cells, whose cilia beat to direct waste fluids\nconcentrated in the tubules out of the body through excretory pores. The system is responsible for the regulation of dissolved\nsalts and the excretion of nitrogenous wastes. The nervous system consists of a pair of lateral nerve cords running the length of\nthe body with transverse connections between them. Two large cerebral ganglia\u2014concentrations of nerve cell bodies at the\nanterior end of the worm\u2014are associated with photosensory and chemosensory cells. There is neither a circulatory nor a\nrespiratory system, with gas and nutrient exchange dependent on diffusion and cell-to-cell junctions. This necessarily limits the\nthickness of the body in these organisms, constraining them to be \u201cflat\u201d worms. Most flatworm species are monoecious (both\nmale and female reproductive organs are found in the same individual), and fertilization is typically internal. Asexual\nreproduction by fission is common in some groups.\n28.3 \u2022 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Flatworms, Rotifers, and Nemerteans\n737\nFigure 28.14 Planaria, a free-living flatworm. The planarian is a flatworm that has a gastrovascular cavity with one opening that serves as\nboth mouth and anus. The excretory system is made up of flame cells and tubules connected to excretory pores on both sides of the body.\nThe nervous system is composed of two interconnected nerve cords running the length of the body, with cerebral ganglia and eyespots at\nthe anterior end.\nDiversity of Flatworms\nThe flatworms have been traditionally divided into four classes: Turbellaria, Monogenea, Trematoda, and Cestoda (Figure 28.15).\nHowever, the relationships among members of these classes has recently been reassessed, with the turbellarians in particular\nnow viewed as paraphyletic, since its descendants may also include members of the other three classes. Members of the clade or\nclass Rhabditophora are now dispersed among multiple orders of Platyhelminthes, the most familiar of these being the\nPolycladida, which contains the large marine flatworms; the Tricladida (which includes Dugesia [\u201cplanaria\u201d] and Planaria and its\nrelatives); and the major parasitic orders: Monogenea (fish ectoparasites), Trematoda (flukes), and Cestoda (tapeworms), which\ntogether form a monophyletic clade.\n738\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 28.15 Traditional flatworm classes. Phylum Platyhelminthes was previously divided into four classes. (a) Class Turbellaria includes\nthe free-living polycladid Bedford\u2019s flatworm (Pseudobiceros bedfordi), which is about 8 to 10 cm in length. (b) The parasitic class\nMonogenea includes Dactylogyrus spp, commonly called gill flukes, which are about 0.2 mm in length and have two anchors, indicated by\narrows used to attach the parasite on to the gills of host fish. (c) The class Trematoda includes Fascioloides magna (right) and Fasciola\nhepatica (two specimens on left, also known as the common liver fluke). (d) Class Cestoda includes tapeworms such as this Taenia\nsaginata, infects both cattle and humans, and can reach 4 to 10 meters in length; the specimen shown here is about four meters long.\n(credit a: modification of work by Jan Derk; credit d: modification of work by CDC)\nMost free-living flatworms are marine polycladids, although tricladid species live in freshwater or moist terrestrial\nenvironments, and there are a number of members from other orders in both environments. The ventral epidermis of free-living\nflatworms is ciliated, which facilitates their locomotion. Some free-living flatworms are capable of remarkable feats of\nregeneration in which an individual may regrow its head or tail after being severed, or even several heads if the planaria is cut\nlengthwise.\nThe monogeneans are ectoparasites, mostly of fish, with simple life cycles that consist of a free-swimming larva that attaches to\na fish, prior to its transformation to the ectoparasitic adult form. The parasite has only one host and that host is usually very\nspecific. The worms may produce enzymes that digest the host tissues, or they may simply graze on surface mucus and skin\nparticles. Most monogeneans are hermaphroditic, but the male gametes develop first and so cross-fertilization is quite\ncommon.\nThe trematodes, or flukes, are internal parasites of mollusks and many other groups, including humans. Trematodes have\ncomplex life cycles that involve a primary host in which sexual reproduction occurs, and one or more secondary hosts in which\nasexual reproduction occurs. The primary host is usually a vertebrate and the secondary host is almost always a mollusk, in\nwhich multiple larvae are produced asexually. Trematodes, which attached internally to the host via an oral and medial sucker,\nare responsible for serious human diseases including schistosomiasis, caused by several species of the blood fluke, Schistosoma\n28.3 \u2022 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Flatworms, Rotifers, and Nemerteans\n739\nspp. Various forms of schistosomiasis infect an estimated 200 million people in the tropics, leading to organ damage, secondary\ninfection by bacteria, and chronic symptoms like fatigue. Infection occurs when the human enters the water and metacercaria\nlarvae, released from the snail host, locate and penetrate the skin. The parasite infects various organs in the body and feeds on\nred blood cells before reproducing.\nMany of the eggs are released in feces and find their way into a waterway, where they are able to reinfect the snail host. The eggs,\nwhich have a barb on them, can damage the vascular system of the human host, causing ulceration, abscesses, and bloody\ndiarrhea, wherever they reside, thereby allowing other pathogens to cause secondary infections. In fact, it is the parasite\u2019s eggs\nthat produce most of the main ill effects of schistosomiasis. Many eggs do not make the transit through the veins of the host for\nelimination, and are swept by blood flow back to the liver and other locations, where they can cause severe inflammation. In the\nliver, the errant eggs may impede circulation and cause cirrhosis. Control is difficult in impoverished areas in unsanitary,\ncrowded conditions, and prognosis is poor in people with heavy infections of Schistosoma japonicum, without early treatment.\nThe cestodes, or tapeworms, are also internal parasites, mainly of vertebrates (Figure 28.16). Tapeworms, such as those of Taenia\nspp, live in the intestinal tract of the primary host and remain fixed using a sucker or hooks on the anterior end, or scolex, of the\ntapeworm body, which is essentially a colony of similar subunits called proglottids. Each proglottid may contain an excretory\nsystem with flame cells, along with reproductive structures, both male and female. Because they are so long and flat, tapeworms\ndo not need a digestive system; instead, they absorb nutrients from the food matter surrounding them in the host\u2019s intestine by\ndiffusion.\nProglottids are produced at the scolex and gradually migrate to the end of the tapeworm; at this point, they are \u201cmature\u201d and all\nstructures except fertilized eggs have degenerated. Most reproduction occurs by cross-fertilization between different worms in\nthe same host, but may also occur between proglottids. The mature proglottids detach from the body of the worm and are\nreleased into the feces of the organism. The eggs are eaten by an intermediate host, typically another vertebrate. The juvenile\nworm infects the intermediate host and takes up residence, usually in muscle tissue. When the muscle tissue is consumed by the\nprimary host, the cycle is completed. There are several tapeworm parasites of humans that are transmitted by eating uncooked\nor poorly cooked pork, beef, or fish.\n740\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 28.16 Tapeworm life cycle. Tapeworm (Taenia spp.) infections occur when humans consume raw or undercooked infected meat.\n(credit: modification of work by CDC)\nPhylum Rotifera\nThe rotifers (\"wheel-bearer\") belong to a group of microscopic (about 100 \u00b5m to 2 mm) mostly aquatic animals that get their\nname from the corona\u2014a pair of ciliated feeding structures that appear to rotate when viewed under the light microscope\n(Figure 28.17). Although their taxonomic status is currently in flux, one treatment places the rotifers in three classes: Bdelloidea,\nMonogononta, and Seisonidea. In addition, the parasitic \u201cspiny headed worms\u201d currently in phylum Acanthocephala, appear to\nbe modified rotifers and will probably be placed into the group in the near future. Undoubtedly the rotifers will continue to be\nrevised as more phylogenetic evidence becomes available.\nThe pseudocoelomate body of a rotifer is remarkably complex for such a small animal (roughly the size of a Paramecium) and is\ndivided into three sections: a head (which contains the corona), a trunk (which contains most of the internal organs), and the\nfoot. A cuticle, rigid in some species and flexible in others, covers the body surface. They have both skeletal muscle associated\nwith locomotion and visceral muscles associated with the gut, both composed of single cells. Rotifers are typically free-\nswimming or planktonic (drifting) organisms, but the toes or extensions of the foot can secrete a sticky material to help them\nadhere to surfaces. The head contains a number of eyespots and a bilobed \u201cbrain,\u201d with nerves extending into the body.\n28.3 \u2022 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Flatworms, Rotifers, and Nemerteans\n741\nFigure 28.17 Rotifers. Shown are examples from two of the three classes of rotifer. (a) Species from the class Bdelloidea are characterized\nby a large corona. The whole animals in the center of this scanning electron micrograph are shown surrounded by several sets of jaws from\nthe mastax of rotifers. (b) Polyarthra, from the largest rotifer class Monogononta, has a smaller corona than bdelloid rotifers, and a single\ngonad, which give the class its name. (credit a: modification of work by Diego Fontaneto; credit b: modification of work by U.S. EPA; scale-\nbar data from Cory Zanker)\nRotifers are commonly found in freshwater and some saltwater environments throughout the world. As filter feeders, they will\neat dead material, algae, and other microscopic living organisms, and are therefore very important components of aquatic food\nwebs. A rotifer's food is directed toward the mouth by the current created from the movement of the coronal cilia. The food\nparticles enter the mouth and travel first to the mastax\u2014a muscular pharynx with toothy jaw-like structures. Examples of the\njaws of various rotifers are seen in Figure 28.17a. Masticated food passes near digestive and salivary glands, into the stomach,\nand then to the intestines. Digestive and excretory wastes are collected in a cloacal bladder before being released out the anus.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/rotifers) to see rotifers feeding.\nAbout 2,200 species of rotifers have been identified. Figure 28.18 shows the anatomy of a rotifer belonging to class Bdelloidea.\nSome rotifers are dioecious organisms and exhibit sexual dimorphism (males and females have different forms). In many\ndioecious species, males are short-lived and smaller with no digestive system and a single testis. Many rotifer species exhibit\nhaplodiploidy, a method of sex determination in which a fertilized egg develops into a female and an unfertilized egg develops\ninto a male. However, reproduction in the bdelloid rotifers is exclusively parthenogenetic and appears to have been so for\nmillions of years: Thus, all bdelloid rotifers and their progeny are female! The bdelloids may compensate for this genetic\ninsularity by borrowing genes from the DNA of other species. Up to 10% of a bdelloid genome comprises genes imported from\nrelated species. Some rotifer eggs are capable of extended dormancy for protection during harsh environmental conditions.\n742\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 28.18 A bdelloid rotifer. This illustration shows the anatomy of a bdelloid rotifer.\nPhylum Nemertea\nThe Nemertea are colloquially known as ribbon worms or proboscis worms. Most species of phylum Nemertea are marine and\npredominantly benthic (bottom dwellers), with an estimated 900 known species. However, nemerteans have been recorded in\nfreshwater and very damp terrestrial habitats as well. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on worms, clams, and\ncrustaceans. Some species are scavengers, and some, like Malacobdella grossa, have also evolved commensal relationships with\nmollusks. Economically important species have at times devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. Nemerteans have\nalmost no predators and two species are sold as fish bait.\nMorphology\nNemerteans vary in size from 1 cm to several meters. They show bilateral symmetry and remarkable contractile properties.\nBecause of their contractility, they can change their morphological presentation in response to environmental cues. Animals in\nphylum Nemertea are soft and unsegmented animals, with a morphology like a flattened tube. (Figure 28.19).\n28.3 \u2022 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Flatworms, Rotifers, and Nemerteans\n743\nFigure 28.19 A proboscis worm. The proboscis worm (Parborlasia corrugatus) is a scavenger that combs the sea floor for food. The species\nis a member of the phylum Nemertea. The specimen shown here was photographed in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. (credit: Henry Kaiser,\nNational Science Foundation)\nA unique characteristic of this phylum is the presence of an eversible proboscis enclosed in a pocket called a rhynchocoel (not\npart of the animal's actual coelom). The proboscis is located dorsal to the gut and serves as a harpoon or tentacle for food\ncapture. In some species it is ornamented with barbs. The rhynchocoel is a fluid-filled cavity that extends from the head to\nnearly two-thirds of the length of the gut in these animals (Figure 28.20). The proboscis may be extended by hydrostatic pressure\ngenerated by contraction of muscle of the rhynchocoel and retracted by a retractor muscle attached to the rear wall of the\nrhynchocoel.\nFigure 28.20 The anatomy of a Nemertean is shown.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video (https://www.openstax.org/l/nemertean) to see a nemertean attack a polychaete with its proboscis.\nDigestive System\nThe nemerteans, which are primarily predators of annelids and crustaceans, have a well-developed digestive system. A mouth\nopening that is ventral to the rhynchocoel leads into the foregut, followed by the intestine. The intestine is present in the form of\ndiverticular pouches and ends in a rectum that opens via an anus. Gonads are interspersed with the intestinal diverticular\npouches and open outward via genital pores.\nNemerteans are sometimes classified as acoels, but because their closed circulatory system is derived from the coelomic cavity\nof the embryo, they may be regarded as coelomic. Their circulatory system consists of a closed loop formed by a connected pair\nof lateral blood vessels. Some species may also have a dorsal vessel or cross-connecting vessels in addition to lateral ones.\nAlthough the circulatory fluid contains cells, it is often colorless. However, the blood cells of some species bear hemoglobin as\nwell as other yellow or green pigments. The blood vessels are contractile, although there is usually no regular circulatory\npathway, and movement of blood is also facilitated by the contraction of muscles in the body wall. The circulation of fluids in the\nrhychocoel is more or less independent of the blood circulation, although blind branches from the blood vessels into the\nrhyncocoel wall can mediate exchange of materials between them. A pair of protonephridia, or excretory tubules, is present in\n744\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthese animals to facilitate osmoregulation. Gaseous exchange occurs through the skin.\nNervous System\nNemerteans have a \"brain\" composed of four ganglia situated at the anterior end, around the rhynchocoel. Paired longitudinal\nnerve cords emerge from the brain ganglia and extend to the posterior end. Additional nerve cords are found in some species.\nInterestingly, the brain can contain hemoglobin, which acts as an oxygen reserve. Ocelli or eyespots are present in pairs, in\nmultiples of two in the anterior portion of the body. It is speculated that the eyespots originate from neural tissue and not from\nthe epidermis.\nReproduction\nNemerteans, like flatworms, have excellent powers of regeneration, and asexual reproduction by fragmentation is seen in some\nspecies. Most animals in phylum Nemertea are dioecious, although freshwater species may be hermaphroditic. Stem cells that\nbecome gametes aggregate within gonads placed along the digestive tract. Eggs and sperm are released into the water, and\nfertilization occurs externally. Like most lophotrochozoan protostomes, cleavage is spiral, and development is usually direct,\nalthough some species have a trochophore-like larva, in which a young worm is constructed from a series of imaginal discs that\nbegin as invaginations from the body surface of the larva.\n28.4 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Molluscs and Annelids\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the unique anatomical and morphological features of molluscs and annelids\n\u2022\nDescribe the formation of the coelom\n\u2022\nIdentify an important extracoelomic cavity in molluscs\n\u2022\nDescribe the major body regions of Mollusca and how they vary in different molluscan classes\n\u2022\nDiscuss the advantages of true body segmentation\n\u2022\nDescribe the features of animals classified in phylum Annelida\nThe annelids and the mollusks are the most familiar of the lophotrochozoan protostomes. They are also more \u201ctypical\u201d\nlophotrochozoans, since both groups include aquatic species with trochophore larvae, which unite both taxa in common\nancestry. These phyla show how a flexible body plan can lead to biological success in terms of abundance and species diversity.\nThe phylum Mollusca has the second greatest number of species of all animal phyla with nearly 100,000 described extant\nspecies, and about 80,000 described extinct species. In fact, it is estimated that about 25 percent of all known marine species\nare mollusks! The annelids and mollusca are both bilaterally symmetrical, cephalized, triploblastic, schizocoelous\neucoeolomates They include animals you are likely to see in your backyard or on your dinner plate!\nPhylum Mollusca\nThe name \u201cMollusca\u201d means \u201csoft\u201d body, since the earliest descriptions of molluscs came from observations of \u201csquishy,\u201d\nunshelled cuttlefish. Molluscs are predominantly a marine group of animals; however, they are also known to inhabit freshwater\nas well as terrestrial habitats. This enormous phylum includes chitons, tusk shells, snails, slugs, nudibranchs, sea butterflies,\nclams, mussels, oysters, squids, octopuses, and nautiluses. Molluscs display a wide range of morphologies in each class and\nsubclass, but share a few key characteristics (Figure 28.21). The chief locomotor structure is usually a muscular foot. Most\ninternal organs are contained in a region called the visceral mass. Overlying the visceral mass is a fold of tissue called the\nmantle; within the cavity formed by the mantle are respiratory structures called gills, that typically fold over the visceral mass.\nThe mouths of most mollusks, except bivalves (e.g., clams) contain a specialized feeding organ called a radula, an abrasive\ntonguelike structure. Finally, the mantle secretes a calcium-carbonate-hardened shell in most molluscs, although this is greatly\nreduced in the class Cephalopoda, which contains the octopuses and squids.\n28.4 \u2022 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Molluscs and Annelids\n745\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 28.21 Molluscan body regions. There are many species and variations of molluscs; this illustration shows the anatomy of an aquatic\ngastropod. In a terrestrial gastropod, the mantle cavity itself would serve as a respiratory organ.\nWhich of the following statements about the anatomy of a mollusc is false?\n1.\nMost molluscs have a radula for grinding food.\n2.\nA digestive gland is connected to the stomach.\n3.\nThe tissue beneath the shell is called the mantle.\n4.\nThe digestive system includes a gizzard, a stomach, a digestive gland, and the intestine.\nThe muscular foot is the ventral-most organ, whereas the mantle is the limiting dorsal organ that folds over the visceral mass.\nThe foot, which is used for locomotion and anchorage, varies in shape and function, depending on the type of mollusk under\nstudy. In shelled mollusks, the foot is usually the same size as the opening of the shell. The foot is both retractable and\nextendable. In the class Cephalopoda (\u201chead-foot\u201d), the foot takes the form of a funnel for expelling water at high velocity from\nthe mantle cavity; and the anterior margin of the foot has been modified into a circle of arms and tentacles.\nThe visceral mass is present above the foot, in the visceral hump. This mass contains digestive, nervous, excretory, reproductive,\nand respiratory systems. Molluscan species that are exclusively aquatic have gills that extend into the mantle cavity, whereas\nsome terrestrial species have \"lungs\" formed from the lining of the mantle cavity. Mollusks are schizocoelous eucoelomates, but\nthe coelomic cavity in adult animals has been largely reduced to a cavity around the heart. However, a reduced coelom\nsometimes surrounds the gonads, part of the kidneys, and intestine as well. This overall coelomic reduction makes the mantle\ncavity the major internal body chamber.\nMost mollusks have a special rasp-like organ, the radula, which bears chitinous filelike teeth. The radula is present in all groups\nexcept the bivalves, and serves to shred or scrape food before it enters the digestive tract. The mantle (also known as the pallium)\nis the dorsal epidermis in mollusks; all mollusks except some cephalopods are specialized to secrete a calcareous shell that\nprotects the animal's soft body.\nMost mollusks are dioecious animals and fertilization occurs externally, although this is not the case in terrestrial mollusks,\nsuch as snails and slugs, or in cephalopods. In most aquatic mollusks, the zygote hatches and produces a trochophore larva,\nwith several bands of cilia around a toplike body, and an additional apical tuft of cilia. In some species, the trochophore may be\nfollowed by additional larval stages, such as a veliger larvae, before the final metamorphosis to the adult form. Most\ncephalopods develop directly into small versions of their adult form.\nClassification of Phylum Mollusca\nPhylum Mollusca comprises a very diverse group of organisms that exhibits a dramatic variety of forms, ranging from chitons to\nsnails to squids, the latter of which typically show a high degree of intelligence. This variability is a consequence of modification\nof the basic body regions, especially the foot and mantle. The phylum is organized into eight classes: Caudofoveata,\nSolenogastres, Monoplacophora, Polyplacophora, Gastropoda, Cephalopoda, Bivalvia, and Scaphopoda. Although each\nmolluscan class appears to be monophyletic, their relationship to one another is unclear and still being reviewed.\nBoth the Caudofoveata and the Solenogastres include shell-less, worm-like animals primarily found in benthic marine habitats.\n746\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nAlthough these animals lack a calcareous shell, they get some protection from calcareous spicules embedded in a cuticle that\ncovers their epidermis. The mantle cavity is reduced, and both groups lack eyes, tentacles, and nephridia (excretory organs). The\nCaudofoveata possess a radula, but the Solenogastres do not have a radula or gills. The foot is also reduced in the Solenogastres\nand absent from the Caudofoveata.\nLong thought to be extinct, the first living specimens of Monoplacophora, Neopilina galatheae, were discovered in 1952 on the\nocean bottom near the west coast of Costa Rica. Today there are over 25 described species. Members of class Monoplacophora\n(\u201cbearing one plate\u201d) possess a single, cap-like shell that covers the dorsal body. The morphology of the shell and the underlying\nanimal can vary from circular to ovate. They have a simple radula, a looped digestive system, multiple pairs of excretory organs,\nand a pair of gonads. Multiple gills are located between the foot and the edge of the mantle.\nAnimals in class Polyplacophora (\u201cbearing many plates\u201d) are commonly known as \u201cchitons\u201d and bear eight limy plates that make\nup the dorsal shell (Figure 28.22). These animals have a broad, ventral foot that is adapted for suction onto rocks and other\nsubstrates, and a mantle that extends beyond the edge of the shell. Calcareous spines on the exposed mantle edge provide\nprotection from predators. Respiration is facilitated by multiple pairs of gills in the mantle cavity. Blood from the gills is\ncollected in a posterior heart, and then sent to the rest of the body in a hemocoel\u2014an open circulation system in which the\nblood is contained in connected chambers surrounding various organs rather than within individual blood vessels. The radula,\nwhich has teeth composed of an ultra-hard magnetite, is used to scrape food organisms off rocky surfaces. Chiton teeth have\nbeen shown to exhibit the greatest hardness and stiffness of any biomineral material reported to date, being as much as three-\ntimes harder than human enamel and the calcium carbonate-based shells of mollusks.\nThe nervous system is rudimentary with only buccal or \u201ccheek\u201d ganglia present at the anterior end. Multiple tiny sensory\nstructures, including photosensors, extend from the mantle into channels in the upper layer of the shell. These structures are\ncalled esthetes and are unique to the chitons. Another sensory structure under the radula is used to sample the feeding\nenvironment. A single pair of nephridia is used for the excretion of nitrogenous wastes.\nFigure 28.22 A chiton. This chiton from the class Polyplacaphora has the eight-plated shell for which its class is named. (credit: Jerry\nKirkhart)\nClass Bivalvia (\u201ctwo-valves\u201d) includes clams, oysters, mussels, scallops, geoducks, and shipworms. Some bivalves are almost\nmicroscopic, while others, in the genus Tridacna, may be one meter in length and weigh 225 kilograms. Members of this class\nare found in marine as well as freshwater habitats. As the name suggests, bivalves are enclosed in two-part valves or shells\n(Figure 28.23a) fused on the dorsal side by hinge ligaments as well as shell teeth on the ventral side that keep the two halves\naligned. The two shells, which consist of an outer organic layer, a middle prismatic layer, and a very smooth nacreous layer, are\njoined at the oldest part of the shell called the umbo. Anterior and posterior adductor and abductor muscles close and open the\nshell respectively.\nThe overall body of the bivalve is laterally flattened; the foot is wedge-shaped; and the head region is poorly developed (with no\nobvious mouth). Bivalves are filter-feeders, and a radula is absent in this class of mollusks. The mantle cavity is fused along the\nedges except for openings for the foot and for the intake and expulsion of water, which is circulated through the mantle cavity by\nthe actions of the incurrent and excurrent siphons. During water intake by the incurrent siphon, food particles are captured by\nthe paired posterior gills (ctenidia) and then carried by the movement of cilia forward to the mouth. Excretion and\nosmoregulation are performed by a pair of nephridia. Eyespots and other sensory structures are located along the edge of the\n28.4 \u2022 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Molluscs and Annelids\n747\nmantle in some species. The \"eyes\" are especially conspicuous in scallops (Figure 28.23b). Three pairs of connected ganglia\nregulate activity of different body structures.\nFigure 28.23 Bivalves. These mussels (a), found in the intertidal zone in Cornwall, England, show the bivalve shell. The scallop Argopecten\nirradians (b) has a fluted shell and conspicuous eyespots. (credit (a): Mark A. Wilson. credit (b) Rachael Norris and Marina Freudzon.\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=17251065 (http://openstax.org/l/scallop_eyes) )\nOne of the functions of the mantle is to secrete the shell. Some bivalves, like oysters and mussels, possess the unique ability to\nsecrete and deposit a calcareous nacre or \u201cmother of pearl\u201d around foreign particles that may enter the mantle cavity. This\nproperty has been commercially exploited to produce pearls.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch the animations of bivalves feeding: View the process in clams (http://openstax.org/l/clams) and mussels\n(http://openstax.org/l/mussels) at these sites.\nMore than half of molluscan species are in the class Gastropoda (\u201cstomach foot\u201d), which includes well-known mollusks like\nsnails, slugs, conchs, cowries, limpets, and whelks. Aquatic gastropods include both marine and freshwater species, and all\nterrestrial mollusks are gastropods. Gastropoda includes shell-bearing species as well as species without shells. Gastropod\nbodies are asymmetrical and usually present a coiled shell (Figure 28.24a). Shells may be planospiral (like a garden hose wound\nup), commonly seen in garden snails, or conispiral, (like a spiral staircase), commonly seen in marine conches. Cowrie shells\nhave a polished surface because the mantle extends up over the top of the shell as it is secreted.\nFigure 28.24 Gastropods. Snails(a) and slugs(b) are both gastropods, but slugs lack a shell. (credit a: modification of work by Murray\nStevenson; credit b: modification of work by Rosendahl)\nA key characteristic of some gastropods is the embryonic development of torsion. During this process, the mantle and visceral\nmass are rotated around the perpendicular axis over the center of the foot to bring the anal opening forward just behind the\nhead (Figure 28.25), creating a very peculiar situation. The left gill, kidney, and heart atrium are now on the right side, whereas\nthe original right gill, kidney, and heart atrium are on the left side. Even stranger, the nerve cords have been twisted and\ncontorted into a figure-eight pattern. Because of the space made available by torsion in the mantle cavity, the animal\u2019s sensitive\n748\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nhead end can now be withdrawn into the protection of the shell, and the tougher foot (and sometimes the protective covering or\noperculum) forms a barrier to the outside. The strange arrangement that results from torsion poses a serious sanitation\nproblem by creating the possibility of wastes being washed back over the gills, causing fouling. There is actually no really perfect\nexplanation for the embryonic development of torsion, and some groups that formerly exhibited torsion in their ancestral\ngroups are now known to have reversed the process.\nGastropods also have a foot that is modified for crawling. Most gastropods have a well-defined head with tentacles and eyes. A\ncomplex radula is used to scrape up food particles. In aquatic gastropods, the mantle cavity encloses the gills (ctenidia), but in\nland gastropods, the mantle itself is the major respiratory structure, acting as a kind of lung. Nephridia (\u201ckidneys\u201d) are also\nfound in the mantle cavity.\nFigure 28.25 Torsion in gastropods. During embryonic development of some gastropods, the visceral mass undergoes torsion, or\ncounterclockwise rotation of the visceral anatomical features. As a result, the anus of the adult animal is located over the head. Although\ntorsion is always counterclockwise, the shell may coil in either direction; thus coiling of a shell is not the same as torsion of the visceral\nmass.\nEveryday Connection\nCan Snail Venom Be Used as a Pharmacological Painkiller?\nMarine snails of the genus Conus (Figure 28.26) attack prey with a venomous stinger, modified from the radula. The toxin\nreleased, known as conotoxin, is a peptide with internal disulfide linkages. Conotoxins can bring about paralysis in\nhumans, indicating that this toxin attacks neurological targets. Some conotoxins have been shown to block neuronal ion\nchannels. These findings have led researchers to study conotoxins for possible medical applications.\nConotoxins are an exciting area of potential pharmacological development, since these peptides may be possibly modified\nand used in specific medical conditions to inhibit the activity of specific neurons. For example, conotoxins or modifications\nof them may be used to induce paralysis in muscles in specific health applications, similar to the use of botulinum toxin.\nSince the entire spectrum of conotoxins, as well as their mechanisms of action, is not completely known, the study of their\npotential applications is still in its infancy. Most research to date has focused on their use to treat neurological diseases.\nThey have also shown some efficacy in relieving chronic pain, and the pain associated with conditions like sciatica and\nshingles. The study and use of biotoxins\u2014toxins derived from living organisms\u2014are an excellent example of the application\nof biological science to modern medicine.\n28.4 \u2022 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Molluscs and Annelids\n749\nClass Cephalopoda (\u201chead foot\u201d animals), includes octopuses, squids, cuttlefish, and nautiluses. Cephalopods include both\nanimals with shells as well as animals in which the shell is reduced or absent. In the shell-bearing Nautilus, the spiral shell is\nmulti-chambered. These chambers are filled with gas or water to regulate buoyancy. A siphuncle runs through the chambers,\nand it is this tube that regulates the amount of water and gases (nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen mixture) present in the\nchambers. Ammonites and other nautiloid shells are commonly seen in the fossil record. The shell structure in squids and\ncuttlefish is reduced and is present internally in the form of a squid pen and cuttlefish bone, respectively. Cuttle bone is sold in\npet stores to help smooth the beaks of birds and also to provide birds such as egg-laying chickens and quail with an inexpensive\nnatural source of calcium carbonate. Examples of cephalopods are shown in Figure 28.27.\nCephalopods can display vivid and rapidly changing coloration, almost like flashing neon signs. Typically these flashing displays\nare seen in squids and octopuses, where they may be used for camouflage and possibly as signals for mating displays. We should\nnote, however, that researchers are not entirely sure if squid can actually see color, or see color in the same way as we do. We\nknow that pigments in the skin are contained in special pigment cells (chromatophores), which can expand or contract to\nproduce different color patterns. But chromatophores can only make yellow, red, brown, and black pigmentation; however,\nunderneath them is a whole different set of elements called iridophores and leucophores that reflect light and can make blue,\ngreen, and white. It is possible that squid skin might actually be able to detect some light on its own, without even needing its\neyes!\nAll animals in this class are carnivorous predators and have beak-like jaws in addition to the radula. Cephalopods include the\nmost intelligent of the mollusks, and have a well-developed nervous system along with image-forming eyes. Unlike other\nmollusks, they have a closed circulatory system, in which the blood is entirely contained in vessels rather than in a hemocoel.\nThe foot is lobed and subdivided into arms and tentacles. Suckers with chitinized rings are present on the arms and tentacles of\noctopuses and squid. Siphons are well developed and the expulsion of water is used as their primary mode of locomotion, which\nresembles jet propulsion. Gills (ctenidia) are attached to the wall of the mantle cavity and are serviced by large blood vessels,\neach with its own heart. A pair of nephridia is present within the mantle cavity for water balance and excretion of nitrogenous\nwastes. Cephalopods such as squids and octopuses also produce sepia or a dark ink, which contains melanin. The ink gland is\nlocated between the gills and can be released into the excurrent water stream. Ink clouds can be used either as a \u201csmoke screen\u201d\nto hide the animal from predators during a quick attempt at escape, or to create a fake image to distract predators.\nCephalopods are dioecious. Members of a species mate, and the female then lays the eggs in a secluded and protected niche.\nFemales of some species care for the eggs for an extended period of time and may end up dying during that time period. While\nmost other aquatic mollusks produce trochophore larvae, cephalopod eggs develop directly into a juvenile without an\nintervening larval stage.\nFigure 28.26 Conus. Members of the genus Conus produce neurotoxins that may one day have medical uses. The tube above the eyes\nis a siphon used both to circulate water over the gills and to sample the water for chemical evidence of prey nearby. Note the eyes\nbelow the siphon.

Baecker; credit b: modification of work by Adrian Mohedano; credit c: modification of\nwork by Silke Baron; credit d: modification of work by Angell Williams)\nMembers of class Scaphopoda (\u201cboat feet\u201d) are known colloquially as \u201ctusk shells\u201d or \u201ctooth shells,\u201d as evident when examining\nDentalium, one of the few remaining scaphopod genera (Figure 28.28). Scaphopods are usually buried in sand with the anterior\nopening exposed to water. These animals have a single conical shell, which is open on both ends. The head is not well developed,\nbut the mouth, containing a radula, opens among a group of tentacles that terminate in ciliated bulbs used to catch and\nmanipulate prey. Scaphopods also have a foot similar to that seen in bivalves. Ctenidia are absent in these animals; the mantle\ncavity forms a tube open at both ends and serves as the respiratory structure in these animals.\nFigure 28.28 Tooth shells. Antalis vulgaris shows the classic Dentaliidae shape that gives these animals their common name of \"tusk shell.\"\n(credit: Georges Jansoone)\n28.4 \u2022 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Molluscs and Annelids\n751\nPhylum Annelida\nPhylum Annelida comprises the true, segmented worms. These animals are found in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater\nhabitats, but the presence of water or humidity is a critical factor for their survival in terrestrial habitats. The annelids are often\ncalled \u201csegmented worms\u201d due to their key characteristic of metamerism, or true segmentation. Approximately 22,000 species\nhave been described in phylum Annelida, which includes polychaete worms (marine annelids with multiple appendages), and\noligochaetes (earthworms and leeches). Some animals in this phylum show parasitic and commensal symbioses with other\nspecies in their habitat.\nMorphology\nAnnelids display bilateral symmetry and are worm-like in overall morphology. The name of the phylum is derived from the Latin\nword annullus, which means a small ring, an apt description of the ring-like segmentation of the body. Annelids have a body\nplan with metameric segmentation, in which several internal and external morphological features are repeated in each body\nsegment. Metamerism allows animals to become bigger by adding \u201ccompartments,\u201d while making their movement more\nefficient. The overall body can be divided into head, body, and pygidium (or tail). During development, the segments behind the\nhead arise sequentially from a growth region anterior to the pygidium, a pattern called teloblastic growth. In the Oligochaetes,\nthe clitellum is a reproductive structure that generates mucus to aid sperm transfer and also produces a \u201ccocoon,\u201d within which\nfertilization occurs; it appears as a permanent, fused band located on the anterior third of the animal (Figure 28.29).\nFigure 28.29 The clitellum of an earthworm. The clitellum, seen here as a protruding segment with different coloration than the rest of the\nbody, is a structure that aids in oligochaete reproduction. (credit: Rob Hille)\nAnatomy\nThe epidermis is protected by a collagenous, external cuticle, which is much thinner than the cuticle found in the ecdysozoans\nand does not require periodic shedding for growth. Circular as well as longitudinal muscles are located interior to the\nepidermis. Chitinous bristles called setae (or chaetae) are anchored in the epidermis, each with its own muscle. In the\npolychaetes, the setae are borne on paired appendages called parapodia.\nMost annelids have a well-developed and complete digestive system. Feeding mechanisms vary widely across the phylum. Some\npolychaetes are filter-feeders that use feather-like appendages to collect small organisms. Others have tentacles, jaws, or an\neversible pharynx to capture prey. Earthworms collect small organisms from soil as they burrow through it, and most leeches\nare blood-feeders armed with teeth or a muscular proboscis. In earthworms, the digestive tract includes a mouth, muscular\npharynx, esophagus, crop, and muscular gizzard. The gizzard leads to the intestine, which ends in an anal opening in the\nterminal segment. A cross-sectional view of a body segment of an earthworm is shown in Figure 28.30; each segment is limited\nby a membranous septum that divides the coelomic cavity into a series of compartments.\nMost annelids possess a closed circulatory system of dorsal and ventral blood vessels that run parallel to the alimentary canal as\nwell as capillaries that service individual tissues. In addition, the dorsal and ventral vessels are connected by transverse loops in\nevery segment. Some polychaetes and leeches have an open system in which the major blood vessels open into a hemocoel. In\nmany species, the blood contains hemoglobin, but not contained in cells. Annelids lack a well-developed respiratory system, and\ngas exchange occurs across the moist body surface. In the polychaetes, the parapodia are highly vascular and serve as respiratory\nstructures. Excretion is facilitated by a pair of metanephridia (a type of primitive \u201ckidney\u201d that consists of a convoluted tubule\n752\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nand an open, ciliated funnel) that is present in every segment toward the ventral side. Annelids show well-developed nervous\nsystems with a ring of fused ganglia present around the pharynx. The nerve cord is ventral in position and bears enlarged nodes\nor ganglia in each segment.\nFigure 28.30 Segmental anatomy of an earthworm. This schematic drawing shows the basic anatomy of annelids in a cross-sectional view.\nAnnelids may be either monoecious with permanent gonads (as in earthworms and leeches) or dioecious with temporary or\nseasonal gonads (as in polychaetes). However, cross-fertilization is preferred even in hermaphroditic animals. Earthworms may\nshow simultaneous mutual fertilization when they are aligned for copulation. Some leeches change their sex over their\nreproductive lifetimes. In most polychaetes, fertilization is external and development includes a trochophore larva, which then\nmetamorphoizes to the adult form. In oligochaetes, fertilization is typically internal and the fertilized eggs develop in a cocoon\nproduced by the clitellum; development is direct. Polychaetes are excellent regenerators and some even reproduce asexually by\nbudding or fragmentation.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis combination video and animation (http://shapeoflife.org/video/animation/annelid-animation-body-plan) provides a close-\nup look at annelid anatomy.\nClassification of Phylum Annelida\nPhylum Annelida contains the class Polychaeta (the polychaetes) and the class Oligochaeta (the earthworms, leeches, and their\nrelatives). The earthworms and the leeches form a monophyletic clade within the polychaetes, which are therefore paraphyletic\nas a group.\nThere are more than 22,000 different species of annelids, and more than half of these are marine polychaetes (\"many bristles\").\nIn the polychaetes, bristles are arranged in clusters on their parapodia\u2014fleshy, flat, paired appendages that protrude from each\nsegment. Many polychaetes use their parapodia to crawl along the sea floor, but others are adapted for swimming or floating.\nSome are sessile, living in tubes. Some polychaetes live near hydrothermal vents. These deepwater tubeworms have no digestive\ntract, but have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria living in their bodies.\nEarthworms are the most abundant members of the class Oligochaeta (\"few bristles\"), distinguished by the presence of a\npermanent clitellum as well as the small number of reduced chaetae on each segment. (Recall that oligochaetes do not have\nparapodia.) The oligochaete subclass Hirudinea, includes leeches such as the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, which is\neffective at increasing blood circulation and breaking up blood clots, and thus can be used to treat some circulatory disorders\nand cardiovascular diseases. Their use goes back thousands of years. These animals produce a seasonal clitellum, unlike the\npermanent clitellum of other oligochaetes. A significant difference between leeches and other annelids is the lack of setae and\nthe development of suckers at the anterior and posterior ends, which are used to attach to the host animal. Additionally, in\nleeches, the segmentation of the body wall may not correspond to the internal segmentation of the coelomic cavity. This\nadaptation possibly helps the leeches to elongate when they ingest copious quantities of blood from host vertebrates, a condition\nin which they are said to be \u201cengorged.\u201d The subclass Brachiobdella includes tiny leechlike worms that attach themselves to the\n28.4 \u2022 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa: Molluscs and Annelids\n753\ngills or body surface of crayfish.\nFigure 28.31 Annelid groups.

Shepherd;\ncredit b: modification of work by \u201cSarah G...\u201d/Flickr; credit c: modification of work by Chris Gotschalk, NOAA)\n28.5 Superphylum Ecdysozoa: Nematodes and Tardigrades\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the structural organization of nematodes\n\u2022\nDescribe the importance of Caenorhabditis elegans in research\n\u2022\nDescribe the features of Tardigrades\nSuperphylum Ecdysozoa\nThe superphylum Ecdysozoa contains an incredibly large number of species. This is because it contains two of the most diverse\nanimal groups: phylum Nematoda (the roundworms) and phylum Arthropoda (the arthropods). The most prominent\ndistinguishing feature of ecdysozoans is the cuticle\u2014a tough, but flexible exoskeleton that protects these animals from water\nloss, predators, and other dangers of the external environment. One small phylum within the Ecdysozoa, with exceptional\nresistance to desiccation and other environmental hazards, is the Tardigrada. The nematodes, tardigrades, and arthropods all\nbelong to the superphylum Ecdysozoa, which is believed to be monophyletic\u2014a clade consisting of all evolutionary descendants\nfrom one common ancestor. All members of this superphylum periodically go through a molting process that culminates in\necdysis\u2014the actual shedding of the old exoskeleton. (The term \u201cecdysis\u201d translates roughly as \u201ctake off\u201d or \u201cstrip.\u201d) During the\nmolting process, old cuticle is replaced by a new cuticle, which is secreted beneath it, and which will last until the next growth\nperiod.\nPhylum Nematoda\nThe Nematoda, like other members of the superphylum Ecdysozoa, are triploblastic and possess an embryonic mesoderm that is\nsandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm. They are also bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that a longitudinal section\nwill divide them into right and left sides that are superficially symmetrical. In contrast with flatworms, nematodes are\npseudocoelomates and show a tubular morphology and circular cross-section. Nematodes include both free-living and parasitic\nforms.\nIn 1914, N.A. Cobb said, \u201cIn short, if all the matter in the universe except the nematodes were swept away, our world would still\nbe dimly recognizable, and if, as disembodied spirits, we could then investigate it, we should find its mountains, hills, vales,\nrivers, lakes and oceans represented by a thin film of nematodes...\u201d To paraphrase Cobb, nematodes are so abundant that if all\nthe non-nematode matter of the biosphere were removed, there would still remain a shadow of the former world outlined by\nnematodes!1 The phylum Nematoda includes more than 28,000 species with an estimated 16,000 being parasitic in nature.\nHowever, nematologists believe there may be over one million unclassified species.\nThe name Nematoda is derived from the Greek word \u201cNemos,\u201d which means \u201cthread,\u201d and includes all true roundworms.\nNematodes are present in all habitats, typically with each species occurring in great abundance. The free-living nematode,\nCaenorhabditis elegans, has been extensively used as a model system for many different avenues of biological inquiry in\nlaboratories all over the world.\n1Stoll, N. R., \u201cThis wormy world. 1947,\u201d Journal of Parasitology 85(3) (1999): 392-396.\n754\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nMorphology\nThe cylindrical body form of the nematodes is seen in Figure 28.32. These animals have a complete digestive system with a\ndistinct mouth and anus, whereas only one opening is present in the digestive tract of flatworms. The mouth opens into a\nmuscular pharynx and intestine, which leads to a rectum and anal opening at the posterior end. The epidermis can be either a\nsingle layer of cells or a syncytium\u2014a multinucleated tissue that in this case is formed by the fusion of many single cells. The\ncuticle of nematodes is rich in collagen and a polymer called chitin, which forms a protective armor outside the epidermis. The\ncuticle extends into both ends of the digestive tract, the pharynx, and rectum. In the head, an anterior mouth opening is\ncomposed of three (or six) \u201clips\u201d as well as teeth derived from the cuticle (in some species). Some nematodes may present other\nmodifications of the cuticle such as rings, head shields, or warts. These external rings, however, do not reflect true internal body\nsegmentation, which as we have seen is a hallmark of phylum Annelida. The attachment of the muscles of nematodes differs\nfrom that of most animals: they have a longitudinal layer only, and their direct attachment to the dorsal and ventral nerve cords\ncreates a strong muscular contraction that results in a whiplike, almost spastic, body movement.\nFigure 28.32 Nematode morphology. Scanning electron micrograph shows (a) the soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) and a\nnematode egg. (b) A schematic representation shows the anatomy of a typical nematode. (credit a: modification of work by USDA ARS;\nscale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nExcretory System\nIn nematodes, specialized excretory systems are not well developed. Nitrogenous wastes, largely in the form of ammonia, are\nreleased directly across the body wall. In some nematodes, osmoregulation and salt balance are performed by simple excretory\ncells or glands that may be connected to paired canals that release wastes through an anterior pore. In marine nematodes, the\nexcretory cells are called renette cells, which are unique to nematodes.\nNervous system\nMost nematodes have four longitudinal nerve cords that run along the length of the body in dorsal, ventral, and lateral\npositions. The ventral nerve cord is better developed than the dorsal and lateral cords. Nonetheless, all nerve cords fuse at the\n28.5 \u2022 Superphylum Ecdysozoa: Nematodes and Tardigrades\n755\nanterior end, to form a pharyngeal nerve ring around the pharynx, which acts as the head ganglion or the \u201cbrain\u201d of the\nroundworm. A similar fusion forms a posterior ganglion at the tail. In C. elegans, the nervous system accounts for nearly one-\nthird of the total number of cells in the animal!\nReproduction\nNematodes employ a variety of reproductive strategies ranging from monoecious to dioecious to parthenogenetic, depending\nupon the species. C. elegans is a mostly monoecious species with both self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and some males. In the\nhermaphrodites, ova and sperm develop at different times in the same gonad. Ova are contained in a uterus and amoeboid\nsperm are contained in a spermatheca (\"sperm receptacle\"). The uterus has an external opening known as the vulva. The female\ngenital pore is near the middle of the body, whereas the male genital pore is nearer to the tip. In anatomical males, specialized\nstructures called copulatory spicules at the tail of the male keep him in place and open the vulva of the female into which the\namoeboid sperm travel into the spermatheca.\nFertilization is internal, and embryonic development starts very soon after fertilization. The embryo is released from the vulva\nduring the gastrulation stage. The embryonic development stage lasts for 14 hours; development then continues through four\nsuccessive larval stages with molting and ecdysis taking place between each stage\u2014L1, L2, L3, and L4\u2014ultimately leading to the\ndevelopment of a young adult worm. Adverse environmental conditions such as overcrowding or lack of food can result in the\nformation of an intermediate larval stage known as the dauer larva. An unusual feature of some nematodes is eutely: the body of\na given species contains a specific number of cells as the consequence of a rigid developmental pathway.\nEveryday Connection\nC. elegans: The Model System for Linking Developmental Studies with Genetics\nIf biologists wanted to research how nicotine dependence develops in the body, how lipids are regulated, or observe the\nattractant or repellant properties of certain odors, they would clearly need to design three very different experiments.\nHowever, they might only need one subject of study: Caenorhabditis elegans. The nematode C. elegans was brought into the\nfocus of mainstream biological research by Dr. Sydney Brenner. Since 1963, Dr. Brenner and scientists worldwide have used\nthis animal as a model system to study many different physiological and developmental mechanisms.\nC. elegans is a free-living nematode found in soil. Only about a millimeter long, it can be cultured on agar plates (10,000\nworms/plate!), feeding on the common intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli (another long-term resident of biological\nlaboratories worldwide), and therefore can be readily grown and maintained in a laboratory. The biggest asset of this\nnematode is its transparency, which helps researchers to observe and monitor changes within the animal with ease. It is\nalso a simple organism with about 1,000 cells and a genome of only 20,000 genes. Its chromosomes are organized into five\npairs of autosomes plus a pair of sex chromosomes, making it an ideal candidate with which to study genetics. Since every\ncell can be visualized and identified, this organism is useful for studying cellular phenomena like cell-to-cell interactions,\ncell-fate determinations, cell division, apoptosis (cell death), and intracellular transport.\nAnother tremendous asset is the short life cycle of this worm (Figure 28.33). It takes only three days to achieve the \u201cegg to\nadult to daughter egg\u201d; therefore, the developmental consequences of genetic changes can be quickly identified. The total\nlife span of C. elegans is two to three weeks; hence, age-related phenomena are also easy to observe. There are two sexes in\nthis species: hermaphrodites (XX) and males (XO). However, anatomical males are relatively infrequently obtained from\nmatings between hermaphrodites, since their XO chromosome composition requires meiotic nondisjunction when both\nparents are XX. Another feature that makes C. elegans an excellent experimental model is that the position and number of\nthe 959 cells present in adult hermaphrodites of this organism is constant. This feature is extremely significant when\nstudying cell differentiation, cell-to-cell communication, and apoptosis. Lastly, C. elegans is also amenable to genetic\nmanipulations using molecular methods, rounding off its usefulness as a model system.\nBiologists worldwide have created information banks and groups dedicated to research using C. elegans. Their findings\nhave led, for example, to better understandings of cell communication during development, neuronal signaling, and insight\ninto lipid regulation (which is important in addressing health issues like the development of obesity and diabetes). In recent\nyears, studies have enlightened the medical community with a better understanding of polycystic kidney disease. This\nsimple organism has led biologists to complex and significant findings, growing the field of science in ways that touch the\neveryday world.\n756\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nParasitic Nematodes\nA number of common parasitic nematodes serve as prime examples of parasitism (endoparasitism). These economically and\nmedically important animals exhibit complex life cycles that often involve multiple hosts, and they can have significant medical\nand veterinary impacts. Here is a partial list of nasty nematodes: Humans may become infected by Dracunculus medinensis,\nknown as guinea worms, when they drink unfiltered water containing copepods (Figure 28.34), an intermediate crustacean host.\nHookworms, such as Ancylostoma and Necator, infest the intestines and feed on the blood of mammals, especially of dogs, cats,\nand humans. Trichina worms (Trichinella) are the causal organism of trichinosis in humans, often resulting from the\nconsumption of undercooked pork; Trichinella can infect other mammalian hosts as well. Ascaris, a large intestinal roundworm,\nsteals nutrition from its human host and may create physical blockage of the intestines. The filarial worms, such as Dirofilaria\nand Wuchereria, are commonly vectored by mosquitoes, which pass the infective agents among mammals through their blood-\nsucking activity. One species, Wuchereria bancrofti, infects the lymph nodes of over 120 million people worldwide, usually\nproducing a non-lethal but deforming condition called elephantiasis. In this disease, parts of the body often swell to gigantic\nproportions due to obstruction of lymphatic drainage, inflammation of lymphatic tissues, and resulting edema. Dirofilaria\nimmitis, a blood-infective parasite, is the notorious dog heartworm species.\nFigure 28.33 Caenorhabditis elegans. (a) This light micrograph shows the bodies of a group of roundworms. These hermaphrodites\nconsist of exactly 959 cells. (b) The life cycle of C. elegans has four juvenile stages (L1 through L4) and an adult stage. Under ideal\nconditions, the nematode spends a set amount of time at each juvenile stage, but under stressful conditions, it may enter a dauer state\nthat does not age significantly and is somewhat analogous to the diapausing state of some insects.

They are commonly called \"water bears\" because of their plump bodies and the\nlarge claws on their stubby legs. There are over 1,000 species, most of which are less than 1 mm in length. A chitinous cuticle\ncovers the body surface and may be divided into plates (Figure 28.35). Tardigrades are known for their ability to enter a state\ncalled cryptobiosis, which provides them with are resistance to multiple environmental challenges, including desiccation, very\nlow temperatures, vacuum, high pressure, and radiation. They can suspend their metabolic activity for years, and survive the\nloss of up to 99% of their water content. Their remarkable resistance has recently been attributed to unique proteins that replace\nwater in their cells and protect their internal cell structure and their DNA from damage.\n758\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 28.35 Scanning electronmicrograph of Milnesium tardigradum.

(2012) -https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=22716809 (http://openstax.org/l/waterbear) )\nMorphology and Physiology\nTardigrades have cylindrical bodies, with four pairs of legs terminating in a number of claws. The cuticle is periodically shed,\nincluding the cuticular covering of the claws. The first three pairs of legs are used for walking, and the posterior pair for clinging\nto the substrate. A circular mouth leads to a muscular pharynx and salivary glands. Tardigrades feed on plants, algae, or small\nanimals. Plant cells are pierced with a chitinous stylet and the cellular contents are then sucked into the gut by the muscular\npharynx. Bands of single muscle cells are attached to the various points of the epidermis and extend into the legs to provide\nambulatory movement. The major body cavity is a hemocoel, but there are no specialized circulatory structures for moving the\nblood, nor are there specialized respiratory structures. Malpighian tubules in the hemocoel remove metabolic wastes and\ntransport them to the gut. A dorsal brain is connected to a ventral nerve cord with segmental ganglia associated with the\nappendages. Sensory structures are greatly reduced, but there is a pair of simple eyespots on the head, and sensory cilia or\nbristles concentrated toward the head end of the animal.\nReproduction\nMost tardigrades are dioecious, and males and females each have a single gonad. Mating usually occurs at the time of a molt and\nfertilization is external. Eggs may be deposited in a molted cuticle or attached to other objects. Development is direct, and the\nanimal may molt a dozen times during its lifetime. In tardigrades, like nematodes, development produces a fixed number of\ncells, with the actual number of cells being dependent on the species. Further growth occurs by enlarging the cells, not by\nmultiplying them.\n28.6 Superphylum Ecdysozoa: Arthropods\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nCompare the internal systems and appendage specializations of phylum Arthropoda\n\u2022\nDiscuss the environmental importance of arthropods\n\u2022\nDiscuss the reasons for arthropod success and abundance\nThe superphylum Ecdysozoa also includes the phylum Arthropoda, one of the most successful clades of animals on the planet.\nArthropods are coelomate organisms characterized by a sturdy chitinous exoskeleton and jointed appendages. There are well\nover a million arthropod species described, and systematists believe that there are millions of species awaiting proper\nclassification. Like other Ecdysozoa, all arthropods periodically go through the physiological process of molting, followed by\necdysis (the actual shedding of the exoskeleton), as they grow. Arthropods are eucoelomate, protostomic organisms, often with\nincredibly complicated life cycles.\n28.6 \u2022 Superphylum Ecdysozoa: Arthropods\n759\nPhylum Arthropoda\nThe name \u201carthropoda\u201d means \u201cjointed feet.\u201d The name aptly describes the invertebrates included in this phylum. Arthropods\nhave probably always dominated the animal kingdom in terms of number of species and likely will continue to do so: An\nestimated 85 percent of all known species are included in this phylum! In effect, life on Earth could conceivably be called the Age\nof Arthropods beginning nearly 500 million years ago.\nThe principal characteristics of all the animals in this phylum are the structural and functional segmentation of the body and the\npresence of jointed appendages. Arthropods have an exoskeleton made principally of chitin\u2014a waterproof, tough\npolysaccharide composed of N-acetylglucosamine. Phylum Arthropoda is the most speciose clade in the animal world (Table\n28.1), and insects form the single largest class within this phylum. For comparison, refer to the approximate numbers of species\nin the phyla listed below.\nPhylum\n# species\nCtenophora\n100\nPorifera\n5,000\nCnidaria\n11,000\nPlatyhelminthes\n25,000\nRotifera\n2,000\nNemertea\n1,200\nAnnelida\n22,000\nMollusca\n112,000\nNematoda\n28,000+\nTardigrades\n>1,000\nArthropoda\n1,134,000\nEchinodermata\n7,000\nChordata\n100,000\nTable 28.1\nPhylum Arthropoda includes animals that have been successful in colonizing terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial habitats. This\nphylum is further classified into five subphyla: Trilobita (trilobites, all extinct), Chelicerata (horseshoe crabs, spiders, scorpions,\nticks, mites, and daddy longlegs or harvestmen), Myriapoda (millipedes, centipedes, and their relatives), Crustacea (crabs,\nlobsters, crayfish, isopods, barnacles, and some zooplankton), and Hexapoda (insects and their six-legged relatives). Trilobites,\nan extinct group of arthropods found chiefly in the pre-Cambrian Era (about 500 million years ago), are probably most closely\nrelated to the Chelicerata. These are identified based on their fossils; they were quite diverse and radiated significantly into\nthousands of species before their complete extinction at the end of the Permian about 240 million years ago (Figure 28.36).\n760\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 28.36 A trilobite. Trilobites, like the one in this fossil, are an extinct group of arthropods. Their name \"trilobite\" refers to the three\nlongitudinal lobes making up the body: right pleural lobe, axial lobe, and left pleural lobe (credit: Kevin Walsh).\nMorphology\nCharacteristic features of the arthropods include the presence of jointed appendages, body segmentation, and chitinized\nexoskeleton. Fusion of adjacent groups of segments gave rise to functional body regions called tagmata (singular = tagma).\nTagmata may be in the form of a head, thorax, and abdomen, or a cephalothorax and abdomen, or a head and trunk, depending\non the taxon. Commonly described tagmata may be composed of different numbers of segments; for example, the head of most\ninsects results from the fusion of six ancestral segments, whereas the \u201chead\u201d of another arthropod may be made of fewer\nancestral segments, due to independent evolutionary events. Jointed arthropod appendages, often in segmental pairs, have been\nspecialized for various functions: sensing their environment (antennae), capturing and manipulating food (mandibles and\nmaxillae), as well as for walking, jumping, digging, and swimming.\nIn the arthropod body, a central cavity, called the hemocoel (or blood cavity), is present, and the hemocoel fluids are moved by\ncontraction of regions of the tubular dorsal blood vessel called \"hearts.\" Groups of arthropods also differ in the organs used for\nnitrogenous waste excretion, with crustaceans possessing green glands and insects using Malpighian tubules, which work in\nconjunction with the hindgut to reabsorb water while ridding the body of nitrogenous waste. The nervous system tends to be\ndistributed among the segments, with larger ganglia in segments with sensory structures or appendages. The ganglia are\nconnected by a ventral nerve cord.\nRespiratory systems vary depending on the group of arthropod. Insects and myriapods use a series of tubes (tracheae) that\nbranch through the body, ending in minute tracheoles. These fine respiratory tubes perform gas exchange directly between the\nair and cells within the organism. The major tracheae open to the surface of the cuticle via apertures called spiracles. We should\nnote that these tracheal systems of ventilation have evolved independently in hexapods, myriapods, and arachnids. Although the\ntracheal system works extremely well in terrestrial environments, it also works well in freshwater aquatic environments: In fact,\nnumerous species of aquatic insects in both immature and adult stages possess tracheal systems. However, although there are\ninsects that live on the surface of marine environments, none is strictly marine\u2014meaning that they complete their entire\nmetamorphosis in salt water.\nIn contrast, aquatic crustaceans utilize gills, terrestrial chelicerates employ book lungs, and aquatic chelicerates use book gills\n(Figure 28.37). The book lungs of arachnids (scorpions, spiders, ticks, and mites) contain a vertical stack of hemocoel wall tissue\nthat somewhat resembles the pages of a book. Between each of the \"pages\" of tissue is an air space. This allows both sides of the\ntissue to be in contact with the air at all times, greatly increasing the efficiency of gas exchange. The gills of crustaceans are\nfilamentous structures that exchange gases with the surrounding water.\nThe cuticle is the hard \u201ccovering\u201d of an arthropod. It is made up of two layers: the epicuticle, which is a thin, waxy, water-\nresistant outer layer containing no chitin, and the layer beneath it, the chitinous procuticle, which itself is composed of an\nexocuticle and a lower endocuticle, all supported ultimately by a basement membrane. The exoskeleton is very protective (it is\nsometimes difficult to squish a big beetle!), but does not sacrifice flexibility or mobility. Both the exocuticle (which is secreted\nbefore a molt), and an endocuticle, (which is secreted after a molt), are composed of chitin bound with a protein; chitin is\ninsoluble in water, alkalis, and weak acids. The procuticle is not only flexible and lightweight, but also provides protection\nagainst dehydration and other biological and physical stresses. Some hexapods, such as the crustaceans, add calcium salts to\ntheir exoskeleton, which increases the strength of the cuticle, but does reduce its flexibility. In some cases, such as lobsters, the\namount of calcium salt deposited within the chitin is extreme. In order to grow, the arthropod must \u201cshed\u201d the exoskeleton\nduring the physiological process called molting, following by the actual stripping of the outer cuticle, called ecdysis (\u201cto strip\n28.6 \u2022 Superphylum Ecdysozoa: Arthropods\n761\noff\u201d). At first, this seems to be a dangerous method of growth, because while the new exoskeleton is hardening, the animal is\nvulnerable to predation; however, molting and ecdysis also allow for growth and change in morphology, as well as for great\ndiversification in size, simply because the numbers of molts can be modified through evolution.\nThe characteristic morphology of representative animals from each subphylum is described below.\nFigure 28.37 Arthropod respiratory structures. The book lungs of (a) arachnids are made up of alternating air pockets and hemocoel tissue\nshaped like a stack of books (hence the name, \u201cbook lung\u201d). The book gills of (b) horseshoe crabs are similar to book lungs but are external\nso that gas exchange can occur with the surrounding water.

Chelicerates are predominantly terrestrial, although some freshwater and marine species also exist. An estimated\n77,000 species of chelicerates can be found in almost all terrestrial habitats.\nThe body of chelicerates is divided into two tagmata: prosoma and opisthosoma, which are basically the equivalents of a\ncephalothorax (usually smaller) and an abdomen (usually larger). A distinct \u201chead\u201d tagma is not usually discernible. The phylum\nderives its name from the first pair of appendages: the chelicerae (Figure 28.38), which serve as specialized clawlike or fanglike\nmouthparts. We should note here that chelicerae are actually modified legs, but they are not the exact serial equivalent of\nmandibles, which are the modified leglike chewing mouthparts of insects and crustaceans: The chelicerae are borne on the first\nsegment making up the prosoma, whereas the mandibles are embryonically on the fourth segment of the mandibulate head. The\nchelicerates have secondarily lost their antennae and hence do not have them. Some of the functions of the antennae (such as\ntouch) are now performed by the second pair of appendages\u2014 the pedipalps, which may also be used for general sensing the\nenvironment as well as the manipulation of food. In some species, such as sea spiders, an additional pair of derived leg\nappendages, called ovigers, is present between the chelicerae and pedipalps. Ovigers are used for grooming and by males to\ncarry eggs. In spiders, the chelicerae are often modified and terminate in fangs that inject venom into their prey before feeding\n(Figure 28.39).\n762\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 28.38 Chelicerae. The chelicerae (first set of appendages) are well developed in the scorpion. (credit: Kevin Walsh)\nMost chelicerates ingest food using a preoral cavity formed by the chelicerae and pedipalps. Some chelicerates may secrete\ndigestive enzymes to pre-digest food before ingesting it. Parasitic chelicerates like ticks and mites have evolved blood-sucking\napparatuses. Members of this subphylum have an open circulatory system with a heart that pumps blood into the hemocoel.\nAquatic species, like horseshoe crabs, have gills, whereas terrestrial species have either tracheae or book lungs for gaseous\nexchange. Chelicerate hemolymph contains hemocyanin a copper-containing oxygen transport protein.\nFigure 28.39 Spider. The trapdoor spider, like all spiders, is a member of the subphylum Chelicerata. (credit: Marshal Hedin)\nThe nervous system in chelicerates consists of a brain and two ventral nerve cords. Chelicerates are dioecious, meaning that the\nsexes are separate. These animals use external fertilization as well as internal fertilization strategies for reproduction,\ndepending upon the species and its habitat. Parental care for the young ranges from absolutely none to relatively prolonged\ncare.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/arthropodstory) to click through a lesson on arthropods, including interactive habitat maps,\nand more.\nSubphylum Myriapoda\nSubphylum Myriapoda comprises arthropods with numerous legs. Although the name is misleading, suggesting that thousands\n28.6 \u2022 Superphylum Ecdysozoa: Arthropods\n763\nof legs are present in these invertebrates, the number of legs typically varies from 10 to 750. This subphylum includes 16,000\nspecies; the most commonly found examples are millipedes and centipedes. Virtually all myriapods are terrestrial animals and\nprefer a humid environment. Ancient myriapods (or myriapod-like arthropods) from the Silurian to the Devonian grew up to 10\nfeet in length (three meters). Unfortunately, they are all extinct!\nMyriapods are typically found in moist soils, decaying biological material, and leaf litter. Subphylum Myriapoda is divided into\nfour classes: Chilopoda, Symphyla, Diplopoda, and Pauropoda. Centipedes like Scutigera coleoptrata (Figure 28.40) are\nclassified as chilopods. These animals bear one pair of legs per segment, mandibles as mouthparts, and are somewhat\ndorsoventrally flattened. The legs in the first segment are modified to form forcipules (poison claws) that deliver poison to prey\nlike spiders and cockroaches, as these animals are all predatory. Symphyla are similar to centipedes, but lack the poison claws\nand are vegetarian. Millipedes bear two pairs of legs per diplosegment\u2014a feature that results from the embryonic fusion of\nadjacent pairs of body segments. These arthropods are usually rounder in cross-section than centipedes, and are herbivores or\ndetritivores. Millipedes have visibly more numbers of legs as compared to centipedes, although they do not have a thousand legs\n(Figure 28.40b). The Pauropods are similar to millipedes, but have fewer segments.\nFigure 28.40 Myriapods. The centipede Scutigera coleoptrata (a) has up to 15 pairs of legs. The North American millipede Narceus\namericanus (b) bears many legs, although not a thousand, as its name might suggest. (credit a: modification of work by Bruce Marlin; credit\nb: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\nSubphylum Crustacea\nCrustaceans are the most dominant aquatic (both freshwater and marine) arthropods, with the total number of marine\ncrustaceans standing at about 70,000 species. Krill, shrimp, lobsters, crabs, and crayfish are examples of crustaceans (Figure\n28.41). However, there are also a number of terrestrial crustacean species as well: Terrestrial species like the wood lice\n(Armadillidium spp), also called pill bugs, roly-polies, potato bugs, or isopods, are also crustaceans. Nonetheless, the number of\nterrestrial species in this subphylum is relatively low.\nFigure 28.41 Crustaceans. The (a) crab and (b) shrimp krill are both aquatic crustaceans. The pill bug Armadillidium is a terrestrial\ncrustacean.

Since biramous appendages are also seen in the\ntrilobites, biramous appendages represent the ancestral condition in the arthropods. Currently, we describe various arthropods\nas having uniramous or biramous appendages, but these are descriptive only, and do not necessarily reflect evolutionary\nrelationships other than that all jointed legs of arthropods share common ancestry.\n764\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 28.42 Arthropod appendages. Arthropods may have (a) biramous (two-branched) appendages or (b) uniramous (one-branched)\nappendages. (credit b: modification of work by Nicholas W. Beeson)\nIn most crustaceans, the head and thorax is fused to form a cephalothorax (Figure 28.43), which is covered by a plate called the\ncarapace, thus producing a body plan comprising two tagmata: cephalophorax and abdomen. Crustaceans have a chitinous\nexoskeleton that is shed by molting and ecdysis whenever the animal requires an increase in size or the next stage of\ndevelopment. The exoskeletons of many aquatic species are also infused with calcium carbonate, which makes them even\nstronger than those of other arthropods. Crustaceans have an open circulatory system where blood is pumped into the hemocoel\nby the dorsally located heart. Hemocyanin is the major respiratory pigment present in crustaceans, but hemoglobin is found in a\nfew species and both are dissolved in the hemolymph rather than carried in cells.\nFigure 28.43 Crustacean anatomy. The crayfish is an example of a crustacean. It has a carapace around the cephalothorax and the heart in\nthe dorsal thorax area. (credit: Jane Whitney)\nAs in the chelicerates, most crustaceans are dioecious. However, some species like barnacles may be hermaphrodites. Serial\nhermaphroditism, where the gonad can switch from producing sperm to ova, is also exhibited in some species. Fertilized eggs\nmay be held within the female of the species or may be released in the water. Terrestrial crustaceans seek out damp spaces in\ntheir habitats to lay eggs.\nLarval stages\u2014nauplius or zoea\u2014are seen in the early development of aquatic crustaceans. A cypris larva is also seen in the early\ndevelopment of barnacles (Figure 28.44).\n28.6 \u2022 Superphylum Ecdysozoa: Arthropods\n765\nFigure 28.44 Crustacean larvae. All crustaceans go through different larval stages.

Kimmel based on original work by Ernst\nHaeckel)\nCrustaceans possess a brain formed by the fusion of the first three segmental ganglia, as well as two compound eyes. A ventral\nnerve cord connects additional segmental ganglia. Most crustaceans are carnivorous, but herbivorous and detritivorous species,\nand even endoparasitic species are known. A highly evolved endoparasitic species, such as Sacculina spp, parasitizes its crab\nhost and ultimately destroys it after it forces the host to incubate the parasite\u2019s eggs! Crustaceans may also be cannibalistic when\nextremely high populations of these organisms are present.\nSubphylum Hexapoda\nThe insects comprise the largest class of arthropods in terms of species diversity as well as in terms of biomass\u2014at least in\nterrestrial habitats.\nThe name Hexapoda describes the presence of six legs (three pairs) in these animals, which differentiates them from other\ngroups of arthropods that have different numbers of legs. In some cases, however, the number of legs has been evolutionarily\nreduced, or the legs have been highly modified to accommodate specific conditions, such as endoparasitism. Hexapod bodies\nare organized into three tagmata: head, thorax, and abdomen. Individual segments of the head have mouthparts derived from\njointed legs, and the thorax has three pairs of jointed appendages, and also wings, in most derived groups. For example, in the\npterygotes (winged insects), in addition to a pair of jointed legs on all three segments comprising the thorax: prothorax,\nmesothorax, and metathorax.\nAppendages found on other body segments are also evolutionarily derived from modified legs. Typically, the head bears an\nupper \u201clip\u201d or labrum and mandibles (or derivation of mandibles) that serve as mouthparts; maxillae, and a lower \u201clip\u201d called a\nlabium: both of which manipulate food. The head also has one pair of sensory antennae, as well as sensory organs such as a pair\nof compound eyes, ocelli (simple eyes), and numerous sensory hairs. The abdomen usually has 11 segments and bears external\nreproductive apertures. The subphylum Hexapoda includes some insects that are winged (such as fruit flies) and others that are\nsecondarily wingless (such as fleas). The only order of \u201cprimitively wingless\u201d insects is the Thysanura, the bristletails. All other\norders are winged or are descendants of formally winged insects.\nThe evolution of wings is a major, unsolved mystery. Unlike vertebrates, whose \u201cwings\u201d are simply preadaptations of \u201carms\u201d that\nserved as the structural foundations for the evolution of functional wings (this has occurred independently in pterosaurs,\ndinosaurs [birds], and bats), the evolution of wings in insects is a what we call a de novo (new) development that has given the\npteryogotes domination over the Earth. Winged insects existed over 425 million years ago, and by the Carboniferous, several\norders of winged insects (Paleoptera), most of which are now extinct, had evolved. There is good physical evidence that\nPaleozoic nymphs with thoracic winglets (perhaps hinged, former gill covers of semi-aquatic species) used these devices on land\nto elevate the thoracic temperature (the thorax is where the legs are located) to levels that would enable them to escape predators\nfaster, find more food resources and mates, and disperse more easily. The thoracic winglets (which can be found on fossilized\ninsects preceding the advent of truly winged insects) could have easily been selected for thermoregulatory purposes prior to\n766\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nreaching a size that would have allowed them the capacity for gliding or actual flapping flight. Even modern insects with broadly\nattached wings, such as butterflies, use the basal one-third of their wings (the area next to the thorax) for thermoregulation, and\nthe outer two-thirds for flight, camouflage, and mate selection.\nMany of the common insects we encounter on a daily basis\u2014including ants, beetles, cockroaches, butterflies, crickets and\nflies\u2014are examples of Hexapoda. Among these, adult ants, beetles, flies, and butterflies develop by complete metamorphosis\nfrom grub-like or caterpillar-like larvae, whereas adult cockroaches and crickets develop through a gradual or incomplete\nmetamorphosis from wingless immatures. All growth occurs during the juvenile stages. Adults do not grow further (but may\nbecome larger) after their final molt. Variations in wing, leg, and mouthpart morphology all contribute to the enormous variety\nseen in the insects. Insect variability was also encouraged by their activity as pollinators and their coevolution with flowering\nplants. Some insects, especially termites, ants, bees, and wasps, are eusocial, meaning that they live in large groups with\nindividuals assigned to specific roles or castes, like queen, drone, and worker. Social insects use pheromones\u2014external\nchemical signals\u2014to communicate and maintain group structure as well as a cohesive colony.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 28.45 Insect anatomy. In this basic anatomy of a hexapod insect, note that insects have a well-developed digestive system (yellow),\na respiratory system (blue), a circulatory system (red), and a nervous system (purple). Note the multiple \"hearts\" and the segmental\nganglia.\nWhich of the following statements about insects is false?\na.\nInsects have both dorsal and ventral blood vessels.\nb.\nInsects have spiracles, openings that allow air to enter into the tracheal system.\nc.\nThe trachea is part of the digestive system.\nd.\nMost insects have a well-developed digestive system with a mouth, crop, and intestine.\n28.7 Superphylum Deuterostomia\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the distinguishing characteristics of echinoderms\n\u2022\nDescribe the distinguishing characteristics of chordates\nThe phyla Echinodermata and Chordata (the phylum that includes humans) both belong to the superphylum Deuterostomia.\nRecall that protostomes and deuterostomes differ in certain aspects of their embryonic development, and they are named based\non which opening of the archenteron (primitive gut tube) develops first. The word deuterostome comes from the Greek word\nmeaning \u201cmouth second,\u201d indicating that the mouth develops as a secondary structure opposite the location of the blastopore,\nwhich becomes the anus. In protostomes (\u201cmouth first\u201d), the first embryonic opening becomes the mouth, and the second\nopening becomes the anus.\n28.7 \u2022 Superphylum Deuterostomia\n767\nThere are a series of other developmental characteristics that differ between protostomes and deuterostomes, including the type\nof early cleavage (embryonic cell division) and the mode of formation of the coelom of the embryo: Protosomes typically exhibit\nspiral mosaic cleavage whereas deuterostomes exhibit radial regulative cleavage. In deuterostomes, the endodermal lining of\nthe archenteron usually forms buds called coelomic pouches that expand and ultimately obliterate the embryonic blastocoel (the\ncavity within the blastula and early gastrula) to become the embryonic mesoderm, the third germ layer. This happens when the\nmesodermal pouches become separated from the invaginating endodermal layer forming the archenteron, then expand and\nfuse to form the coelomic cavity. The resulting coelom is termed an enterocoelom. The archenteron develops into the alimentary\ncanal, and a mouth opening is formed by invagination of ectoderm at the pole opposite the blastopore of the gastrula. The\nblastopore forms the anus of the alimentary system in the juvenile and adult forms. Cleavage in most deuterostomes is also\nindeterminant, meaning that the developmental fates of early embryonic cells are not decided at that point of embryonic\ndevelopment (this is why we could potentially clone most deuterostomes, including ourselves).\nThe deuterostomes consist of two major clades\u2014the Chordata and the Ambulacraria. The Chordata include the vertebrates and\ntwo invertebrate subphyla, the urochordates and the cephalochordates. The Ambulacraria include the echinoderms and the\nhemichordates, which were once considered to be a chordate subphylum (Figure 28.46). The two clades, in addition to being\ndeuterostomes, have some other interesting features in common. As we have seen, the vast majority of invertebrate animals do\nnot possess a defined bony vertebral endoskeleton, or a bony cranium. However, one of the most ancestral groups of\ndeuterostome invertebrates, the Echinodermata, do produce tiny skeletal \u201cbones\u201d called ossicles that make up a true\nendoskeleton, or internal skeleton, covered by an epidermis. The Hemichordata (acorn worms and pterobranchs) will not be\ncovered here, but share with the echinoderms a three-part (tripartite) coelom, similar larval forms, and a derived\nmetanephridium that rids the animals of nitrogenous wastes. They also share pharyngeal slits with the chordates (Figure 28.46).\nIn addition, hemichordates have a dorsal nerve cord in the midline of the epidermis, but lack a neural tube, a true notochord\nand the endostyle and post-anal tail characteristic of chordates.\nFigure 28.46 Ambulacraria and Chordata.

Sea stars\n(Figure 28.47), sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sand dollars, and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms.\nMorphology and Anatomy\nDespite the adaptive value of bilaterality for most free-living cephalized animals, adult echinoderms exhibit pentaradial\nsymmetry (with \u201carms\u201d typically arrayed in multiples of five around a central axis). Echinoderms have an endoskeleton made of\ncalcareous ossicles (small bony plates), covered by the epidermis. For this reason, it is an endoskeleton like our own, not an\nexoskeleton like that of arthropods. The ossicles may be fused together, embedded separately in the connective tissue of the\ndermis, or be reduced to minute spicules of bone as in sea cucumbers. The spines for which the echinoderms are named are\nconnected to some of the plates. The spines may be moved by small muscles, but they can also be locked into place for defense. In\nsome species, the spines are surrounded by tiny stalked claws called pedicellaria, which help keep the animal's surface clean of\ndebris, protect papulae used in respiration, and sometimes aid in food capture.\nThe endoskeleton is produced by dermal cells, which also produce several kinds of pigments, imparting vivid colors to these\nanimals. In sea stars, fingerlike projections (papillae) of dermal tissue extend through the endoskeleton and function as gills.\n768\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nSome cells are glandular, and may produce toxins. Each arm or section of the animal contains several different structures: for\nexample, digestive glands, gonads, and the tube feet that are unique to the echinoderms. In echinoderms like sea stars, every\narm bears two rows of tube feet on the oral side, running along an external ambulacral groove. These tube feet assist in\nlocomotion, feeding, and chemical sensations, as well as serve to attach some species to the substratum.\nFigure 28.47 Anatomy of a sea star. This diagram of a sea star shows the pentaradial pattern typical of adult echinoderms, and the water\nvascular system that is their defining characteristic.\nWater Vascular and Hemal Systems\nEchinoderms have a unique ambulacral (water vascular) system, derived from part of the coelom, or \u201cbody cavity.\u201d The water\nvascular system consists of a central ring canal and radial canals that extend along each arm. Each radial canal is connected to a\ndouble row of tube feet, which project through holes in the endoskeleton, and function as tactile and ambulatory structures.\nThese tube feet can extend or retract based on the volume of water present in the system of that arm, allowing the animal to\nmove and also allowing it to capture prey with their suckerlike action. Individual tube feet are controlled by bulblike ampullae.\nSeawater enters the system through an aboral madreporite (opposite the oral area where the mouth is located) and passes to the\nring canal through a short stone canal. Water circulating through these structures facilitates gaseous exchange and provides a\nhydrostatic source for locomotion and prey manipulation. A hemal system, consisting of oral, gastric, and aboral rings, as well\nas other vessels running roughly parallel to the water vascular system, circulates nutrients. Transport of nutrients and gases is\nshared by the water vascular and hemal systems in addition to the visceral body cavity that surrounds the major organs.\nNervous System\nThe nervous system in these animals is a relatively simple, comprising a circumoral nerve ring at the center and five radial\nnerves extending outward along the arms. In addition, several networks of nerves are located in different parts of the body.\nHowever, structures analogous to a brain or large ganglia are not present in these animals. Depending on the group,\nechinoderms may have well-developed sensory organs for touch and chemoreception (e.g., within the tube feet and on tentacles\nat the tips of the arms), as well as photoreceptors and statocysts.\nDigestive and Excretory Systems\nA mouth, located on the oral (ventral) side, opens through a short esophagus to a large, baglike stomach. The so-called \u201ccardiac\u201d\nstomach can be everted through the mouth during feeding (for example, when a starfish everts its stomach into a bivalve prey\nitem to digest the animal\u2014alive\u2014within its own shell!) There are masses of digestive glands (pyloric caeca) in each arm,\nrunning dorsally along the arms and overlying the reproductive glands below them. After passing through the pyloric caeca in\neach arm, the digested food is channeled to a small anus, if one exists.\nPodocytes\u2014cells specialized for ultrafiltration of bodily fluids\u2014are present near the center of the echinoderm disc, at the\njunction of the water vascular and hemal systems. These podocytes are connected by an internal system of canals to the\n28.7 \u2022 Superphylum Deuterostomia\n769\nmadreporite, where water enters the stone canal. The adult echinoderm typically has a spacious and fluid-filled coelom. Cilia\naid in circulating the fluid within the body cavity, and lead to the fluid-filled papulae, where the exchange of oxygen and carbon\ndioxide takes place, as well as the secretion of nitrogenous waste such as ammonia, by diffusion.\nReproduction\nEchinoderms are dioecious, but males and females are indistinguishable apart from their gametes. Males and females release\ntheir gametes into water at the same time and fertilization is external. The early larval stages of all echinoderms (e.g., the\nbipinnaria of asteroid echinoderms such as sea stars) have bilateral symmetry, although each class of echinoderms has its own\nlarval form. The radially symmetrical adult forms from a cluster of cells in the larva. Sea stars, brittle stars, and sea cucumbers\nmay also reproduce asexually by fragmentation, as well as regenerate body parts lost in trauma, even when over 75 percent of\ntheir body mass is lost!\nClasses of Echinoderms\nThis phylum is divided into five extant classes: Asteroidea (sea stars), Ophiuroidea (brittle stars), Echinoidea (sea urchins and\nsand dollars), Crinoidea (sea lilies or feather stars), and Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers) (Figure 28.48).\nThe most well-known echinoderms are members of class Asteroidea, or sea stars. They come in a large variety of shapes, colors,\nand sizes, with more than 1,800 species known so far. The key characteristic of sea stars that distinguishes them from other\nechinoderm classes includes thick arms that extend from a central disk from which various body organs branch into the arms.\nAt the end of each arm are simple eye spots and tentacles that serve as touch receptors. Sea stars use their rows of tube feet not\nonly for gripping surfaces but also for grasping prey. Most sea stars are carnivores and their major prey are in the phylum\nMollusca. By manipulating its tube feet, a sea star can open molluscan shells. Sea stars have two stomachs, one of which can\nprotrude through their mouths and secrete digestive juices into or onto prey, even before ingestion. A sea star eating a clam can\npartially open the shell, and then evert its stomach into the shell, introducing digestive enzymes into the interior of the mollusk.\nThis process can both weaken the strong adductor (closing) muscles of a bivalve and begin the process of digestion.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nExplore the sea star\u2019s body plan (http://openstax.org/l/sea_star) up close, watch one move across the sea floor, and see it devour\na mussel.\nBrittle stars belong to the class Ophiuroidea (\"snake-tails\"). Unlike sea stars, which have plump arms, brittle stars have long,\nthin, flexible arms that are sharply demarcated from the central disk. Brittle stars move by lashing out their arms or wrapping\nthem around objects and pulling themselves forward. Their arms are also used for grasping prey. The water vascular system in\nophiuroids is not used for locomotion.\nSea urchins and sand dollars are examples of Echinoidea (\"prickly\"). These echinoderms do not have arms, but are hemispherical\nor flattened with five rows of tube feet that extend through five rows of pores in a continuous internal shell called a test. Their\ntube feet are used to keep the body surface clean. Skeletal plates around the mouth are organized into a complex multipart\nfeeding structure called \"Aristotle's lantern.\" Most echinoids graze on algae, but some are suspension feeders, and others may\nfeed on small animals or organic detritus\u2014the fragmentary remains of plants or animals.\nSea lilies and feather stars are examples of Crinoidea. Sea lilies are sessile, with the body attached to a stalk, but the feather stars\ncan actively move about using leglike cirri that emerge from the aboral surface. Both types of crinoid are suspension feeders,\ncollecting small food organisms along the ambulacral grooves of their feather-like arms. The \"feathers\" consisted of branched\narms lined with tube feet. The tube feet are used to move captured food toward the mouth. There are only about 600 extant\nspecies of crinoids, but they were far more numerous and abundant in ancient oceans. Many crinoids are deep-water species,\nbut feather stars typically inhabit shallow areas, especially in substropical and tropical waters.\nSea cucumbers of class Holothuroidea exhibit an extended oral-aboral axis. These are the only echinoderms that demonstrate\n\u201cfunctional\u201d bilateral symmetry as adults, because the extended oral-aboral axis compels the animal to lie horizontally rather\nthan stand vertically. The tube feet are reduced or absent, except on the side on which the animal lies. They have a single gonad\nand the digestive tract is more typical of a bilaterally symmetrical animal. A pair of gill-like structures called respiratory trees\nbranch from the posterior gut; muscles around the cloaca pump water in and out of these trees. There are clusters of tentacles\naround the mouth. Some sea cucumbers feed on detritus, while others are suspension feeders, sifting out small organisms with\ntheir oral tentacles. Some species of sea cucumbers are unique among the echinoderms in that cells containing hemoglobin\n770\nChapter 28 \u2022 Invertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncirculate in the coelomic fluid, the water vascular system and/or the hemal system.\nFigure 28.48 Classes of echinoderms.

In some\ngroups, some of these traits are present only during embryonic development. In addition to containing vertebrate classes, the\nphylum Chordata contains two clades of \u201cinvertebrates\u201d: Urochordata (tunicates, salps, and larvaceans) and Cephalochordata\n(lancelets). Most tunicates live on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders. Lancelets are suspension feeders that feed on\nphytoplankton and other microorganisms.

SUMMARY\n28.1 Phylum Porifera\nAnimals included in phylum Porifera are parazoans because\nthey do not show the formation of true embryonically\nderived tissues, although they have a number of specific cell\ntypes and \u201cfunctional\u201d tissues such as pinacoderm. These\norganisms show very simple organization, with a\nrudimentary endoskeleton of spicules and spongin fibers.\nGlass sponge cells are connected together in a\nmultinucleated syncytium. Although sponges are very simple\nin organization, they perform most of the physiological\nfunctions typical of more complex animals.\n28.2 Phylum Cnidaria\nCnidarians represent a more complex level of organization\nthan Porifera. They possess outer and inner tissue layers that\nsandwich a noncellular mesoglea between them. Cnidarians\npossess a well-formed digestive system and carry out\nextracellular digestion in a digestive cavity that extends\nthrough much of the animal. The mouth is surrounded by\ntentacles that contain large numbers of\ncnidocytes\u2014specialized cells bearing nematocysts used for\nstinging and capturing prey as well as discouraging\npredators. Cnidarians have separate sexes and many have a\nlifecycle that involves two distinct morphological\nforms\u2014medusoid and polypoid\u2014at various stages in their\nlife cycles. In species with both forms, the medusa is the\nsexual, gamete-producing stage and the polyp is the asexual\nstage. Cnidarian species include individual or colonial\npolypoid forms, floating colonies, or large individual medusa\nforms (sea jellies).\n28.3 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa:\nFlatworms, Rotifers, and\nNemerteans\nThis section describes three phyla of relatively simple\ninvertebrates: one acoelomate, one pseudocoelomate, and\none eucoelomate. Flatworms are acoelomate, triploblastic\nanimals. They lack circulatory and respiratory systems, and\nhave a rudimentary excretory system. This digestive system\nis incomplete in most species, and absent in tapeworms.\nThere are four traditional groups of flatworms, the largely\nfree-living turbellarians, which include polycladid marine\nworms and tricladid freshwater species, the ectoparasitic\nmonogeneans, and the endoparasitic trematodes and\ncestodes. Trematodes have complex life cycles involving a\nmolluscan secondary host and a primary host in which\nsexual reproduction takes place. Cestodes, or tapeworms,\ninfect the digestive systems of their primary vertebrate\nhosts.\nRotifers are microscopic, multicellular, mostly aquatic\norganisms that are currently under taxonomic revision. The\ngroup is characterized by the ciliated, wheel-like corona,\nlocated on their head. Food collected by the corona is passed\nto another structure unique to this group of organisms\u2014the\nmastax or jawed pharynx.\nThe nemerteans are probably simple eucoelomates. These\nribbon-shaped animals also bear a specialized proboscis\nenclosed within a rhynchocoel. The development of a closed\ncirculatory system derived from the coelom is a significant\ndifference seen in this species compared to other phyla\ndescribed here. Alimentary, nervous, and excretory systems\nare more developed in the nemerteans than in the flatworms\nor rotifers. Embryonic development of nemertean worms\nproceeds via a planuliform or trochophore-like larval stage.\n28.4 Superphylum Lophotrochozoa:\nMolluscs and Annelids\nPhylum Mollusca is a large, group of protostome\nschizocoelous invertebrates that occupy marine, freshwater,\nand terrestrial habitats. Mollusks can be divided into seven\nclasses, each of which exhibits variations on the basic\nmolluscan body plan. Two defining features are the mantle,\nwhich secretes a protective calcareous shell in many species,\nand the radula, a rasping feeding organ found in most\nclasses. Some mollusks have evolved a reduced shell, and\nothers have no radula. The mantle also covers the body and\nforms a mantle cavity, which is quite distinct from the\ncoelomic cavity\u2014typically reduced to the area surrounding\nthe heart, kidneys, and intestine. In aquatic mollusks,\nrespiration is facilitated by gills (ctenidia) in the mantle\nChapter 28 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n773\ncavity. In terrestrial mollusks, the mantle cavity itself serves\nas an organ of gas exchange. Mollusks also have a muscular\nfoot, which is modified in various ways for locomotion or\nfood capture. Most mollusks have separate sexes. Early\ndevelopment in aquatic species occurs via one or more larval\nstages, including a trochophore larva, that precedes a veliger\nlarva in some groups.\nPhylum Annelida includes vermiform, segmented animals.\nSegmentation is metameric (i.e., each segment is partitioned\ninternally as well as externally, with various structures\nrepeated in each segment). These animals have well-\ndeveloped neuronal, circulatory, and digestive systems. The\ntwo major groups of annelids are the polychaetes, which\nhave parapodia with multiple bristles, and oligochaetes,\nwhich have no parapodia and fewer bristles or no bristles.\nOligochaetes, which include earthworms and leeches, have a\nspecialized band of segments known as a clitellum, which\nsecretes a cocoon and protects gametes during reproduction.\nThe leeches do not have full internal segmentation.\nReproductive strategies include separate sexes,\nhermaphroditism, and serial hermaphroditism. Polychaetes\ntypically have trochophore larvae, while the oligochaetes\ndevelop more directly.\n28.5 Superphylum Ecdysozoa:\nNematodes and Tardigrades\nThe defining feature of the Ecdysozoa is a collagenous/\nchitinous cuticle that covers the body, and the necessity to\nmolt the cuticle periodically during growth. Nematodes are\nroundworms, with a pseudocoel body cavity. They have a\ncomplete digestive system, a differentiated nervous system,\nand a rudimentory excretory system. The phylum includes\nfree-living species like Caenorhabditis elegans as well as\nmany species of endoparasitic organisms such as Ascaris\nspp. They include dioeceous as well as hermaphroditic\nspecies. Embryonic development proceeds via several larval\nstages, and most adults have a fixed number of cells.\nThe tardigrades, sometimes called \"water bears,\" are a\nwidespread group of tiny animals with a segmented cuticle\ncovering the epidermis and four pairs of clawed legs. Like the\nnematodes, they are pseudocoelomates and have a fixed\nnumber of cells as adults. Specialized proteins enable them\nto enter cryptobiosis, a kind of suspended animation during\nwhich they can resist a number of adverse environmental\nconditions.\n28.6 Superphylum Ecdysozoa:\nArthropods\nArthropods represent the most successful animal phylum on\nEarth, both in terms of the number of species and the\nnumber of individuals. As members of the Ecdysozoa, all\narthropods have a protective chitinous cuticle that must be\nperiodically molted and shed during development or growth.\nArthropods are characterized by a segmented body as well as\nthe presence of jointed appendages. In the basic body plan, a\npair of appendages is present per body segment. Within the\nphylum, traditional classification is based on mouthparts,\nbody subdivisions, number of appendages, and\nmodifications of appendages present. In aquatic arthropods,\nthe chitinous exoskeleton may be calcified. Gills, tracheae,\nand book lungs facilitate respiration. Unique larval stages\nare commonly seen in both aquatic and terrestrial groups of\narthropods.\n28.7 Superphylum Deuterostomia\nEchinoderms are deuterostome marine organisms, whose\nadults show five-fold symmetry. This phylum of animals has\na calcareous endoskeleton composed of ossicles, or body\nplates. Epidermal spines are attached to some ossicles and\nserve in a protective capacity. Echinoderms possess a water-\nvascular system that serves both for respiration and for\nlocomotion, although other respiratory structures such as\npapulae and respiratory trees are found in some species. A\nlarge aboral madreporite is the point of entry and exit for sea\nwater pumped into the water vascular system. Echinoderms\nhave a variety of feeding techniques ranging from predation\nto suspension feeding. Osmoregulation is carried out by\nspecialized cells known as podocytes associated with the\nhemal system.\nThe characteristic features of the Chordata are a notochord,\na dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, a post-anal tail,\nand an endostyle/thyroid that secretes iodinated hormones.\nThe phylum Chordata contains two clades of invertebrates:\nUrochordata (tunicates, salps, and larvaceans) and\nCephalochordata (lancelets), together with the vertebrates in\nthe Vertebrata. Most tunicates live on the ocean floor and are\nsuspension feeders. Lancelets are suspension feeders that\nfeed on phytoplankton and other microorganisms. The sister\ntaxon of the Chordates is the Ambulacraria, which includes\nboth the Echinoderms and the hemichordates, which share\npharyngeal slits with the chordates.\n774\nChapter 28 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

One of the first major steps was the emergence of the quadrupeds in the form of the\namphibians.

The vertebrate species now living represent\nonly a small portion of the vertebrates that have existed in the past. The best-known extinct vertebrates\nare the dinosaurs, a unique group of reptiles, some of which reached sizes not seen before or after in\nterrestrial animals. In fact, they were the dominant terrestrial animals for 150 million years, until most\nof them died out in a mass extinction near the end of the Cretaceous period (except for the feathered\ntheropod ancestors of modern birds, whose direct descendents now number nearly 10,000 species).\nAlthough it is not known with certainty what caused this mass extinction (not only of dinosaurs, but of\nmany other groups of organisms), a great deal is known about the anatomy of the dinosaurs and early\nbirds, given the preservation of numerous skeletal elements, nests, eggs, and embryos in the fossil\nrecord.\nChapter Outline\n29.1 Chordates\n29.2 Fishes\n29.3 Amphibians\n29.4 Reptiles\n29.5 Birds\n29.6 Mammals\n29.7 The Evolution of\nPrimates\nand seeds in plants, freed terrestrial animals from their dependence on water for fertilization and\nembryonic development. Within the amniotes, modifications of keratinous epidermal structures have given\nrise to scales, claws, hair, and feathers. The scales of reptiles sealed their skins against water loss, while hair\nand feathers provided insulation to support the evolution of endothermy, as well as served other functions\nsuch as camouflage and mate attraction in the vertebrate lineages that led to birds and mammals.\nCurrently, a number of vertebrate species face extinction primarily due to habitat loss and pollution.\nAccording to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, more than 6,000 vertebrate species are\nclassified as threatened. Amphibians and mammals are the classes with the greatest percentage of\nthreatened species, with 29 percent of all amphibians and 21 percent of all mammals classified as\nthreatened. Attempts are being made around the world to prevent the extinction of threatened species. For\nexample, the Biodiversity Action Plan is an international program, ratified by 188 countries, which is\ndesigned to protect species and habitats.\nVertebrates are members of the kingdom Animalia and the phylum Chordata (Figure 29.2). Recall that\nanimals that possess bilateral symmetry can be divided into two groups\u2014protostomes and\ndeuterostomes\u2014based on their patterns of embryonic development. The deuterostomes, whose name\ntranslates as \u201csecond mouth,\u201d consist of two major phyla: Echinodermata and Chordata. Echinoderms are\ninvertebrate marine animals that have pentaradial symmetry and a spiny body covering, a group that\nincludes sea stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. The most conspicuous and familiar members of\nChordata are vertebrates, but this phylum also includes two groups of invertebrate chordates.\nFigure 29.2 Deuterostome phylogeny. All chordates are deuterostomes possessing a notochord at some stage of their\nlife cycle.\nCharacteristics of Chordata\nAnimals in the phylum Chordata share five key chacteristics that appear at some stage during their\ndevelopment: a notochord, a dorsal hollow (tubular) nerve cord, pharyngeal gill arches or slits, a post-anal\ntail, and an endostyle/thyroid gland (Figure 29.3). In some groups, some of these key chacteristics are\npresent only during embryonic development.\nThe chordates are named for the notochord, which is a flexible, rod-shaped mesodermal structure that is\nfound in the embryonic stage of all chordates and in the adult stage of some chordate species. It is\n780\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nstrengthened with glycoproteins similar to cartilage and covered with a collagenous sheath. The notocord is located between the\ndigestive tube and the nerve cord, and provides rigid skeletal support as well as a flexible location for attachment of axial\nmuscles. In some chordates, the notochord acts as the primary axial support of the body throughout the animal\u2019s lifetime.\nHowever, in vertebrates (craniates), the notochord is present only during embryonic development, at which time it induces the\ndevelopment of the neural tube and serves as a support for the developing embryonic body. The notochord, however, is not\nfound in the postembryonic stages of vertebrates; at this point, it has been replaced by the vertebral column (that is, the spine).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 29.3 Chordate features. In chordates, four common features appear at some point during development: a notochord, a dorsal\nhollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. The endostyle is embedded in the floor of the pharynx.\nWhich of the following statements about common features of chordates is true?\n1.\nThe dorsal hollow nerve cord is part of the chordate central nervous system.\n2.\nIn vertebrate fishes, the pharyngeal slits become the gills.\n3.\nHumans are not chordates because humans do not have a tail.\n4.\nVertebrates do not have a notochord at any point in their development; instead, they have a vertebral column.\n5.\nThe endostyle secretes steroid hormones.\nThe dorsal hollow nerve cord is derived from ectoderm that rolls into a hollow tube during development. In chordates, it is\nlocated dorsally to the notochord. In contrast, the nervous system in protostome animal phyla is characterized by solid nerve\ncords that are located either ventrally and/or laterally to the gut. In vertebrates, the neural tube develops into the brain and\nspinal cord, which together comprise the central nervous system (CNS). The peripheral nervous system (PNS) refers to the\nperipheral nerves (including the cranial nerves) lying outside of the brain and spinal cord.\nPharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx (the region just posterior to the mouth) that extend to the outside environment. In\norganisms that live in aquatic environments, pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding.\nSome invertebrate chordates use the pharyngeal slits to filter food out of the water that enters the mouth. The endostyle is a\nstrip of ciliated mucus-producing tissue in the floor of the pharynx. Food particles trapped in the mucus are moved along the\nendostyle toward the gut. The endostyle also produces substances similar to thyroid hormones and is homologous with the\nthyroid gland in vertebrates. In vertebrate fishes, the pharyngeal slits are modified into gill supports, and in jawed fishes, into\njaw supports. In tetrapods (land vertebrates), the slits are highly modified into components of the ear, and tonsils and thymus\nglands. In other vertebrates, pharyngeal arches, derived from all three germ layers, give rise to the oral jaw from the first\npharyngeal arch, with the second arch becoming the hyoid and jaw support.\nThe post-anal tail is a posterior elongation of the body, extending beyond the anus. The tail contains skeletal elements and\nmuscles, which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species, such as fishes. In some terrestrial vertebrates, the tail also\nhelps with balance, courting, and signaling when danger is near. In humans and other great apes, the post-anal tail is reduced\nto a vestigial coccyx (\u201ctail bone\u201d) that aids in balance during sitting.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick for a video discussing the evolution of chordates and five characteristics that they share.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/chordate_evol)\n29.1 \u2022 Chordates\n781\nChordates and the Evolution of Vertebrates\nTwo clades of chordates are invertebrates: Cephalochordata and Urochordata. Members of these groups also possess the five\ndistinctive features of chordates at some point during their development.\nCephalochordata\nMembers of Cephalochordata possess a notochord, dorsal hollow tubular nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, endostyle/thyroid gland,\nand a post-anal tail in the adult stage (Figure 29.4). The notochord extends into the head, which gives the subphylum its name.\nAlthough the neural tube also extends into the head region, there is no well-defined brain, and the nervous system is centered\naround a hollow nerve cord lying above the notochord. Extinct members of this subphylum include Pikaia, which is the oldest\nknown cephalochordate. Excellently preserved Pikaia fossils were recovered from the Burgess shales of Canada and date to the\nmiddle of the Cambrian age, making them more than 500 million years old. Its anatomy of Pikaia closely resembles that of the\nextant lancelet in the genus Branchiostoma.\nThe lancelets are named for their bladelike shape. Lancelets are only a few centimeters long and are usually found buried in sand\nat the bottom of warm temperate and tropical seas. Cephalochordates are suspension feeders. A water current is created by cilia\nin the mouth, and is filtered through oral tentacles. Water from the mouth then enters the pharyngeal slits, which filter out food\nparticles. The filtered water collects in a gill chamber called the atrium and exits through the atriopore. Trapped food particles\nare caught in a stream of mucus produced by the endostyle in a ventral ciliated fold (or groove) of the pharynx and carried to the\ngut. Most gas exchange occurs across the body surface. Sexes are separate and gametes are released into the water through the\natriopore for external fertilization.\nFigure 29.4 Cephalochordate anatomy. In the lancelet and other cephalochordates, the notochord extends into the head region. Adult\nlancelets retain all five key characteristics of chordates: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, an endostyle, and a post-\nanal tail.\nUrochordata\nThe 1,600 species of Urochordata are also known as tunicates (Figure 29.5). The name tunicate derives from the cellulose-like\ncarbohydrate material, called the tunic, which covers the outer body of tunicates. Although tunicates are classified as chordates,\nthe adults do not have a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, or a post-anal tail, although they do have pharyngeal slits and an\nendostyle. The \u201ctadpole\u201d larval form, however, possesses all five structures. Most tunicates are hermaphrodites; their larvae\nhatch from eggs inside the adult tunicate\u2019s body. After hatching, a tunicate larva (possessing all five chordate features) swims for\na few days until it finds a suitable surface on which it can attach, usually in a dark or shaded location. It then attaches via the\nhead to the surface and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form, at which point the notochord, nerve cord, and tail\ndisappear, leaving the pharyngeal gill slits and the endostyle as the two remaining features of its chordate morphology.\n782\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 29.5 Urochordate anatomy. (a) This photograph shows a colony of the tunicate Botrylloides violaceus. (b) The larval stage of the\ntunicate possesses all of the features characteristic of chordates: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, an endostyle,\nand a post-anal tail. (c) In the adult stage, the notochord, nerve cord, and tail disappear, leaving just the pharyngeal slits and endostyle.\n(credit: modification of work by Dann Blackwood, USGS)\nAdult tunicates may be either solitary or colonial forms, and some species may reproduce by budding. Most tunicates live a\nsessile existence on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders. However, chains of thaliacean tunicates called salps (Figure 29.6)\ncan swim actively while feeding, propelling themselves as they move water through the pharyngeal slits. The primary foods of\ntunicates are plankton and detritus. Seawater enters the tunicate\u2019s body through its incurrent siphon. Suspended material is\nfiltered out of this water by a mucous net produced by the endostyle and is passed into the intestine via the action of cilia. The\nanus empties into the excurrent siphon, which expels wastes and water. Tunicates are found in shallow ocean waters around the\nworld.\nFigure 29.6 Salps. These colonial tunicates feed on phytoplankton. Salps are sequential hermaphrodites, with younger female colonies\nfertilized by older male colonies.

Most\nbilaterally symmetrical animals have a head; of these, those that have a cranium comprise the clade Craniata/Vertebrata, which\nincludes the primitively jawless Myxini (hagfishes), Petromyzontida (lampreys), and all of the organisms called \u201cvertebrates.\u201d\n(We should note that the Myxini have a cranium but lack a backbone.)\n29.1 \u2022 Chordates\n783\nFigure 29.7 A craniate skull. The subphylum Craniata (or Vertebrata), including this placoderm fish (Dunkleosteus sp.), are characterized\nby the presence of a cranium, mandible, and other facial bones. (credit: \u201cSteveoc 86\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nMembers of the phylum Craniata/Vertebrata display the five characteristic features of the chordates; however, members of this\ngroup also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from invertebrate chordates. Vertebrates are named for the\nvertebral column, composed of vertebrae\u2014a series of separate, irregularly shaped bones joined together to form a backbone\n(Figure 29.8). Initially, the vertebrae form in segments around the embryonic notochord, but eventually replace it in adults. In\nmost derived vertebrates, the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs that cushion and support\nadjacent vertebrae.\nFigure 29.8 A vertebrate skeleton. Vertebrata are characterized by the presence of a backbone, such as the one that runs through the\nmiddle of this fish. All vertebrates are in the Craniata clade and have a cranium. (credit: Ernest V. More; taken at Smithsonian Museum of\nNatural History, Washington, D.C.)\nThe relationship of the vertebrates to the invertebrate chordates has been a matter of contention, but although these cladistic\nrelationships are still being examined, it appears that the Craniata/Vertebrata are a monophyletic group that shares the five\nbasic chordate characteristics with the other two subphyla, Urochordata and Cephalochordata. Traditional phylogenies place\nthe cephalochordates as a sister clade to the chordates, a view that has been supported by most current molecular analyses. This\nhypothesis is further supported by the discovery of a fossil in China from the genus Haikouella. This organism seems to be an\nintermediate form between cephalochordates and vertebrates. The Haikouella fossils are about 530 million years old and appear\nsimilar to modern lancelets. These organisms had a brain and eyes, as do vertebrates, but lack the skull found in craniates.1 This\nevidence suggests that vertebrates arose during the Cambrian explosion.\nVertebrates are the largest group of chordates, with more than 62,000 living species, which are grouped based on anatomical\nand physiological traits. More than one classification and naming scheme is used for these animals. Here we will consider the\ntraditional groups Agnatha, Chondrichthyes, Osteichthyes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia, which constitute classes\nin the subphylum Vertebrata/Craniata. Virtually all modern cladists classify birds within Reptilia, which correctly reflects their\n1Chen, J. Y., Huang, D. Y., and Li, C.

Thus, we now have the nonavian reptiles and the avian reptiles in our reptilian classification. We consider\nthem separately only for convenience. Further, we will consider hagfishes and lampreys together as jawless fishes, the Agnatha,\nalthough emerging classification schemes separate them into chordate jawless fishes (the hagfishes) and vertebrate jawless\nfishes (the lampreys).\nAnimals that possess jaws are known as gnathostomes, which means \u201cjawed mouth.\u201d Gnathostomes include fishes and\ntetrapods. Tetrapod literally means \u201cfour-footed,\u201d which refers to the phylogenetic history of various land vertebrates, even\nthough in some of the tetrapods, the limbs may have been modified for purposes other than walking. Tetrapods include\namphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, and technically could also refer to the extinct fishlike groups that gave rise to the\ntetrapods. Tetrapods can be further divided into two groups: amphibians and amniotes. Amniotes are animals whose eggs\ncontain four extraembryonic membranes (yolk sac, amnion, chorion, and allantois) that provide nutrition and a water-retaining\nenvironment for their embryos. Amniotes are adapted for terrestrial living, and include mammals, reptiles, and birds.\n29.2 Fishes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the difference between jawless and jawed fishes\n\u2022\nDiscuss the distinguishing features of sharks and rays compared to other modern fishes\nModern fishes include an estimated 31,000 species, by far the most of all clades within the Vertebrata. Fishes were the earliest\nvertebrates, with jawless species being the earliest forms and jawed species evolving later. They are active feeders, rather than\nsessile, suspension feeders. The Agnatha (jawless fishes)\u2014the hagfishes and lampreys\u2014have a distinct cranium and complex\nsense organs including eyes, that distinguish them from the invertebrate chordates, the urochordates and cephalochordates.\nJawless Fishes: Superclass Agnatha\nJawless fishes (Agnatha) are craniates representing an ancient vertebrate lineage that arose over 550 million years ago. In the\npast, hagfishes and lampreys were sometimes recognized as separate clades within the Agnatha, primarily because lampreys\nwere regarded as true vertebrates, whereas hagfishes were not. However, recent molecular data, both from rRNA and mtDNA,\nas well as embryological data, provide strong support for the hypothesis that living agnathans\u2014previously called\ncyclostomes\u2014are monophyletic, and thus share recent common ancestry. The discussion below, for convenience, separates the\nmodern \u201ccyclostomes\u201d into the class Myxini and class Petromyzontida. The defining features of the living jawless fishes are the\nlack of jaws and lack of paired lateral appendages (fins). They also lack internal ossification and scales, although these are not\ndefining features of the clade.\nSome of the earliest jawless fishes were the armored ostracoderms (which translates to \u201cshell-skin\u201d): vertebrate fishes encased in\nbony armor\u2014unlike present-day jawless fishes, which lack bone in their scales. Some ostracoderms, also unlike living jawless\nfishes, may have had paired fins. We should note, however, that the \u201costracoderms\u201d represent an assemblage of heavily armored\nextinct jawless fishes that may not form a natural evolutionary group. Fossils of the genus Haikouichthys from China, with an\nage of about 530 million years, show many typical vertebrate characteristics including paired eyes, auditory capsules, and\nrudimentary vertebrae.\nClass Myxini: Hagfishes\nThe class Myxini includes at least 70 species of hagfishes\u2014eel-like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on living or\ndead invertebrates, fishes, and marine mammals (Figure 29.9). Although they are almost completely blind, sensory barbels\naround the mouth help them locate food by smell and touch. They feed using keratinized teeth on a movable cartilaginous plate\nin the mouth, which rasp pieces of flesh from their prey. These feeding structures allow the gills to be used exclusively for\nrespiration, not for filter feeding as in the urochordates and cephalochordates. Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in\noceans around the world, except for the polar regions. Unique slime glands beneath the skin release a milky mucus (through\nsurface pores) that upon contact with water becomes incredibly slippery, making the animal almost impossible to hold. This\nslippery mucus thus allows the hagfish to escape from the grip of predators. Hagfish can also twist their bodies into a knot,\nwhich provides additional leverage to feed. Sometimes hagfish enter the bodies of dead animals and eat carcasses from the\ninside out! Interestingly, they do not have a stomach!\n29.2 \u2022 Fishes\n785\nFigure 29.9 Hagfish. Pacific hagfish are scavengers that live on the ocean floor. (credit: Linda Snook, NOAA/CBNMS)\nHagfishes have a cartilaginous skull, as well as a fibrous and cartilaginous skeleton, but the major supportive structure is the\nnotochord that runs the length of the body. In hagfishes, the notochord is not replaced by the vertebral column, as it is in true\nvertebrates, and thus they may (morphologically) represent a sister group to the true vertebrates, making them the most basal\nclade among the skull-bearing chordates.\nClass Petromyzontida: Lampreys\nThe class Petromyzontida includes approximately 40 species of lampreys, which are superficially similar to hagfishes in size and\nshape. However, lampreys possess extrinsic eye muscles, at least two semicircular canals, and a true cerebellum, as well as\nsimple vertebral elements, called arcualia\u2014cartilaginous structures arranged above the notochord. These features are also\nshared with the gnathostomes\u2014vertebrates with jawed mouths and paired appendages (see below). Lampreys also have a dorsal\ntubular nerve cord with a well-differentiated brain, a small cerebellum, and 10 pairs of nerves. The classification of lampreys is\nstill debated, but they clearly represent one of the oldest divergences of the vertebrate lineage. Lampreys lack paired\nappendages, as do the hagfishes, although they have one or two fleshy dorsal fins. As adults, lampreys are characterized by a\nrasping tongue within a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. Many species have a parasitic stage of their life cycle during which\nthey are fish ectoparasites (some call them predators because they attack and eventually fall off) (Figure 29.10).\nFigure 29.10 Lamprey. These parasitic sea lampreys, Petromyzon marinus, attach by suction to their lake trout host, and use their rough\ntongues to rasp away flesh in order to feed on the trout\u2019s blood. (credit: USGS)\nLampreys live primarily in coastal and freshwater environments, and have a worldwide distribution, except for the tropics and\npolar regions. Some species are marine, but all species spawn in fresh water. Interestingly, northern lampreys in the family\nPetromyzontidae, have the highest number of chromosomes (164 to 174) among the vertebrates. Eggs are fertilized externally,\nand the larvae (called ammocoetes) differ greatly from the adult form, closely resembling the adult cephalocordate amphioxus.\nAfter spending three to 15 years as suspension feeders in rivers and streams, they attain sexual maturity. Shortly afterward, the\nadults swim upstream, reproduce, and die within days.\n786\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nGnathostomes: Jawed Fishes\nGnathostomes, or \u201cjaw-mouths,\u201d are vertebrates that possess true jaws\u2014a milestone in the evolution of the vertebrates. In fact,\none of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development of the jaw: a hinged structure\nattached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food. Jaws were probably derived from the first pair of gill\narches supporting the gills of jawless fishes.\nEarly gnathostomes also possessed two sets of paired fins, allowing the fishes to maneuver accurately. Pectoral fins are typically\nlocated on the anterior body, and pelvic fins on the posterior. Evolution of the jaw and paired fins permitted gnathostomes to\nexpand their food options from the scavenging and suspension feeding of jawless fishes to active predation. The ability of\ngnathostomes to exploit new nutrient sources probably contributed to their replacing most jawless fishes during the Devonian\nperiod. Two early groups of gnathostomes were the acanthodians and placoderms (Figure 29.11), which arose in the late Silurian\nperiod and are now extinct. Most modern fishes are gnathostomes that belong to the clades Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes\n(which include the class Actinoptertygii and class Sarcopterygii).\nFigure 29.11 A placoderm. Dunkleosteus was an enormous placoderm from the Devonian period, 380 to 360 million years ago. It\nmeasured up to 10 meters in length and weighed up to 3.6 tons. Its head and neck were armored with heavy bony plates. Although\nDunkleosteus had no true teeth, the edge of the jaw was armed with sharp bony blades. (credit: Nobu Tamura)\nClass Chondrichthyes: Cartilaginous Fishes\nThe class Chondrichthyes (about 1,000 species) is a morphologically diverse clade, consisting of subclass Elasmobranchii (sharks\n[Figure 29.12], rays, and skates, together with the obscure and critically endangered sawfishes), and a few dozen species of\nfishes called chimaeras, or \u201cghost sharks\u201d in the subclass Holocephali. Chondrichthyes are jawed fishes that possess paired fins\nand a skeleton made of cartilage. This clade arose approximately 370 million years ago in the early or middle Devonian. They are\nthought to be descended from the placoderms, which had endoskeletons made of bone; thus, the lighter cartilaginous skeleton\nof Chondrichthyes is a secondarily derived evolutionary development. Parts of shark skeleton are strengthened by granules of\ncalcium carbonate, but this is not the same as bone.\nMost cartilaginous fishes live in marine habitats, with a few species living in fresh water for a part or all of their lives. Most\nsharks are carnivores that feed on live prey, either swallowing it whole or using their jaws and teeth to tear it into smaller pieces.\nSharks have abrasive skin covered with tooth-like scales called placoid scales. Shark teeth probably evolved from rows of these\nscales lining the mouth. A few species of sharks and rays, like the enormous whale shark (Figure 29.13), are suspension feeders\nthat feed on plankton. The sawfishes have an extended rostrum that looks like a double-edged saw. The rostrum is covered with\nelectrosensitive pores that allow the sawfish to detect slight movements of prey hiding in the muddy sea floor. The teeth in the\nrostrum are actually modified tooth-like structures called denticles, similar to scales.\n29.2 \u2022 Fishes\n787\nFigure 29.12 Shark. Hammerhead sharks tend to school during the day and hunt prey at night. (credit: Masashi Sugawara)\nSharks have well-developed sense organs that aid them in locating prey, including a keen sense of smell and the ability to detect\nelectromagnetic fields. Electroreceptors called ampullae of Lorenzini allow sharks to detect the electromagnetic fields that are\nproduced by all living things, including their prey. (Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals\nand sharks have perhaps the most sensitive electroreceptors of any animal.) Sharks, together with most fishes and aquatic and\nlarval amphibians, also have a row of sensory structures called the lateral line, which is used to detect movement and vibration\nin the surrounding water, and is often considered to be functionally similar to the sense of \u201chearing\u201d in terrestrial vertebrates.\nThe lateral line is visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of a fish\u2019s body. Sharks have no mechanism for maintaining\nneutral buoyancy and must swim continuously to stay suspended in the water. Some must also swim in order to ventilate their\ngills but others have muscular pumps in their mouths to keep water flowing over the gills.\nFigure 29.13 Whale shark in the Georgia Aquarium. Whale sharks are filter-feeders and can grow to be over 10 meters long. Whale sharks,\nlike most other sharks, are ovoviviparous.

Most species are ovoviviparous: The fertilized egg is retained in the\noviduct of the mother\u2019s body and the embryo is nourished by the egg yolk. The eggs hatch in the uterus, and young are born alive\nand fully functional. Some species of sharks are oviparous: They lay eggs that hatch outside of the mother\u2019s body. Embryos are\nprotected by a shark egg case or \u201cmermaid\u2019s purse\u201d (Figure 29.14) that has the consistency of leather. The shark egg case has\ntentacles that snag in seaweed and give the newborn shark cover. A few species of sharks, e.g., tiger sharks and hammerheads,\nare viviparous: the yolk sac that initially contains the egg yolk and transfers its nutrients to the growing embryo becomes\nattached to the oviduct of the female, and nutrients are transferred directly from the mother to the growing embryo. In both\nviviparous and ovoviviparous sharks, gas exchange uses this yolk sac transport.\n788\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 29.14 Shark egg cases.

(credit: Jek Bacarisas)\nIn general, the Chondrichthyes have a fusiform or dorsoventrally flattened body, a heterocercal caudal fin or tail (unequally sized\nfin lobes, with the tail vertebrae extending into the larger upper lobe) paired pectoral and pelvic fins (in males these may be\nmodified as claspers), exposed gill slits (elasmobranch), and an intestine with a spiral valve that condenses the length of the\nintestine. They also have three pairs of semicircular canals, and excellent senses of smell, vibration, vision, and electroreception.\nA very large lobed liver produces squalene oil (a lightweight biochemical precursor to steroids) that serves to aid in buoyancy\n(because with a specific gravity of 0.855, it is lighter than that of water).\nRays and skates comprise more than 500 species. They are closely related to sharks but can be distinguished from sharks by their\nflattened bodies, pectoral fins that are enlarged and fused to the head, and gill slits on their ventral surface (Figure 29.15). Like\nsharks, rays and skates have a cartilaginous skeleton. Most species are marine and live on the sea floor, with nearly a worldwide\ndistribution.\nUnlike the stereotypical sharks and rays, the Holocephali (chimaeras or ratfish) have a diphycercal tail (equally sized fin lobes,\nwith the tail vertebrae located between them), lack scales (lost secondarily in evolution), and have teeth modified as grinding\nplates that are used to feed on mollusks and other invertebrates (Figure 29.15b). Unlike sharks with elasmobranch or naked gills,\nchimaeras have four pairs of gills covered by an operculum. Many species have a pearly iridescence and are extremely pretty.\nFigure 29.15 Cartilaginous fish. (a) Stingray. This stingray blends into the sandy bottom of the ocean floor.

The vast majority of present-\nday fishes belong to this group, which consists of approximately 30,000 species, making it the largest class of vertebrates in\nexistence today.\nNearly all bony fishes have an ossified skeleton with specialized bone cells (osteocytes) that produce and maintain a calcium\nphosphate matrix. This characteristic has been reversed only in a few groups of Osteichthyes, such as sturgeons and paddlefish,\n29.2 \u2022 Fishes\n789\nwhich have primarily cartilaginous skeletons. The skin of bony fishes is often covered by overlapping scales, and glands in the\nskin secrete mucus that reduces drag when swimming and aids the fish in osmoregulation. Like sharks, bony fishes have a\nlateral line system that detects vibrations in water.\nAll bony fishes use gills to breathe. Water is drawn over gills that are located in chambers covered and ventilated by a protective,\nmuscular flap called the operculum. Many bony fishes also have a swim bladder, a gas-filled organ derived as a pouch from the\ngut. The swim bladder helps to control the buoyancy of the fish. In most bony fish, the gases of the swim bladder are exchanged\ndirectly with the blood. The swim bladder is believed to be homologous to the lungs of lungfish and the lungs of land vertebrates.\nBony fishes are further divided into two extant clades: Class Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) and Class Sarcopterygii (lobe-\nfinned fishes).\nActinopterygii (Figure 29.16a), the ray-finned fishes, include many familiar fishes\u2014tuna, bass, trout, and salmon among\nothers\u2014and represent about half of all vertebrate species. Ray-finned fishes are named for the fan of slender bones that\nsupports their fins.\nIn contrast, the fins of Sarcopterygii (Figure 29.16b) are fleshy and lobed, supported by bones that are similar in type and\narrangement to the bones in the limbs of early tetrapods. The few extant members of this clade include several species of\nlungfishes and the less familiar coelacanths, which were thought to be extinct until living specimens were discovered between\nAfrica and Madagascar. Currently, two species of coelocanths have been described.\nFigure 29.16 Osteichthyes. The (a) sockeye salmon and (b) coelacanth are both bony fishes of the Osteichthyes clade. The coelacanth,\nsometimes called a lobe-finned fish, was thought to have gone extinct in the Late Cretaceous period, 100 million years ago, until one was\ndiscovered in 1938 near the Comoros Islands between Africa and Madagascar.

In fact, they cannot stray far\nfrom water because their reproduction is intimately tied to aqueous environments. Amphibians evolved during the Devonian\nperiod and were the earliest terrestrial tetrapods. They represent an evolutionary transition from water to land that occurred\nover many millions of years. Thus, the Amphibia are the only living true vertebrates that have made a transition from water to\nland in both their ontogeny (life development) and phylogeny (evolution). They have not changed much in morphology over the\npast 350 million years!\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this series of five Animal Planet videos on tetrapod evolution:\n\u2022\n1: The evolution from fish to earliest tetrapod\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/tetrapod_evol1)\n\u2022\n2: Fish to Earliest Tetrapod\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/tetrapod_evol2)\n\u2022\n3: The discovery of coelacanth and Acanthostega fossils\n790\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/tetrapod_evol3)\n\u2022\n4: The number of fingers on \u201clegs\u201d\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/tetrapod_evol4)\n\u2022\n5: Reconstructing the environment of early tetrapods\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/tetrapod_evol5)\nCharacteristics of Amphibians\nAs tetrapods, most amphibians are characterized by four well-developed limbs. In some species of salamanders, hindlimbs are\nreduced or absent, but all caecilians are (secondarily) limbless. An important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist,\npermeable skin that is achieved via mucus glands. Most water is taken in across the skin rather than by drinking. The skin is also\none of three respiratory surfaces used by amphibians. The other two are the lungs and the buccal (mouth) cavity. Air is taken first\ninto the mouth through the nostrils, and then pushed by positive pressure into the lungs by elevating the throat and closing the\nnostrils.\nAll extant adult amphibians are carnivorous, and some terrestrial amphibians have a sticky tongue used to capture prey.\nAmphibians also have multiple small teeth at the edge of the jaws. In salamanders and caecilians, teeth are present in both jaws,\nsometimes in multiple rows. In frogs and toads, teeth are seen only in the upper jaw. Additional teeth, called vomerine teeth,\nmay be found in the roof of the mouth. Amphibian teeth are pedicellate, which means that the root and crown are calcified,\nseparated by a zone of noncalcified tissue.\nAmphibians have image-forming eyes and color vision. Ears are best developed in frogs and toads, which vocalize to\ncommunicate. Frogs use separate regions of the inner ear for detecting higher and lower sounds: the papilla amphibiorum,\nwhich is sensitive to frequencies below 10,000 hertz and unique to amphibians, and the papilla basilaris, which is sensitive to\nhigher frequencies, including mating calls, transmitted from the eardrum through the stapes bone. Amphibians also have an\nextra bone in the ear, the operculum, which transmits low-frequency vibrations from the forelimbs and shoulders to the inner\near, and may be used for the detection of seismic signals.\nEvolution of Amphibians\nThe fossil record provides evidence of the first tetrapods: now-extinct amphibian species dating to nearly 400 million years ago.\nEvolution of tetrapods from lobe-finned freshwater fishes (similar to coelacanths and lungfish) represented a significant change\nin body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water, to organisms that breathed air and moved onto\nland; these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years during the Devonian period.\nAquatic tetrapods of the Devonian period include Ichthyostega and Acanthostega. Both were aquatic, and may have had both\ngills and lungs. They also had four limbs, with the skeletal structure of limbs found in present-day tetrapods, including\namphibians. However, the limbs could not be pulled in under the body and would not have supported their bodies well out of\nwater. They probably lived in shallow freshwater environments, and may have taken brief terrestrial excursions, much like\n\u201cwalking\u201d catfish do today in Florida. In Ichthyostega, the forelimbs were more developed than the hind limbs, so it might have\ndragged itself along when it ventured onto land. What preceded Acanthostega and Ichthyostega?\nIn 2006, researchers published news of their discovery of a fossil of a \u201ctetrapod-like fish,\u201d Tiktaalik roseae, which seems to be a\nmorphologically \u201cintermediate form\u201d between sarcopterygian fishes having feet-like fins and early tetrapods having true limbs\n(Figure 29.17). Tiktaalik likely lived in a shallow water environment about 375 million years ago.2 Tiktaalik also had gills and\nlungs, but the loss of some gill elements gave it a neck, which would have allowed its head to move sideways for feeding. The eyes\nwere on top of the head. It had fins, but the attachment of the fin bones to the shoulder suggested they might be weight-\nbearing. Tiktaalik preceded Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, with their four limbs, by about 10 million years and is considered to\nbe a true intermediate clade between fish and amphibians.\n2Daeschler, E.

The recent fossil discovery of Tiktaalik roseae suggests evidence for an animal intermediate to finned fish and\nlegged tetrapods, sometimes called a \"fishapod.\" (credit: Zina Deretsky, National Science Foundation)\nThe early tetrapods that moved onto land had access to new nutrient sources and relatively few predators. This led to the\nwidespread distribution of tetrapods during the early Carboniferous period, a period sometimes called the \u201cage of the\namphibians.\u201d\nModern Amphibians\nAmphibia comprises an estimated 6,770 extant species that inhabit tropical and temperate regions around the world. All living\nspecies are classified in the subclass Lissamphibia (\"smooth-amphibian\"), which is divided into three clades: Urodela (\u201ctailed\u201d),\nthe salamanders; Anura (\u201ctail-less\u201d), the frogs; and Apoda (\u201clegless ones\u201d), the caecilians.\nUrodela: Salamanders\nSalamanders are amphibians that belong to the order Urodela (or Caudata). These animals are probably the most similar to\nancestral amphibians. Living salamanders (Figure 29.18) include approximately 620 species, some of which are aquatic, others\nterrestrial, and some that live on land only as adults. Most adult salamanders have a generalized tetrapod body plan with four\nlimbs and a tail. The placement of their legs makes it difficult to lift their bodies off the ground and they move by bending their\nbodies from side to side, called lateral undulation, in a fish-like manner while \u201cwalking\u201d their arms and legs fore-and-aft. It is\nthought that their gait is similar to that used by early tetrapods. The majority of salamanders are lungless, and respiration\noccurs through the skin or through external gills in aquatic species. Some terrestrial salamanders have primitive lungs; a few\nspecies have both gills and lungs. The giant Japanese salamander, the largest living amphibian, has additional folds in its skin\nthat enlarge its respiratory surface.\nMost salamanders reproduce using an unusual process of internal fertilization of the eggs. Mating between salamanders\ntypically involves an elaborate and often prolonged courtship. Such a courtship ends in the deposition of sperm by the males in a\npacket called a spermatophore, which is subsequently picked up by the female, thus ultimately fertilization is internal. All\nsalamanders except one, the fire salamander, are oviparous. Aquatic salamanders lay their eggs in water, where they develop\ninto legless larvae called efts. Terrestrial salamanders lay their eggs in damp nests, where the eggs are guarded by their mothers.\nThese embryos go through the larval stage and complete metamorphosis before hatching into tiny adult forms. One aquatic\nsalamander, the Mexican axolotl, never leaves the larval stage, becoming sexually mature without metamorphosis.\n792\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 29.18 Salamander.

Anurans are among the most diverse\ngroups of vertebrates, with approximately 5,965 species that occur on all of the continents except Antarctica. Anurans, ranging\nfrom the minute New Guinea frog at 7 mm to the huge goliath frog at 32 cm from tropical Africa, have a body plan that is more\nspecialized for movement. Adult frogs use their hind limbs and their arrow-like endoskeleton to jump accurately to capture prey\non land. Tree frogs have hands adapted for grasping branches as they climb. In tropical areas, \u201cflying frogs\u201d can glide from perch\nto perch on the extended webs of their feet. Frogs have a number of modifications that allow them to avoid predators, including\nskin that acts as camouflage. Many species of frogs and salamanders also release defensive chemicals that are poisonous to\npredators from glands in the skin. Frogs with more toxic skins have bright warning (aposematic) coloration.\nFigure 29.19 Tree frog. The Australian green tree frog is a nocturnal predator that lives in the canopies of trees near a water source.\nFrog eggs are fertilized externally, and like other amphibians, frogs generally lay their eggs in moist environments. Although\namphibian eggs are protected by a thick jelly layer, they would still dehydrate quickly in a dry environment. Frogs demonstrate a\ngreat diversity of parental behaviors, with some species laying many eggs and exhibiting little parental care, to species that carry\neggs and tadpoles on their hind legs or embedded in their backs. The males of Darwin's frog carry tadpoles in their vocal sac.\nMany tree frogs lay their eggs off the ground in a folded leaf located over water so that the tadpoles can drop into the water as\nthey hatch.\nThe life cycle of most frogs, as other amphibians, consists of two distinct stages: the larval stage followed by metamorphosis to\nan adult stage. However, the eggs of frogs in the genus Eleutherodactylus develop directly into little froglets, guarded by a\nparent. The larval stage of a frog, the tadpole, is often a filter-feeding herbivore. Tadpoles usually have gills, a lateral line system,\n29.3 \u2022 Amphibians\n793\nlongfinned tails, and lack limbs. At the end of the tadpole stage, frogs undergo metamorphosis into the adult form (Figure\n29.20). During this stage, the gills, tail, and lateral line system disappear, and four limbs develop. The jaws become larger and\nare suited for carnivorous feeding, and the digestive system transforms into the typical short gut of a predator. An eardrum and\nair-breathing lungs also develop. These changes during metamorphosis allow the larvae to move onto land in the adult stage.\nFigure 29.20 Amphibian metapmorphosis. A juvenile frog metamorphoses into a frog. Here, the frog has started to develop limbs, but its\ntadpole tail is still evident.\nApoda: Caecilians\nAn estimated 185 species comprise the caecilians, a group of amphibians that belong to the order Apoda. They have no limbs,\nalthough they evolved from a legged vertebrate ancestor. The complete lack of limbs makes them resemble earthworms. This\nresemblance is enhanced by folds of skin that look like the segments of an earthworm. However, unlike earthworms, they have\nteeth in both jaws, and feed on a variety of small organisms found in soil, including earthworms! Caecilians are adapted for a\nburrowing or aquatic lifestyle, and they are nearly blind, with their tiny eyes sometimes covered by skin. Although they have a\nsingle lung, they also depend on cutaneous respiration. These animals are found in the tropics of South America, Africa, and\nSouthern Asia. In the caecelians, the only amphibians in which the males have copulatory structures, fertilization is internal.\nSome caecilians are oviparous, but most bear live young. In these cases, the females help nourish their young with tissue from\ntheir oviduct before birth and from their skin after birth.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThe Paleozoic Era and the Evolution of Vertebrates\nWhen the vertebrates arose during the Paleozoic Era (542 to 251 MYA), the climate and geography of Earth was vastly different.\nThe distribution of landmasses on Earth were also very different from that of today. Near the equator were two large\nsupercontinents, Laurentia and Gondwana, which included most of today's continents, but in a radically different\nconfiguration (Figure 29.21). At this time, sea levels were very high, probably at a level that hasn\u2019t been reached since. As the\nPaleozoic progressed, glaciations created a cool global climate, but conditions warmed near the end of the first half of the\nPaleozoic. During the latter half of the Paleozoic, the landmasses began moving together, with the initial formation of a large\nnorthern block called Laurasia, which contained parts of what is now North America, along with Greenland, parts of Europe,\nand Siberia. Eventually, a single supercontinent, called Pangaea, was formed, starting in the latter third of the Paleozoic.\nGlaciations then began to affect Pangaea\u2019s climate and the distribution of vertebrate life.\n794\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 29.21 Paleozoic continents. During the Paleozoic Era, around 550 million years ago, the continent Gondwana formed. Both\nGondwana and the continent Laurentia were located near the equator.\nDuring the early Paleozoic, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was much greater than it is today. This may have\nbegun to change later, as land plants became more common. As the roots of land plants began to infiltrate rock and soil began to\nform, carbon dioxide was drawn out of the atmosphere and became trapped in the rock. This reduced the levels of carbon\ndioxide and increased the levels of oxygen in the atmosphere, so that by the end of the Paleozoic, atmospheric conditions were\nsimilar to those of today.\nAs plants became more common through the latter half of the Paleozoic, microclimates began to emerge and ecosystems began\nto change. As plants and ecosystems continued to grow and become more complex, vertebrates moved from the water to land.\nThe presence of shoreline vegetation may have contributed to the movement of vertebrates onto land. One hypothesis suggests\nthat the fins of aquatic vertebrates were used to maneuver through this vegetation, providing a precursor to the movement of\nfins on land and the further development of limbs. The late Paleozoic was a time of diversification of vertebrates, as amniotes\nemerged and became two different lines that gave rise, on one hand, to synapsids and mammals, and, on the other hand, to the\ncodonts, reptiles, dinosaurs, and birds. Many marine vertebrates became extinct near the end of the Devonian period, which\nended about 360 million years ago, and both marine and terrestrial vertebrates were decimated by a mass extinction in the early\nPermian period about 250 million years ago.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView Earth\u2019s Paleogeography: Continental Movements Through Time (http://openstax.org/l/paleogeography) to see changes in\nEarth as life evolved.\n29.4 Reptiles\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the main characteristics of amniotes\n\u2022\nExplain the difference between anapsids, synapsids, and diapsids, and give an example of each\n\u2022\nIdentify the characteristics of reptiles\n\u2022\nDiscuss the evolution of reptiles\nThe reptiles (including dinosaurs and birds) are distinguished from amphibians by their terrestrially adapted egg, which is\nsupported by four extraembryonic membranes: the yolk sac, the amnion, the chorion, and the allantois (Figure 29.22). The\nchorion and amnion develop from folds in the body wall, and the yolk sac and allantois are extensions of the midgut and hindgut\n29.4 \u2022 Reptiles\n795\nrespectively. The amnion forms a fluid-filled cavity that provides the embryo with its own internal aquatic environment. The\nevolution of the extraembryonic membranes led to less dependence on water for development and thus allowed the amniotes to\nbranch out into drier environments.\nIn addition to these membranes, the eggs of birds, reptiles, and a few mammals have shells. An amniote embryo was then\nenclosed in the amnion, which was in turn encased in an extra-embryonic coelom contained within the chorion. Between the\nshell and the chorion was the albumin of the egg, which provided additional fluid and cushioning. This was a significant\ndevelopment that further distinguishes the amniotes from amphibians, which were and continue to be restricted to moist\nenvironments due their shell-less eggs. Although the shells of various reptilian amniotic species vary significantly, they all\npermit the retention of water and nutrients for the developing embryo. The egg shells of bird (avian reptiles) are hardened with\ncalcium carbonate, making them rigid, but fragile. The shells of most nonavian reptile eggs, such as turtles, are leathery and\nrequire a moist environment. Most mammals do not lay eggs (except for monotremes such as the echindnas and platypuses).\nInstead, the embryo grows within the mother\u2019s body, with the placenta derived from two of the extraembryonic membranes.\nCharacteristics of Amniotes\nThe amniotic egg is the key characteristic of amniotes. In amniotes that lay eggs, the shell of the egg provides protection for the\ndeveloping embryo while being permeable enough to allow for the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. The albumin, or egg\nwhite, outside of the chorion provides the embryo with water and protein, whereas the fattier egg yolk contained in the yolk sac\nprovides nutrients for the embryo, as is the case with the eggs of many other animals, such as amphibians. Here are the\nfunctions of the extraembryonic membranes:\n1.\nBlood vessels in the yolk sac transport yolk nutrients to the circulatory system of the embryo.\n2.\nThe chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg\u2019s external environment.\n3.\nThe allantois stores nitrogenous wastes produced by the embryo and also facilitates respiration.\n4.\nThe amnion protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration.\nIn mammals, the yolk sac is very reduced, but the embryo is still cushioned and enclosed within the amnion. The placenta,\nwhich transports nutrients and functions in gas exchange and waste management, is derived from the chorion and allantois.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 29.22 An amniotic egg.

The\nearly amniotes quickly diverged into two main lines: synapsids and sauropsids. Synapsids included the therapsids, a clade from\nwhich mammals evolved. Sauropsids were further divided into anapsids and diapsids. Diapsids gave rise to the reptiles,\nincluding the dinosaurs and birds. The key differences between the synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids are the structures of the\nskull and the number of temporal fenestrae (\u201cwindows\u201d) behind each eye (Figure 29.23). Temporal fenestrae are post-orbital\nopenings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen. Anapsids have no temporal fenestrae, synapsids have one\n(fused ancestrally from two fenestrae), and diapsids have two (although many diapsids such as birds have highly modified\ndiapsid skulls). Anapsids include extinct organisms and traditionally included turtles. However, more recent molecular and\nfossil evidence clearly shows that turtles arose within the diapsid line and secondarily lost the temporal fenestrae; thus they\nappear to be anapsids because modern turtles do not have fenestrae in the temporal bones of the skull. The canonical diapsids\ninclude dinosaurs, birds, and all other extinct and living reptiles.\nFigure 29.23 Amniote skulls. Compare the skulls and temporal fenestrae of anapsids, synapsids, and diapsids. Anapsids have no openings,\nsynapsids have one opening, and diapsids have two openings.\nThe diapsids in turn diverged into two groups, the Archosauromorpha (\u201cancient lizard form\u201d) and the Lepidosauromorpha\n(\u201cscaly lizard form\u201d) during the Mesozoic period (Figure 29.24). The lepidosaurs include modern lizards, snakes, and tuataras.\nThe archosaurs include modern crocodiles and alligators, and the extinct ichthyosaurs (\u201cfish lizards\u201d superficially resembling\ndolphins), pterosaurs (\u201cwinged lizard\u201d), dinosaurs (\u201cterrible lizard\u201d), and birds. (We should note that clade Dinosauria includes\nbirds, which evolved from a branch of maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs in the Mesozoic.)\nThe evolutionarily derived characteristics of amniotes include the amniotic egg and its four extraembryonic membranes, a\nthicker and more waterproof skin, and rib ventilation of the lungs (ventilation is performed by drawing air into and out of the\nlungs by muscles such as the costal rib muscles and the diaphragm).\n29.4 \u2022 Reptiles\n797\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 29.24 Amniote phylogeny. This chart shows the evolution of amniotes. The placement of Testudines (turtles) is currently still\ndebated.\nQuestion: Members of the order Testudines have an anapsid-like skull without obvious temporal fenestrae. However, molecular\nstudies clearly indicate that turtles descended from a diapsid ancestor. Why might this be the case?\nIn the past, the most common division of amniotes has been into the classes Mammalia, Reptilia, and Aves. However, both birds\nand mammals are descended from different amniote branches: the synapsids giving rise to the therapsids and mammals, and\nthe diapsids giving rise to the lepidosaurs and archosaurs. We will consider both the birds and the mammals as groups distinct\nfrom reptiles for the purpose of this discussion with the understanding that this does not accurately reflect phylogenetic history\nand relationships.\nCharacteristics of Reptiles\nReptiles are tetrapods. Limbless reptiles\u2014snakes and legless lizards\u2014are classified as tetrapods because they are descended\nfrom four-limbed ancestors. Reptiles lay calcareous or leathery eggs enclosed in shells on land. Even aquatic reptiles return to\nthe land to lay eggs. They usually reproduce sexually with internal fertilization. Some species display ovoviviparity, with the eggs\nremaining in the mother\u2019s body until they are ready to hatch. In ovoviviparous reptiles, most nutrients are supplied by the egg\nyolk, while the chorioallantois assists with respiration. Other species are viviparous, with the offspring born alive, with their\ndevelopment supported by a yolk sac-placenta, a chorioallantoic-placenta, or both.\nOne of the key adaptations that permitted reptiles to live on land was the development of their scaly skin, containing the protein\nkeratin and waxy lipids, which reduced water loss from the skin. A number of keratinous epidermal structures have emerged in\nthe descendants of various reptilian lineages and some have become defining characters for these lineages: scales, claws, nails,\nhorns, feathers, and hair. Their occlusive skin means that reptiles cannot use their skin for respiration, like amphibians, and\nthus all amniotes breathe with lungs. All reptiles grow throughout their lives and regularly shed their skin, both to accommodate\ntheir growth and to rid themselves of ectoparasites. Snakes tend to shed the entire skin at one time, but other reptiles shed their\nskins in patches.\nReptiles ventilate their lungs using various muscular mechanisms to produce negative pressure (low pressure) within the lungs\nthat allows them to expand and draw in air. In snakes and lizards, the muscles of the spine and ribs are used to expand or\ncontract the rib cage. Since walking or running interferes with this activity, the squamates cannot breathe effectively while\n798\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nrunning. Some squamates can supplement rib movement with buccal pumping through the nose, with the mouth closed. In\ncrocodilians, the lung chamber is expanded and contracted by moving the liver, which is attached to the pelvis. Turtles have a\nspecial problem with breathing, because their rib cage cannot expand. However, they can change the pressure around the lungs\nby pulling their limbs in and out of the shell, and by moving their internal organs. Some turtles also have a posterior respiratory\nsac that opens off the hindgut that aids in the diffusion of gases.\nMost reptiles are ectotherms, animals whose main source of body heat comes from the environment; however, some\ncrocodilians maintain elevated thoracic temperatures and thus appear to be at least regional endotherms. This is in contrast to\ntrue endotherms, which use heat produced by metabolism and muscle contraction to regulate body temperature over a very\nnarrow temperature range, and thus are properly referred to as homeotherms. Reptiles have behavioral adaptations to help\nregulate body temperature, such as basking in sunny places to warm up through the absorption of solar radiation, or finding\nshady spots or going underground to minimize the absorption of solar radiation, which allows them to cool down and prevent\noverheating. The advantage of ectothermy is that metabolic energy from food is not required to heat the body; therefore, reptiles\ncan survive on about 10 percent of the calories required by a similarly sized endotherm. In cold weather, some reptiles such as\nthe garter snake brumate. Brumation is similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long\nperiods without eating, but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves. Rather,\ntheir metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures, and the animal is very sluggish.\nEvolution of Reptiles\nReptiles originated approximately 300 million years ago during the Carboniferous period. One of the oldest known amniotes is\nCasineria, which had both amphibian and reptilian characteristics. One of the earliest undisputed reptile fossils was\nHylonomus, a lizardlike animal about 20 cm long. Soon after the first amniotes appeared, they diverged into three\ngroups\u2014synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids\u2014during the Permian period. The Permian period also saw a second major\ndivergence of diapsid reptiles into stem archosaurs (predecessors of thecodonts, crocodilians, dinosaurs, and birds) and\nlepidosaurs (predecessors of snakes and lizards). These groups remained inconspicuous until the Triassic period, when the\narchosaurs became the dominant terrestrial group possibly due to the extinction of large-bodied anapsids and synapsids during\nthe Permian-Triassic extinction. About 250 million years ago, archosaurs radiated into the pterosaurs and both saurischian\n\u201clizard hip\u201d and ornithischian \u201cbird-hip\u201d dinosaurs (see below).\nAlthough they are sometimes mistakenly called dinosaurs, the pterosaurs were distinct from true dinosaurs (Figure 29.25).\nPterosaurs had a number of adaptations that allowed for flight, including hollow bones (birds also exhibit hollow bones, a case\nof convergent evolution). Their wings were formed by membranes of skin that attached to the long, fourth finger of each arm\nand extended along the body to the legs.\nFigure 29.25 Pterosaurs. Pterosaurs, such as this Quetzalcoatlus, which existed from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous period (230 to\n65.5 million years ago), possessed wings but are not believed to have been capable of powered flight. Instead, they may have been able to\nsoar after launching from cliffs. (credit: Mark Witton, Darren Naish)\nArchosaurs: Dinosaurs\nDinosaurs (\u201cfearfully-great lizard\u201d) include the Saurischia (\u201clizard-hipped\u201d) with a simple, three-pronged pelvis, and\n29.4 \u2022 Reptiles\n799\nOrnithischia (\u201cbird-hipped\u201d) dinosaurs with a more complex pelvis, superficially similar to that of birds. However, it is a fact\nthat birds evolved from the saurischian \u201clizard hipped\u201d lineage, not the ornithischian \u201cbird hip\u201d lineage. Dinosaurs and their\ntheropod descendants, the birds, are remnants of what was formerly a hugely diverse group of reptiles, some of which like\nArgentinosaurus were nearly 40 meters (130 feet) in length and weighed at least 80,000 kg (88 tons). They were the largest land\nanimals to have lived, challenging and perhaps exceeding the great blue whale in size, but probably not weight\u2014which could be\ngreater than 200 tons.\nHerrerasaurus, a bipedal dinosaur from Argentina, was one of the earliest dinosaurs that walked upright with the legs\npositioned directly below the pelvis, rather than splayed outward to the sides as in the crocodilians. The Ornithischia were all\nherbivores, and sometimes evolved into crazy shapes, such as ankylosaur \u201carmored tanks\u201d and horned dinosaurs such as\nTriceratops. Some, such as Parasaurolophus, lived in great herds and may have amplified their species-specific calls through\nelaborate crests on their heads.\nBoth the ornithischian and saurischian dinosaurs provided parental care for their broods, just as crocodilians and birds do\ntoday. The end of the age of dinosaurs came about 65 million years ago, during the Mesozoic, coinciding with the impact of a\nlarge asteroid (that produced the Chicxulub crater) in what is now the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Besides the immediate\nenvironmental disasters associated with this asteroid impacting the Earth at about 45,000 miles per hour, the impact may also\nhave helped generate an enormous series of volcanic eruptions that changed the distribution and abundance of plant life\nworldwide, as well as its climate. At the end of the Triassic, massive volcanic activity across North America, South America,\nAfrica, and southwest Europe ultimately would lead to the break-up of Pangea and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The\nformerly incredibly diverse dinosaurs (save for the evolving birds) met their extinction during this time period.\nArchosaurs: Pterosaurs\nMore than 200 species of pterosaurs have been described, and in their day, beginning about 230 million years ago, they were the\nundisputed rulers of the Mesozoic skies for over 170 million years. Recent fossils suggest that hundreds of pterosaur species may\nhave lived during any given period, dividing up the environment much like birds do today. Pterosaurs came in amazing sizes\nand shapes, ranging in size from that of a small song bird to that of the enormous Quetzalcoatlus northropi, which stood nearly\n6 meters (19 feet) high and had a wingspan of nearly 14 meters (40 feet). This monstrous pterosaur, named after the Aztec god\nQuetzalcoatl, the feathered flying serpent that contributed largely to the creation of humankind, may have been the largest\nflying animal that ever evolved!\nSome male pterosaurs apparently had brightly colored crests that may have served in sexual displays; some of these crests were\nmuch higher than the actual head! Pterosaurs had ultralight skeletons, with a pteroid bone, unique to pterosaurs, that\nstrengthened the forewing membrane. Much of their wing span was exaggerated by a greatly elongated fourth finger that\nsupported perhaps half of the wing. It is tempting to relate to them in terms of bird characteristics, but in reality, their\nproportions were decidedly not like birds at all. For example, it is common to find specimens, such as Quetzalcoatlus, with a\nhead and neck region that together was three to four times as large as the torso. In addition, unlike the feathered bird wing, the\nreptilian wing had a layer of muscles, connective tissue, and blood vessels, all reinforced with a webbing of fibrous cords.\nIn contrast to the aerial pterosaurs, the dinosaurs were a diverse group of terrestrial reptiles with more than 1,000 species\nclassified to date. Paleontologists continue to discover new species of dinosaurs. Some dinosaurs were quadrupeds (Figure\n29.26); others were bipeds. Some were carnivorous, whereas others were herbivorous. Dinosaurs laid eggs, and a number of\nnests containing fossilized eggs, with intact embryos, have been found. It is not known with certainty whether dinosaurs were\nhomeotherms or facultative endotherms. However, given that modern birds are endothermic, the dinosaurs that were the\nimmediate ancestors to birds likely were endothermic as well. Some fossil evidence exists for dinosaurian parental care, and\ncomparative biology supports this hypothesis since the archosaur birds and crocodilians both display extensive parental care.\n800\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 29.26 Ornithischian and saurischian Dinosaurs.

(credit: a Mariana Ruiz Villareal b Zach Tirrell from Plymouth, USA, Dino Origins)\nDinosaurs dominated the Mesozoic era, which was known as the \u201cAge of Reptiles.\u201d The dominance of dinosaurs lasted until the\nend of the Cretaceous, the last period of the Mesozoic era. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction resulted in the loss of most of the\nlarge-bodied animals of the Mesozoic era. Birds are the only living descendants of one of the major clades of theropod\ndinosaurs.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this site to see a video (http://openstax.org/l/K-T_extinction) discussing the hypothesis that an asteroid caused the\nCretaceous-Triassic (KT) extinction.\nModern Reptiles\nClass Reptilia includes many diverse species that are classified into four living clades. There are the 25 species of Crocodilia, two\nspecies of Sphenodontia, approximately 9,200 Squamata species, and about 325 species of Testudines.\nCrocodilia\nCrocodilia (\u201csmall lizard\u201d) arose as a distinct lineage by the middle Triassic; extant species include alligators, crocodiles,\ngharials, and caimans. Crocodilians (Figure 29.27) live throughout the tropics and subtropics of Africa, South America, Southern\nFlorida, Asia, and Australia. They are found in freshwater, saltwater, and brackish habitats, such as rivers and lakes, and spend\nmost of their time in water. Crocodiles are descended from terrestrial reptiles and can still walk and run well on land. They often\nmove on their bellies in a swimming motion, propelled by alternate movements of their legs. However, some species can lift\ntheir bodies off the ground, pulling their legs in under the body with their feet rotated to face forward. This mode of locomotion\ntakes a lot of energy, and seems to be used primarily to clear ground obstacles. Amazingly, some crocodiles can also gallop,\npushing off with their hind legs and moving their hind and forelegs alternately in pairs. Galloping crocodiles have been clocked\nat speeds over 17 kph and, over short distances, in an ambush situation, they can easily chase down most humans if they are\ntaken by surprise. However, they are short distance runners, not interested in a long chase, and most fit humans can probably\noutrun them in a sprint (assuming they respond quickly to the ambush!).\n29.4 \u2022 Reptiles\n801\nFigure 29.27 A crocodilian. Crocodilians, such as this Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis), provide parental care for their offspring.\n(credit: Keshav Mukund Kandhadai)\nSphenodontia\nSphenodontia (\u201cwedge tooth\u201d) arose in the early Mesozoic era, when they had a moderate radiation, but now are represented by\nonly two living species: Sphenodon punctatus and Sphenodon guntheri, both found on offshore islands in New Zealand (Figure\n29.28). The common name \"tuatara\" comes from a Maori word describing the crest along its back. Tuataras have a primitive\ndiapsid skull with biconcave vertebrae. They measure up to 80 centimeters and weigh about 1 kilogram. Although superficially\nsimilar to an iguanid lizard, several unique features of the skull and jaws clearly define them and distinguish this group from\nthe Squamata. They have no external ears. Tuataras briefly have a third (parietal) eye\u2014with a lens, retina, and cornea\u2014in the\nmiddle of the forehead. The eye is visible only in very young animals; it is soon covered with skin. Parietal eyes can sense light,\nbut have limited color discrimination. Similar light-sensing structures are also seen in some other lizards. In their jaws,\ntuataras have two rows of teeth in the upper jaw that bracket a single row of teeth in the lower jaw. These teeth are actually\nprojections from the jawbones, and are not replaced as they wear down.\nFigure 29.28 A tuatara. This tuatara from New Zealand may resemble a lizard but belongs to a distinct lineage, the Sphenodontidae family.\n(credit: Sid Mosdell)\nSquamata\nThe Squamata (\u201cscaly or having scales\u201d) arose in the late Permian, and extant species include lizards and snakes. Both are found\non all continents except Antarctica. Lizards and snakes are most closely related to tuataras, both groups having evolved from a\nlepidosaurian ancestor. Squamata is the largest extant clade of reptiles (Figure 29.29).\n802\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 29.29 A chameleon. This Jackson\u2019s chameleon (Trioceros jacksonii) blends in with its surroundings.\nMost lizards differ from snakes by having four limbs, although these have often been lost or significantly reduced in at least 60\nlineages. Snakes lack eyelids and external ears, which are both present in lizards. There are about 6,000 species of lizards,\nranging in size from tiny chameleons and geckos, some of which are only a few centimeters in length, to the Komodo dragon,\nwhich is about 3 meters in length.\nSome lizards are extravagantly decorated with spines, crests, and frills, and many are brightly colored. Some lizards, like\nchameleons (Figure 29.29), can change their skin color by redistributing pigment within chromatophores in their skins.\nChameleons change color both for camouflage and for social signaling. Lizards have multiple-colored oil droplets in their retinal\ncells that give them a good range of color vision. Lizards, unlike snakes, can focus their eyes by changing the shape of the lens.\nThe eyes of chameleons can move independently. Several species of lizards have a \"hidden\" parietal eye, similar to that in the\ntuatara. Both lizards and snakes use their tongues to sample the environment and a pit in the roof of the mouth, Jacobson's\norgan, is used to evaluate the collected sample.\nMost lizards are carnivorous, but some large species, such as iguanas, are herbivores. Some predatory lizards are ambush\npredators, waiting quietly until their prey is close enough for a quick grab. Others are patient foragers, moving slowly through\ntheir environment to detect possible prey. Lizard tongues are long and sticky and can be extended at high speed for capturing\ninsects or other small prey. Traditionally, the only venomous lizards are the Gila monster and the beaded lizard. However,\nvenom glands have also been identified in several species of monitors and iguanids, but the venom is not injected directly and\nshould probably be regarded as a toxin delivered with the bite.\nSpecialized features of the jaw are related to adaptations for feeding that have evolved to feed on relatively large prey (even\nthough some current species have reversed this trend). Snakes are thought to have descended from either burrowing or aquatic\nlizards over 100 million years ago (Figure 29.30). They include about 3,600 species, ranging in size from 10 centimeter-long\nthread snakes to 10 meter-long pythons and anacondas. All snakes are legless, except for boids (e.g., boa constrictors), which\nhave vestigial hindlimbs in the form of pelvic spurs. Like caecilian amphibians, the narrow bodies of most snakes have only a\nsingle functional lung. All snakes are carnivorous and eat small animals, birds, eggs, fish, and insects.\n29.4 \u2022 Reptiles\n803\nFigure 29.30 A nonvenomous snake. The garter snake belongs to the genus Thamnophis, the most widely distributed reptile genus in North\nAmerica. (credit: Steve Jurvetson)\nMost snakes have a skull that is very flexible, involving eight rotational joints. They also differ from other squamates by having\nmandibles (lower jaws) without either bony or ligamentous attachment anteriorly. Having this connection via skin and muscle\nallows for great dynamic expansion of the gape and independent motion of the two sides\u2014both advantages in swallowing big\nprey. Most snakes are nonvenomous and simply swallow their prey alive, or subdue it by constriction before swallowing it.\nVenomous snakes use their venom both to kill or immobilize their prey, and to help digest it.\nAlthough snakes have no eyelids, their eyes are protected with a transparent scale. Their retinas have both rods and cones, and\nlike many animals, they do not have receptor pigments for red light. Some species, however, can see in the ultraviolet, which\nallows them to track ultraviolet signals in rodent trails. Snakes adjust focus by moving their heads. They have lost both external\nand middle ears, although their inner ears are sensitive to ground vibrations. Snakes have a number of sensory structures that\nassist in tracking prey. In pit vipers, like rattlesnakes, a sensory pit between the eye and nostrils is sensitive to infrared (\u201cheat\u201d)\nemissions from warm-blooded prey. A row of similar pits is located on the upper lip of boids. As noted above, snakes also use\nJacobson's organ for detecting olfactory signals.\nTestudines\nThe turtles, terrapins, and tortoises are members of the clade Testudines (\u201chaving a shell\u201d) (Figure 29.31), and are characterized\nby a bony or cartilaginous shell. The shell in turtles is not just an epidermal covering, but is incorporated into the skeletal\nsystem. The dorsal shell is called the carapace and includes the backbone and ribs; the ventral shell is called the plastron. Both\nshells are covered with keratinous plates or scutes, and the two shells are held together by a bridge. In some turtles, the plastron\nis hinged to allow the head and legs to be withdrawn under the shell.\nThe two living groups of turtles, Pleurodira and Cryptodira, have significant anatomical differences and are most easily\nrecognized by how they retract their necks. The more common Cryptodira retract their neck in a vertical S-curve; they appear to\nsimply pull their head backward when retracting. Less common Pleurodira (\"side-neck\") retract their neck with a horizontal\ncurve, basically folding their neck to the side.\nThe Testudines arose approximately 200 million years ago, predating crocodiles, lizards, and snakes. There are about 325 living\nspecies of turtles and tortoises. Like other reptiles, turtles are ectotherms. All turtles are oviparous, laying their eggs on land,\nalthough many species live in or near water. None exhibit parental care. Turtles range in size from the speckled padloper\ntortoise at 8 centimeters (3.1 inches) to the leatherback sea turtle at 200 centimeters (over 6 feet). The term \u201cturtle\u201d is sometimes\nused to describe only those species of Testudines that live in the sea, with the terms \u201ctortoise\u201d and \u201cterrapin\u201d used to refer to\nspecies that live on land and in fresh water, respectively.\n804\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 29.31 A tortoise.

(credit: Jim Bowen)\n29.5 Birds\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the evolutionary history of birds\n\u2022\nDescribe the derived characteristics in birds that facilitate flight\nWith over 10,000 identified species, the birds are the most speciose of the land vertebrate classes. Abundant research has shown\nthat birds are really an extant clade that evolved from maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs about 150 million years ago. Thus, even\nthough the most obvious characteristic that seems to set birds apart from other extant vertebrates is the presence of feathers,\nwe now know that feathers probably appeared in the common ancestor of both ornithischian and saurischian lineages of\ndinosaurs. Feathers in these clades are also homologous to reptilian scales and mammalian hair, according to the most recent\nresearch. While the wings of vertebrates like bats function without feathers, birds rely on feathers, and wings, along with other\nmodifications of body structure and physiology, for flight, as we shall see.\nCharacteristics of Birds\nBirds are endothermic, and more specifically, homeothermic\u2014meaning that they usually maintain an elevated and constant\nbody temperature, which is significantly above the average body temperature of most mammals. This is, in part, due to the fact\nthat active flight\u2014especially the hovering skills of birds such as hummingbirds\u2014requires enormous amounts of energy, which\nin turn necessitates a high metabolic rate. Like mammals (which are also endothermic and homeothermic and covered with an\ninsulating pelage), birds have several different types of feathers that together keep \u201cheat\u201d (infrared energy) within the core of the\nbody, away from the surface where it can be lost by radiation and convection to the environment.\nModern birds produce two main types of feathers: contour feathers and down feathers. Contour feathers have a number of\nparallel barbs that branch from a central shaft. The barbs in turn have microscopic branches called barbules that are linked\ntogether by minute hooks, making the vane of a feather a strong, flexible, and uninterrupted surface. In contrast, the barbules\nof down feathers do not interlock, making these feathers especially good for insulation, trapping air in spaces between the\nloose, interlocking barbules of adjacent feathers to decrease the rate of heat loss by convection and radiation. Certain parts of a\nbird\u2019s body are covered in down feathers, and the base of other feathers has a downy portion, whereas newly hatched birds are\ncovered almost entirely in down, which serves as an excellent coat of insulation, increasing the thermal boundary layer between\nthe skin and the outside environment.\nFeathers not only provide insulation, but also allow for flight, producing the lift and thrust necessary for flying birds to become\nand stay airborne. The feathers on a wing are flexible, so the feathers at the end of the wing separate as air moves over them,\nreducing the drag on the wing. Flight feathers are also asymmetrical and curved, so that air flowing over them generates lift.\nTwo types of flight feathers are found on the wings, primary feathers and secondary feathers (Figure 29.32). Primary feathers\nare located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust as the bird moves its wings downward, using the pectoralis major muscles.\n29.5 \u2022 Birds\n805\nSecondary feathers are located closer to the body, in the forearm portion of the wing, and provide lift. In contrast to primary\nand secondary feathers, contour feathers are found on the body, where they help reduce form drag produced by wind resistance\nagainst the body during flight. They create a smooth, aerodynamic surface so that air moves swiftly over the bird\u2019s body,\npreventing turbulence and creating ideal aerodynamic conditions for efficient flight.\nFigure 29.32 Flight feathers. (a) Primary feathers are located at the wing tip and provide thrust; secondary feathers are located close to the\nbody and provide lift. (b) Primary and secondary feathers from a common buzzard (Buteo buteo). (Credit b: Mod. from S. Seyfert\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=613813 (http://openstax.org/l/buzzard_feathers) )\nFlapping of the entire wing occurs primarily through the actions of the chest muscles: Specifically, the contraction of the\npectoralis major muscles moves the wings downward (downstroke), whereas contraction of the supracoracoideus muscles\nmoves the wings upward (upstroke) via a tough tendon that passes over the coracoid bone and the top of the humerus. Both\nmuscles are attached to the keel of the sternum, and these are the muscles that humans eat on holidays (this is why the back of\nthe bird offers little meat!). These muscles are highly developed in birds and account for a higher percentage of body mass than\nin most mammals. The flight muscles attach to a blade-shaped keel projecting ventrally from the sternum, like the keel of a boat.\nThe sternum of birds is deeper than that of other vertebrates, which accommodates the large flight muscles. The flight muscles\nof birds who are active flyers are rich with oxygen-storing myoglobin. Another skeletal modification found in most birds is the\nfusion of the two clavicles (collarbones), forming the furcula or wishbone. The furcula is flexible enough to bend and provide\nsupport to the shoulder girdle during flapping.\nAn important requirement for flight is a low body weight. As body weight increases, the muscle output required for flying\nincreases. The largest living bird is the ostrich, and while it is much smaller than the largest mammals, it is secondarily\nflightless. For birds that do fly, reduction in body weight makes flight easier. Several modifications are found in birds to reduce\nbody weight, including pneumatization of bones. Pneumatic bones (Figure 29.33) are bones that are hollow, rather than filled\nwith tissue; cross struts of bone called trabeculae provide structural reinforcement. Pneumatic bones are not found in all birds,\nand they are more extensive in large birds than in small birds. Not all bones of the skeleton are pneumatic, although the skulls of\nalmost all birds are. The jaw is also lightened by the replacement of heavy jawbones and teeth with a beak made of keratin (just\nas hair, scales, and feathers are).\n806\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 29.33 Pneumatic bone. Many birds have hollow, pneumatic bones, which make flight easier.\nOther modifications that reduce weight include the lack of a urinary bladder. Birds possess a cloaca, an external body cavity into\nwhich the intestinal, urinary, and genital orifices empty in reptiles, birds, and the monotreme mammals. The cloaca allows\nwater to be reabsorbed from waste back into the bloodstream. Thus, uric acid is not eliminated as a liquid but is concentrated\ninto urate salts, which are expelled along with fecal matter. In this way, water is not held in a urinary bladder, which would\nincrease body weight. In addition, the females of most bird species only possess one functional (left) ovary rather than two,\nfurther reducing body mass.\nThe respiratory system of birds is dramatically different from that of reptiles and mammals, and is well adapted for the high\nmetabolic rate required for flight. To begin, the air spaces of pneumatic bone are sometimes connected to air sacs in the body\ncavity, which replace coelomic fluid and also lighten the body. These air sacs are also connected to the path of airflow through\nthe bird's body, and function in respiration. Unlike mammalian lungs in which air flows in two directions, as it is breathed in\nand out, diluting the concentration of oxygen, airflow through bird lungs is unidirectional (Figure 29.34). Gas exchange occurs\nin \"air capillaries\" or microscopic air passages within the lungs. The arrangement of air capillaries in the lungs creates a counter-\ncurrent exchange system with the pulmonary blood. In a counter-current system, the air flows in one direction and the blood\nflows in the opposite direction, producing a favorable diffusion gradient and creating an efficient means of gas exchange. This\nvery effective oxygen-delivery system of birds supports their higher metabolic activity. In effect, ventilation is provided by the\nparabronchi (minimally expandible lungs) with thin air sacs located among the visceral organs and the skeleton. A syrinx (voice\nbox) resides near the junction of the trachea and bronchi. The syrinx, however, is not homologous to the mammalian larynx,\nwhich resides within the upper part of the trachea.\nFigure 29.34 Air flow in bird lungs. Avian respiration is an efficient system of gas exchange with air flowing unidirectionally. A full ventilation\ncycle takes two breathing cycles. During the first inhalation, air passes from the trachea into posterior air sacs, then during the first\nexhalation into the lungs. The second inhalation moves the air in the lungs to the anterior air sacs, and the second exhalation moves the air\nin the anterior air sacs out of the body. Overall, each inhalation moves air into the air sacs, while each exhalation moves fresh air through\nthe lungs and \"used\" air out of the body. The air sacs are connected to the hollow interior of bones. (credit: modification of work by L.\nShyamal)\nBeyond the unique characteristics discussed above, birds are also unusual vertebrates because of a number of other features.\nFirst, they typically have an elongate (very \u201cdinosaurian\u201d) S-shaped neck, but a short tail or pygostyle, produced from the fusion\nof the caudal vertebrae. Unlike mammals, birds have only one occipital condyle, allowing them extensive movement of the head\nand neck. They also have a very thin epidermis without sweat glands, and a specialized uropygial gland or sebaceous \u201cpreening\ngland\u201d found at the dorsal base of the tail. This gland is an essential to preening (a virtually continuous activity) in most birds\nbecause it produces an oily substance that birds use to help waterproof their feathers as well as keep them flexible for flight. A\n29.5 \u2022 Birds\n807\nnumber of birds, such as pigeons, parrots, hawks, and owls, lack a uropygial gland but have specialized feathers that\n\u201cdisintegrate\u201d into a powdery down, which serves the same purpose as the oils of the uropygial gland.\nLike mammals, birds have 12 pairs of cranial nerves, and a very large cerebellum and optic lobes, but only a single bone in the\nmiddle ear called the columella (the stapes in mammals). They have a closed circulatory system with two atria and two\nventricles, but rather than a \u201cleft-bending\u201d aortic arch like that of mammals, they have a \u201cright-bending\u201d aortic arch, and\nnucleated red blood cells (unlike the enucleated red blood cells of mammals).\nAll these unique and highly derived characteristics make birds one of the most conspicuous and successful groups of vertebrate\nanimals, filling a range of ecological niches, and ranging in size from the tiny bee hummingbird of Cuba (about 2 grams) to the\nostrich (about 140,000 grams). Their large brains, keen senses, and the abilities of many species to imitate vocalization and use\ntools make them some of the most intelligent vertebrates on Earth.\nEvolution of Birds\nThanks to amazing new fossil discoveries in China, the evolutionary history of birds has become clearer, even though bird bones\ndo not fossilize as well as those of other vertebrates. As we\u2019ve seen earlier, birds are highly modified diapsids, but rather than\nhaving two fenestrations or openings in their skulls behind the eye, the skulls of modern birds are so specialized that it is\ndifficult to see any trace of the original diapsid condition.\nBirds belong to a group of diapsids called the archosaurs, which includes three other groups: living crocodilians, pterosaurs,\nand dinosaurs. Overwhelming evidence shows that birds evolved within the clade Dinosauria, which is further subdivided into\ntwo groups, the Saurischia (\u201clizard hips\u201d) and the Ornithischia (\u201cbird hips\u201d). Despite the names of these groups, it was not the\nbird-hipped dinosaurs that gave rise to modern birds. Rather, Saurischia diverged into two groups: One included the long-\nnecked herbivorous dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus. The second group, bipedal predators called theropods, gave rise to birds.\nThis course of evolution is highlighted by numerous similarities between late (maniraptoran) theropod fossils and birds,\nspecifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones, as well as the presence of the wishbone, formed by the fusion of the\nclavicles.\nThe clade Neornithes includes the avian crown group, which comprises all living birds and the descendants from their most\nrecent common maniraptoran ancestor. One well-known and important fossil of an animal that appears \u201cintermediate\u201d between\ndinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx (Figure 29.35), which is from the Jurassic period (200 to 145 MYA). Archaeopteryx has\ncharacteristics of both maniraptoran dinosaurs and modern birds. Some scientists propose classifying it as a bird, but others\nprefer to classify it as a dinosaur. Traits in skeletons of Archaeopteryx like those of a dinosaur included a jaw with teeth and a\nlong bony tail. Like birds, it had feathers modified for flight, both on the forelimbs and on the tail, a trait associated only with\nbirds among modern animals. Fossils of older feathered dinosaurs exist, but the feathers may not have had the characteristics of\nmodern flight feathers.\nFigure 29.35 Archaeopteryx. (a) Archaeopteryx lived in the late Jurassic period around 150 million years ago. It had cuplike thecodont\nteeth like a dinosaur, but had (b) flight feathers like modern birds, which can be seen in this fossil. Note the claws on the wings, which are\nstill found in a number of birds, such as the newborn chicks of the South American Hoatzin.\n808\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe Evolution of Flight in Birds\nThere are two basic hypotheses that explain how flight may have evolved in birds: the arboreal (\u201ctree\u201d) hypothesis and the\nterrestrial (\u201cland\u201d) hypothesis. The arboreal hypothesis posits that tree-dwelling precursors to modern birds jumped from\nbranch to branch using their feathers for gliding before becoming fully capable of flapping flight. In contrast to this, the\nterrestrial hypothesis holds that running (perhaps pursuing active prey such as small cursorial animals) was the stimulus for\nflight. In this scenario, wings could be used to capture prey and were preadapted for balance and flapping flight. Ostriches,\nwhich are large flightless birds, hold their wings out when they run, possibly for balance. However, this condition may represent\na behavioral relict of the clade of flying birds that were their ancestors. It seems more likely that small feathered arboreal\ndinosaurs, were capable of gliding (and flapping) from tree to tree and branch to branch, improving the chances of escaping\nenemies, finding mates, and obtaining prey such as flying insects. This early flight behavior would have also greatly increased\nthe opportunity for species dispersal.\nAlthough we have a good understanding of how feathers and flight may have evolved, the question of how endothermy evolved\nin birds (and other lineages) remains unanswered. Feathers provide insulation, but this is only beneficial for thermoregulatory\npurposes if body heat is being produced internally. Similarly, internal heat production is only viable for the evolution of\nendothermy if insulation is present to retain that infrared energy. It has been suggested that one or the other\u2014feathers or\nendothermy\u2014evolved first in response to some other selective pressure (e.g., the ability to be active at night, provide\ncamouflage, repel water, or serve as signals for mate selection). It seems probable that feathers and endothermy coevolved\ntogether, the improvement and evolutionary advancement of feathers reinforcing the evolutionary advancement of endothermy,\nand so on.\nDuring the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 MYA), a group known as the Enantiornithes was the dominant bird type (Figure 29.36).\nEnantiornithes means \u201copposite birds,\u201d which refers to the fact that certain bones of the shoulder are joined differently than the\nway the bones are joined in modern birds. Like Archaeopteryx, these birds retained teeth in their jaws, but did have a shortened\ntail, and at least some fossils have preserved \u201cfans\u201d of tail feathers. These birds formed an evolutionary lineage separate from\nthat of modern birds, and they did not survive past the Cretaceous. Along with the Enantiornithes, however, another group of\nbirds\u2014the Ornithurae (\"bird tails\"), with a short, fused tail or pygostyle\u2014emerged from the evolutionary line that includes\nmodern birds. This clade was also present in the Cretaceous.\nAfter the extinction of Enantiornithes, the Ornithurae became the dominant birds, with a large and rapid radiation occurring\nafter the extinction of the dinosaurs during the Cenozoic era (66 MYA to the present). Molecular analysis based on very large\ndata sets has produced our current understanding of the relationships among living birds. There are three major clades: the\nPaleognathae, the Galloanserae, and the Neoaves. The Paleognathae (\u201cold jaw\u201d) or ratites (polyphyletic) are a group of flightless\nbirds including ostriches, emus, rheas, and kiwis. The Galloanserae include pheasants, ducks, geese and swans. The Neoaves\n(\"new birds\") includes all other birds. The Neoaves themselves have been distributed among five clades:3 Strisores (nightjars,\nswifts, and hummingbirds), Columbaves (turacos, bustards, cuckoos, pigeons, and doves), Gruiformes (cranes),\nAequorlitornithes (diving birds, wading birds, and shorebirds), and Inopinaves (a very large clade of land birds including hawks,\nowls, woodpeckers, parrots, falcons, crows, and songbirds). Despite the current classification scheme, it is important to\nunderstand that phylogenetic revisions, even for the extant birds, are still taking place.\n3Prum, RO et al. 2015.

They treat pets, livestock,\nand animals in zoos and laboratories. Veterinarians often treat dogs and cats, but also take care of birds, reptiles, rabbits, and\nother animals that are kept as pets. Veterinarians that work with farms and ranches care for pigs, goats, cows, sheep, and\nhorses.\nVeterinarians are required to complete a degree in veterinary medicine, which includes taking courses in comparative zoology,\nanimal anatomy and physiology, microbiology, and pathology, among many other courses in chemistry, physics, and\nmathematics.\nVeterinarians are also trained to perform surgery on many different vertebrate species, which requires an understanding of the\nvastly different anatomies of various species. For example, the stomach of ruminants like cows has four \u201ccompartments\u201d versus\none compartment for non-ruminants. As we have seen, birds also have unique anatomical adaptations that allow for flight,\nwhich requires additional training and care.\nSome veterinarians conduct research in academic settings, broadening our knowledge of animals and medical science. One area\nof research involves understanding the transmission of animal diseases to humans, called zoonotic diseases. For example, one\narea of great concern is the transmission of the avian flu virus to humans. One type of avian flu virus, H5N1, is a highly\npathogenic strain that has been spreading in birds in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Although the virus does not\ncross over easily to humans, there have been cases of bird-to-human transmission. More research is needed to understand how\nthis virus can cross the species barrier and how its spread can be prevented.\n29.6 Mammals\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nName and describe the distinguishing features of the three main groups of mammals\n\u2022\nDescribe the likely line of evolutionary descent that produced mammals\n\u2022\nList some derived features that may have arisen in response to mammals\u2019 need for constant, high-level\nmetabolism\n\u2022\nIdentify the major clades of eutherian mammals\nMammals, comprising about 5,200 species, are vertebrates that possess hair and mammary glands. Several other\ncharacteristics are distinctive to mammals, including certain features of the jaw, skeleton, integument, and internal anatomy.\nModern mammals belong to three clades: monotremes, marsupials, and eutherians (or placental mammals).\n810\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nCharacteristics of Mammals\nThe presence of hair, composed of the protein keratin, is one of the most obvious characteristics of mammals. Although it is not\nvery extensive or obvious on some species (such as whales), hair has many important functions for most mammals. Mammals\nare endothermic, and hair traps a boundary layer of air close to the body, retaining heat generated by metabolic activity. Along\nwith insulation, hair can serve as a sensory mechanism via specialized hairs called vibrissae, better known as whiskers.\nVibrissae attach to nerves that transmit information about tactile vibration produced by sound sensation, which is particularly\nuseful to nocturnal or burrowing mammals. Hair can also provide protective coloration or be part of social signaling, such as\nwhen an animal\u2019s hair stands \u201con end\u201d to warn enemies, or possibly to make the mammal \u201clook bigger\u201d to predators.\nUnlike the skin of birds, the integument (skin) of mammals, includes a number of different types of secretory glands. Sebaceous\nglands produce a lipid mixture called sebum that is secreted onto the hair and skin, providing water resistance and lubrication\nfor hair. Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body. Eccrine glands produce sweat, or perspiration, which is mainly\ncomposed of water, but also contains metabolic waste products, and sometimes compounds with antibiotic activity. In most\nmammals, eccrine glands are limited to certain areas of the body, and some mammals do not possess them at all. However, in\nprimates, especially humans, sweat glands are located over most of the body surface and figure prominently in regulating the\nbody temperature through evaporative cooling. Apocrine glands, or scent glands, secrete substances that are used for chemical\ncommunication, such as in skunks. Mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns. In both monotremes and\neutherians, both males and females possess mammary glands, while in marsupials, mammary glands have been found only in\nsome opossums. Mammary glands likely are modified sebaceous or eccrine glands, but their evolutionary origin is not entirely\nclear.\nThe skeletal system of mammals possesses many unique features. The lower jaw of mammals consists of only one bone, the\ndentary, and the jaw hinge connects the dentary to the squamosal (flat) part of the temporal bone in the skull. The jaws of other\nvertebrates are composed of several bones, including the quadrate bone at the back of the skull and the articular bone at the\nback of the jaw, with the jaw connected between the quadrate and articular bones. In the ear of other vertebrates, vibrations are\ntransmitted to the inner ear by a single bone, the stapes. In mammals, the quadrate and articular bones have moved into the\nmiddle ear (Figure 29.37). The malleus is derived from the articular bone, whereas the incus originated from the quadrate bone.\nThis arrangement of jaw and ear bones aids in distinguishing fossil mammals from fossils of other synapsids.\nFigure 29.37 Mammalian ear bones. Bones of the mammalian middle ear are modified from bones of the jaw and skull in reptiles. The\nstapes is found in other vertebrates (e.g., the columella of birds) whereas in mammals, the malleus and incus are derived from the articular\nand quadrate bones, respectively. (credit: NCI)\nThe adductor muscles that close the jaw comprise two major muscles in mammals: the temporalis and the masseter. Working\ntogether, these muscles permit up-and-down and side-to-side movements of the jaw, making chewing possible\u2014which is\nunique to mammals. Most mammals have heterodont teeth, meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth\n(incisors, canines, premolars, and molars) rather than just one type and shape of tooth. Most mammals are also diphyodonts,\nmeaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: deciduous or \u201cbaby\u201d teeth, and permanent teeth. Most other\nvertebrates with teeth are polyphyodonts, that is, their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life.\nMammals, like birds, possess a four-chambered heart; however, the hearts of birds and mammals are an example of convergent\n29.6 \u2022 Mammals\n811\nevolution, since mammals clearly arose independently from different groups of tetrapod ancestors. Mammals also have a\nspecialized group of cardiac cells (fibers) located in the walls of their right atrium called the sinoatrial node, or pacemaker,\nwhich determines the rate at which the heart beats. Mammalian erythrocytes (red blood cells) do not have nuclei, whereas the\nerythrocytes of other vertebrates are nucleated.\nThe kidneys of mammals have a portion of the nephron called the loop of Henle or nephritic loop, which allows mammals to\nproduce urine with a high concentration of solutes\u2014higher than that of the blood. Mammals lack a renal portal system, which is\na system of veins that moves blood from the hind or lower limbs and region of the tail to the kidneys. Renal portal systems are\npresent in all other vertebrates except jawless fishes. A urinary bladder is present in all mammals.\nUnlike birds, the skulls of mammals have two occipital condyles, bones at the base of the skull that articulate with the first\nvertebra, as well as a secondary palate at the rear of the pharynx that helps to separate the pathway of swallowing from that of\nbreathing. Turbinate bones (chonchae in humans) are located along the sides of the nasal cavity, and help warm and moisten air\nas it is inhaled. The pelvic bones are fused in mammals, and there are typically seven cervical vertebrae (except for some\nedentates and manatees). Mammals have movable eyelids and fleshy external ears (pinnae), quite unlike the naked external\nauditory openings of birds. Mammals also have a muscular diaphragm that is lacking in birds.\nMammalian brains also have certain characteristics that differ from the brains of other vertebrates. In some, but not all\nmammals, the cerebral cortex, the outermost part of the cerebrum, is highly convoluted and folded, allowing for a greater\nsurface area than is possible with a smooth cortex. The optic lobes, located in the midbrain, are divided into two parts in\nmammals, while other vertebrates possess a single, undivided lobe. Eutherian mammals also possess a specialized structure,\nthe corpus callosum, which links the two cerebral hemispheres together. The corpus callosum functions to integrate motor,\nsensory, and cognitive functions between the left and right cerebral cortexes.\nEvolution of Mammals\nMammals are synapsids, meaning they have a single, ancestrally fused, postorbital opening in the skull. They are the only living\nsynapsids, as earlier forms became extinct by the Jurassic period. The early non-mammalian synapsids can be divided into two\ngroups, the pelycosaurs and the therapsids. Within the therapsids, a group called the cynodonts are thought to have been the\nancestors of mammals (Figure 29.38).\nFigure 29.38 Cynodont. Cynodonts (\"dog teeth\"), which first appeared in the Late Permian period 260 million years ago, are thought to be\nthe ancestors of modern mammals. Holes in the upper jaws of cynodonts suggest that they had whiskers, which might also indicate the\npresence of hair. (credit: Nobu Tamura)\nAs with birds, a key characteristic of synapsids is endothermy, rather than the ectothermy seen in many other vertebrates (such\nas fish, amphibians, and most reptiles). The increased metabolic rate required to internally modify body temperature likely went\nhand-in-hand with changes to certain skeletal structures that improved food processing and ambulation. The later synapsids,\nwhich had more evolved characteristics unique to mammals, possess cheeks for holding food and heterodont teeth, which are\nspecialized for chewing, mechanically breaking down food to speed digestion, and releasing the energy needed to produce heat.\nChewing also requires the ability to breathe at the same time, which is facilitated by the presence of a secondary palate\n(comprising the bony palate and the posterior continuation of the soft palate). The secondary palate separates the area of the\nmouth where chewing occurs from the area above where respiration occurs, allowing breathing to proceed uninterrupted while\nthe animal is chewing. A secondary palate is not found in pelycosaurs but is present in cynodonts and mammals. The jawbone\nalso shows changes from early synapsids to later ones. The zygomatic arch, or cheekbone, is present in mammals and advanced\ntherapsids such as cynodonts, but is not present in pelycosaurs. The presence of the zygomatic arch suggests the presence of\n812\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nmasseter muscles, which close the jaw and function in chewing.\nIn the appendicular skeleton, the shoulder girdle of therian mammals is modified from that of other vertebrates in that it does\nnot possess a procoracoid bone or an interclavicle, and the scapula is the dominant bone.\nMammals evolved from therapsids in the late Triassic period, as the earliest known mammal fossils are from the early Jurassic\nperiod, some 205 million years ago. One group of transitional mammals was the morganucodonts, small nocturnal insectivores.\nThe jaws of morganucodonts were \u201ctransitional,\u201d with features of both reptilian and mammalian jaws (Figure 29.39). Like\nmodern mammals, the morganucodonts had differentiated teeth and were diphyodonts. Mammals first began to diversify in the\nMesozoic era, from the Jurassic to the Cretaceous periods. Even some small gliding mammals appear in the fossil record during\nthis time period. However, most of the Jurassic mammals were extinct by the end of the Mesozoic. During the Cretaceous\nperiod, another radiation of mammals began and continued through the Cenozoic era, about 65 million years ago.\nFigure 29.39 A morganucodont. This morganucodont Megazotrodon, an extinct basal mammal, may have been nocturnal and insectivorous.\nInset: Jaw of a morganucodont, showing a double hinge, one between the dentary and squamosal and one between the articular (yellow)\nand quadrate (blue) bones.

Credit inset: Mod from Philcha. https://commons.wikimedia.org/\nw/index.php? curid=3631949 (http://openstax.org/l/jaw_joint) )\nLiving Mammals\nThere are three major groups of living mammals: monotremes (prototheria), marsupials (metatheria), and placental (eutheria)\nmammals. The eutherians and the marsupials together comprise a clade of therian mammals, with the monotremes forming a\nsister clade to both metatherians and eutherians.\nThere are very few living species of monotremes: the platypus and four species of echidnas, or spiny anteaters. The leathery-\nbeaked platypus belongs to the family Ornithorhynchidae (\u201cbird beak\u201d), whereas echidnas belong to the family Tachyglossidae\n(\u201csticky tongue\u201d) (Figure 29.40). The platypus and one species of echidna are found in Australia, and the other species of echidna\nare found in New Guinea. Monotremes are unique among mammals because they lay eggs, rather than giving birth to live\nyoung. The shells of their eggs are not like the hard shells of birds, but have a leathery shell, similar to the shells of reptile eggs.\nMonotremes retain their eggs through about two-thirds of the developmental period, and then lay them in nests. A yolk-sac\nplacenta helps support development. The babies hatch in a fetal state and complete their development in the nest, nourished by\nmilk secreted by mammary glands opening directly to the skin. Monotremes, except for young platypuses, do not have teeth.\nBody temperature in the three monotreme species is maintained at about 30\u00b0C, considerably lower than the average body\ntemperature of marsupial and placental mammals, which are typically between 35 and 38\u00b0C.\n29.6 \u2022 Mammals\n813\nFigure 29.40 Egg-laying mammals. (a) The platypus, a monotreme, possesses a leathery beak and lays eggs rather than giving birth to live\nyoung. (b) The echidna is another monotreme, with long hairs modified into spines. (credit b: modification of work by Barry Thomas)\nOver 2/3 of the approximately 330 living species of marsupials are found in Australia, with the rest, nearly all various types of\nopossum, found in the Americas, especially South America. Australian marsupials include the kangaroo, koala, bandicoot,\nTasmanian devil (Figure 29.41), and several other species. Like monotremes, the embryos of marsupials are nourished during a\nshort gestational period (about a month in kangaroos) by a yolk-sac placenta, but with no intervening egg shell. Some marsupial\nembryos can enter an embryonic diapause, and delay implantation, suspending development until implantation is completed.\nMarsupial young are also effectively fetal at birth. Most, but not all, species of marsupials possess a pouch in which the very\npremature young reside, receiving milk and continuing their development. In kangaroos, the young joeys continue to nurse for\nabout a year and a half.\nFigure 29.41 A marsupial mammal. The Tasmanian devil is one of several marsupials native to Australia. (credit: Wayne McLean)\nEutherians (placentals) are the most widespread and numerous of the mammals, occurring throughout the world. Eutherian\nmammals are sometimes called \u201cplacental mammals\u201d because all species possess a complex chorioallantoic placenta that\nconnects a fetus to the mother, allowing for gas, fluid, and nutrient exchange. There are about 4,000 species of placental\nmammals in 18 to 20 orders with various adaptations for burrowing, flying, swimming, hunting, running, and climbing. In the\nevolutionary sense, they have been incredibly successful in form, diversity, and abundance. The eutherian mammals are\nclassified in two major clades, the Atlantogenata and the Boreoeutheria. The Atlantogeneta include the Afrotheria (e.g.,\nelephants, hyraxes, and manatees) and the Xenarthra (anteaters, armadillos, and sloths). The Boreoeutheria contain two large\ngroups, the Euarchontoglires and the Laurasiatheria. Familiar orders in the Euarchontoglires are the Scandentia (tree shrews),\nRodentia (rats, mice, squirrels, porcupines), Lagomorpha (rabbits and hares), and the Primates (including humans). Major\nLaurasiatherian orders include the Perissodactyla (e.g., horses and rhinos), the Cetartiodactyla (e.g., cows, giraffes, pigs,\nhippos, and whales), the Carnivora (e.g., cats, dogs, and bears), and the Chiroptera (bats and flying foxes). The two largest\norders are the rodents (2,000 species) and bats (about 1,000 species), which together constitute approximately 60 percent of all\neutherian species.\n29.7 The Evolution of Primates\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the derived features that distinguish primates from other animals\n\u2022\nDescribe the defining features of the major groups of primates\n\u2022\nIdentify the major hominin precursors to modern humans\n\u2022\nExplain why scientists are having difficulty determining the true lines of descent in hominids\nOrder Primates of class Mammalia includes lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans. Non-human primates live primarily\n814\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nin the tropical or subtropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia. They range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1\nounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds). The characteristics and evolution of primates are of particular\ninterest to us as they allow us to understand the evolution of our own species.\nCharacteristics of Primates\nAll primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers. This arboreal heritage of\nprimates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for climbing, or brachiation (swinging through trees using the arms).\nThese adaptations include, but are not limited to: 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other\ntoes (except humans) and thumbs sufficiently separated from fingers to allow for gripping branches, and 3) stereoscopic vision,\ntwo overlapping fields of vision from the eyes, which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance. Other\ncharacteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals, claws that have been modified into\nflattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a trend toward holding the body upright.\nOrder Primates is divided into two groups: Strepsirrhini (\u201cturned-nosed\u201d) and Haplorhini (\u201csimple-nosed\u201d) primates.\nStrepsirrhines, also called the wet-nosed primates, include prosimians like the bush babies and pottos of Africa, the lemurs of\nMadagascar, and the lorises of Southeast Asia. Haplorhines, or dry-nosed primates, include tarsiers (Figure 29.42) and simians\n(New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans). In general, strepsirrhines tend to be nocturnal, have larger\nolfactory centers in the brain, and exhibit a smaller size and smaller brain than anthropoids. Haplorhines, with a few\nexceptions, are diurnal, and depend more on their vision. Another interesting difference between the strepsirrhines and\nhaplorhines is that strepsirrhines have the enzymes for making vitamin C, while haplorhines have to get it from their food.\nFigure 29.42 A Philippine tarsier. This tarsier, Carlito syrichta, is one of the smallest primates\u2014about 5 inches long, from nose to the base of\nthe tail. The tail is not shown, but is about twice the length of the body. Note the large eyes, each of which is about the same size as the\nanimal's brain, and the long hind legs.

They were roughly similar to squirrels and tree shrews in size\nand appearance. The existing fossil evidence (mostly from North Africa) is very fragmented. These proto-primates remain\nlargely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available. Although genetic evidence suggests that primates\ndiverged from other mammals about 85 MYA, the oldest known primate-like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record date\nto about 65 MYA. Fossils like the proto-primate Plesiadapis (although some researchers do not agree that Plesiadapis was a\nproto-primate) had some features of the teeth and skeleton in common with true primates. They were found in North America\nand Europe in the Cenozoic and went extinct by the end of the Eocene.\nThe first true primates date to about 55 MYA in the Eocene epoch. They were found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.\nThese early primates resembled present-day prosimians such as lemurs. Evolutionary changes continued in these early\n29.7 \u2022 The Evolution of Primates\n815\nprimates, with larger brains and eyes, and smaller muzzles being the trend. By the end of the Eocene epoch, many of the early\nprosimian species went extinct due either to cooler temperatures or competition from the first monkeys.\nAnthropoid monkeys evolved from prosimians during the Oligocene epoch. By 40 million years ago, evidence indicates that\nmonkeys were present in the New World (South America) and the Old World (Africa and Asia). New World monkeys are also\ncalled Platyrrhini\u2014a reference to their broad noses (Figure 29.43). Old World monkeys are called Catarrhini\u2014a reference to\ntheir narrow, downward-pointed noses. There is still quite a bit of uncertainty about the origins of the New World monkeys. At\nthe time the platyrrhines arose, the continents of South American and Africa had drifted apart. Therefore, it is thought that\nmonkeys arose in the Old World and reached the New World either by drifting on log rafts or by crossing land bridges. Due to\nthis reproductive isolation, New World monkeys and Old World monkeys underwent separate adaptive radiations over millions\nof years. The New World monkeys are all arboreal, whereas Old World monkeys include both arboreal and ground-dwelling\nspecies. The arboreal habits of the New World monkeys are reflected in the possession of prehensile or grasping tails by most\nspecies. The tails of Old World monkeys are never prehensile and are often reduced, and some species have ischial\ncallosities\u2014thickened patches of skin on their seats.\nFigure 29.43 A New World monkey. The howler monkey is native to Central and South America. It makes a call that sounds like a lion\nroaring. (credit: Xavi Talleda)\nApes evolved from the catarrhines in Africa midway through the Cenozoic, approximately 25 million years ago. Apes are\ngenerally larger than monkeys and they do not possess a tail. All apes are capable of moving through trees, although many\nspecies spend most their time on the ground. When walking quadrupedally, monkeys walk on their palms, while apes support\nthe upper body on their knuckles. Apes are more intelligent than monkeys, and they have larger brains relative to body size. The\napes are divided into two groups. The lesser apes comprise the family Hylobatidae, including gibbons and siamangs. The great\napes include the genera Pan (chimpanzees and bonobos) Gorilla (gorillas), Pongo (orangutans), and Homo (humans) (Figure\n29.44).\nFigure 29.44 Primate skeletons. All great apes have a similar skeletal structure. (credit: modification of work by Tim Vickers)\n816\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe very arboreal gibbons are smaller than the great apes; they have low sexual dimorphism (that is, the sexes are not markedly\ndifferent in size), although in some species, the sexes differ in color; and they have relatively longer arms used for swinging\nthrough trees (Figure 29.45a). Two species of orangutan are native to different islands in Indonesia: Borneo (P. pygmaeus) and\nSumatra (P. abelii). A third orangutan species, Pongo tapanuliensis, was reported in 2017 from the Batang Toru forest in\nSumatra. Orangutans are arboreal and solitary. Males are much larger than females and have cheek and throat pouches when\nmature. Gorillas all live in Central Africa. The eastern and western populations are recognized as separate species, G. berengei\nand G. gorilla. Gorillas are strongly sexually dimorphic, with males about twice the size of females. In older males, called\nsilverbacks, the hair on the back turns white or gray. Chimpanzees (Figure 29.45b) are the species considered to be most closely\nrelated to humans. However, the species most closely related to the chimpanzee is the bonobo. Genetic evidence suggests that\nchimpanzee and human lineages separated 5 to 7 MYA, while chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and bonobo (Pan paniscus) lineages\nseparated about 2 MYA. Chimpanzees and bonobos both live in Central Africa, but the two species are separated by the Congo\nRiver, a significant geographic barrier. Bonobos are slighter than chimpanzees, but have longer legs and more hair on their\nheads. In chimpanzees, white tail tufts identify juveniles, while bonobos keep their white tail tufts for life. Bonobos also have\nhigher-pitched voices than chimpanzees. Chimpanzees are more aggressive and sometimes kill animals from other groups,\nwhile bonobos are not known to do so. Both chimpanzees and bonobos are omnivorous. Orangutan and gorilla diets also include\nfoods from multiple sources, although the predominant food items are fruits for orangutans and foliage for gorillas.\nFigure 29.45 Lesser and great apes. This white-cheeked gibbon (a) is a lesser ape. In gibbons of this species, females and infants are buff\nand males are black. This young chimpanzee (b) is one of the great apes. It possesses a relatively large brain and has no tail.

Evidence from the\nfossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee DNA suggests that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a\ncommon hominoid ancestor approximately six million years ago. Several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that\nincludes humans, although our species is the only surviving member. The term hominin is used to refer to those species that\nevolved after this split of the primate line, thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to\nchimpanzees. A number of marker features differentiate humans from the other hominoids, including bipedalism or upright\nposture, increase in the size of the brain, and a fully opposable thumb that can touch the little finger. Bipedal hominins include\nseveral groups that were probably part of the modern human lineage\u2014Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo\nerectus\u2014and several non-ancestral groups that can be considered \u201ccousins\u201d of modern humans, such as Neanderthals and\nDenisovans.\nDetermining the true lines of descent in hominins is difficult. In years past, when relatively few hominin fossils had been\nrecovered, some scientists believed that considering them in order, from oldest to youngest, would demonstrate the course of\nevolution from early hominins to modern humans. In the past several years, however, many new fossils have been found, and it\nis clear that there was often more than one species alive at any one time and that many of the fossils found (and species named)\nrepresent hominin species that died out and are not ancestral to modern humans.\n29.7 \u2022 The Evolution of Primates\n817\nFigure 29.46 Hominin phylogeny. This chart shows evolutionary relationship among Hominins and hypothesized relation to modern\nhumans. (*still debated phylogeny position).\nVery Early Hominins\nThree species of very early hominids have made news in the late 20th and early 21st centuries: Ardipithecus, Sahelanthropus,\nand Orrorin. The youngest of the three species, Ardipithecus, was discovered in the 1990s, and dates to about 4.4 MYA. Although\nthe bipedality of the early specimens was uncertain, several more specimens of Ardipithecus were discovered in the intervening\nyears and demonstrated that the organism was bipedal. Two different species of Ardipithecus have been identified, A. ramidus\nand A. kadabba, whose specimens are older, dating to 5.6 MYA. However, the status of this genus as a human ancestor is\nuncertain.\nThe oldest of the three, Sahelanthropus tchadensis, was discovered in 2001-2002 and has been dated to nearly seven million\nyears ago. There is a single specimen of this genus, a skull that was a surface find in Chad. The fossil, informally called \u201cToumai,\u201d\nis a mosaic of primitive and evolved characteristics, and it is unclear how this fossil fits with the picture given by molecular data,\nnamely that the line leading to modern humans and modern chimpanzees apparently bifurcated about six million years ago. It\nis not thought at this time that this species was an ancestor of modern humans.\nA younger (c. 6 MYA) species, Orrorin tugenensis, is also a relatively recent discovery, found in 2000. There are several\nspecimens of Orrorin. Some features of Orrorin are more similar to those of modern humans than are the australopithicenes,\nalthough Orrorin is much older. If Orrorin is a human ancestor, then the australopithicenes may not be in the direct human\nlineage. Additional specimens of these species may help to clarify their role.\nEarly Hominins: Genus Australopithecus\nAustralopithecus (\u201csouthern ape\u201d) is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern Africa approximately four million years ago and\nwent extinct about two million years ago. This genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus, genus Homo,\n818\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nevolved from a common ancestor shared with Australopithecus about two million years ago (after likely passing through some\ntransitional states). Australopithecus had a number of characteristics that were more similar to the great apes than to modern\nhumans. For example, sexual dimorphism was more exaggerated than in modern humans. Males were up to 50 percent larger\nthan females, a ratio that is similar to that seen in modern gorillas and orangutans. In contrast, modern human males are\napproximately 15 to 20 percent larger than females. The brain size of Australopithecus relative to its body mass was also smaller\nthan in modern humans and more similar to that seen in the great apes. A key feature that Australopithecus had in common\nwith modern humans was bipedalism, although it is likely that Australopithecus also spent time in trees. Hominin footprints,\nsimilar to those of modern humans, were found in Laetoli, Tanzania and dated to 3.6 million years ago. They showed that\nhominins at the time of Australopithecus were walking upright.\nThere were a number of Australopithecus species, which are often referred to as australopiths. Australopithecus anamensis lived\nabout 4.2 million years ago. More is known about another early species, Australopithecus afarensis, which lived between 3.9 and\n2.9 million years ago. This species demonstrates a trend in human evolution: the reduction of the dentition and jaw in size. A.\nafarensis (Figure 29.47a) had smaller canines and molars compared to apes, but these were larger than those of modern\nhumans. Its brain size was 380 to 450 cubic centimeters, approximately the size of a modern chimpanzee brain. It also had\nprognathic jaws, which is a relatively longer jaw than that of modern humans. In the mid-1970s, the fossil of an adult female A.\nafarensis was found in the Afar region of Ethiopia and dated to 3.24 million years ago (Figure 29.48). The fossil, which is\ninformally called \u201cLucy,\u201d is significant because it was the most complete australopith fossil found, with 40 percent of the skeleton\nrecovered.\nFigure 29.47 Australopithicene and modern human skulls. The skull of (a) Australopithecus afarensis, an early hominid that lived between\ntwo and three million years ago, resembled that of (b) modern humans but was smaller with a sloped forehead, larger teeth, and a\nprominent jaw.\n29.7 \u2022 The Evolution of Primates\n819\nFigure 29.48 Lucy. This adult female Australopithecus afarensis skeleton, nicknamed Lucy, was discovered in the mid-1970s. (credit:\n\u201c120\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nAustralopithecus africanus lived between two and three million years ago. It had a slender build and was bipedal, but had robust\narm bones and, like other early hominids, may have spent significant time in trees. Its brain was larger than that of A. afarensis\nat 500 cubic centimeters, which is slightly less than one-third the size of modern human brains. Two other species,\nAustralopithecus bahrelghazali and Australopithecus garhi, have been added to the roster of australopiths in recent years. A.\nbahrelghazali is unusual in being the only australopith found in Central Africa.\nA Dead End: Genus Paranthropus\nThe australopiths had a relatively slender build and teeth that were suited for soft food. In the past several years, fossils of\nhominids of a different body type have been found and dated to approximately 2.5 million years ago. These hominids, of the\ngenus Paranthropus, were muscular, stood 1.3 to 1.4 meters tall, and had large grinding teeth. Their molars showed heavy wear,\nsuggesting that they had a coarse and fibrous vegetarian diet as opposed to the partially carnivorous diet of the australopiths.\nParanthropus includes Paranthropus robustus of South Africa, and Paranthropus aethiopicus and Paranthropus boisei of East\nAfrica. The hominids in this genus went extinct more than one million years ago and are not thought to be ancestral to modern\nhumans, but rather members of an evolutionary branch on the hominin tree that left no descendants.\nEarly Hominins: Genus Homo\nThe human genus, Homo, first appeared between 2.5 and three million years ago. For many years, fossils of a species called H.\nhabilis were the oldest examples in the genus Homo, but in 2010, a new species called Homo gautengensis was discovered and\nmay be older. Compared to A. africanus, H. habilis had a number of features more similar to modern humans. H. habilis had a\njaw that was less prognathic than the australopiths and a larger brain, at 600 to 750 cubic centimeters. However, H. habilis\nretained some features of older hominin species, such as long arms. The name H. habilis means \u201chandy man,\u201d which is a\nreference to the stone tools that have been found with its remains.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video about Smithsonian paleontologist Briana Pobiner explaining the link between hominin eating of meat and\nevolutionary trends.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/diet_detective)\n820\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nH. erectus appeared approximately 1.8 million years ago (Figure 29.49). It is believed to have originated in East Africa and was\nthe first hominin species to migrate out of Africa. Fossils of H. erectus have been found in India, China, Java, and Europe, and\nwere known in the past as \u201cJava Man\u201d or \u201cPeking Man.\u201d H. erectus had a number of features that were more similar to modern\nhumans than those of H. habilis. H. erectus was larger in size than earlier hominins, reaching heights up to 1.85 meters and\nweighing up to 65 kilograms, which are sizes similar to those of modern humans. Its degree of sexual dimorphism was less than\nin earlier species, with males being 20 to 30 percent larger than females, which is close to the size difference seen in our own\nspecies. H. erectus had a larger brain than earlier species at 775 to 1,100 cubic centimeters, which compares to the 1,130 to 1,260\ncubic centimeters seen in modern human brains. H. erectus also had a nose with downward-facing nostrils similar to modern\nhumans, rather than the forward-facing nostrils found in other primates. Longer, downward-facing nostrils allow for the\nwarming of cold air before it enters the lungs and may have been an adaptation to colder climates. Artifacts found with fossils of\nH. erectus suggest that it was the first hominin to use fire, hunt, and have a home base. H. erectus is generally thought to have\nlived until about 50,000 years ago.\nFigure 29.49 Homo erectus. Homo erectus had a prominent brow and a nose that pointed downward rather than forward.\nHumans: Homo sapiens\nA number of species, sometimes called archaic Homo sapiens, apparently evolved from H. erectus starting about 500,000 years\nago. These species include Homo heidelbergensis, Homo rhodesiensis, and Homo neanderthalensis. These archaic H. sapiens\nhad a brain size similar to that of modern humans, averaging 1,200 to 1,400 cubic centimeters. They differed from modern\nhumans by having a thick skull, a prominent brow ridge, and a receding chin. Some of these species survived until 30,000 to\n10,000 years ago, overlapping with modern humans (Figure 29.50).\n29.7 \u2022 The Evolution of Primates\n821\nFigure 29.50 Neanderthal. The Homo neanderthalensis used tools and may have worn clothing.\nThere is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or Homo sapiens sapiens. As discussed earlier,\nH. erectus migrated out of Africa and into Asia and Europe in the first major wave of migration about 1.5 million years ago. It is\nthought that modern humans arose in Africa from H. erectus and migrated out of Africa about 100,000 years ago in a second\nmajor migration wave. Then, modern humans replaced H. erectus species that had migrated into Asia and Europe in the first\nwave.\nThis evolutionary timeline is supported by molecular evidence. One approach to studying the origins of modern humans is to\nexamine mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from populations around the world. Because a fetus develops from an egg containing its\nmother\u2019s mitochondria (which have their own, non-nuclear DNA), mtDNA is passed entirely through the maternal line.\nMutations in mtDNA can now be used to estimate the timeline of genetic divergence. The resulting evidence suggests that all\nmodern humans have mtDNA inherited from a common ancestor that lived in Africa about 160,000 years ago. Another approach\nto the molecular understanding of human evolution is to examine the Y chromosome, which is passed from father to son. This\nevidence suggests that all men today inherited a Y chromosome from a male that lived in Africa about 140,000 years ago.\nThe study of mitochondrial DNA led to the identification of another human species or subspecies, the Denisovans. DNA from\nteeth and finger bones suggested two things. First, the mitochondrial DNA was different from that of both modern humans and\nNeanderthals. Second, the genomic DNA suggested that the Denisovans shared a common ancestor with the Neanderthals.\nGenes from both Neanderthals and Denisovans have been identified in modern human populations, indicating that\ninterbreeding among the three groups occurred over part of their range.\n822\nChapter 29 \u2022 Vertebrates\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nAcanthostega\none of the earliest known tetrapods\nActinopterygii\nray-finned fishes\nallantois\nmembrane of the egg that stores nitrogenous\nwastes produced by the embryo;

Chordata contains two clades of\ninvertebrates: Urochordata (tunicates) and Cephalochordata\n(lancelets), together with the vertebrates in the Vertebrata/\nCraniata. Lancelets are suspension feeders that feed on\nphytoplankton and other microorganisms. Most tunicates\nlive on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders. Which of\nthe two invertebrate chordate clades is more closely related\nto the vertebrates continues to be debated. Vertebrata is\nnamed for the vertebral column, which is a feature of almost\nall members of this clade. The name Craniata (organisms\nwith a cranium) is considered to be synonymous with\nVertebrata.\n29.2 Fishes\nThe earliest vertebrates that diverged from the invertebrate\nchordates were the agnathan jawless fishes, whose extant\nmembers include the hagfishes and lampreys. Hagfishes are\neel-like scavengers that feed on dead invertebrates and other\nfishes. Lampreys are characterized by a toothed, funnel-like\nsucking mouth, and most species are parasitic or predaceous\non other fishes. Fishes with jaws (gnathostomes) evolved\nlater. Jaws allowed early gnathostomes to exploit new food\nsources.\nGnathostomes include the cartilaginous fishes and the bony\nfishes, as well as all other tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles,\nmammals). Cartilaginous fishes include sharks, rays, skates,\nand ghost sharks. Most cartilaginous fishes live in marine\nhabitats, with a few species living in fresh water for part or\nall of their lives. The vast majority of present-day fishes\nbelong to the clade Osteichthyes, which consists of\napproximately 30,000 species. Bony fishes (Osteichthyes) can\nbe divided into two clades: Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes,\nvirtually all extant species) and Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned\nfishes, comprising fewer than 10 extant species, but form the\nsister group of the tetrapods).\n29.3 Amphibians\nAs tetrapods, most amphibians are characterized by four\nwell-developed limbs, although some species of salamanders\nand all caecilians are limbless. The most important\n824\nChapter 29 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncharacteristic of extant amphibians is a moist, permeable\nskin used for cutaneous respiration, although lungs are\nfound in the adults of many species.\nAll amphibians are carnivores and possess many small teeth.\nThe fossil record provides evidence of amphibian species,\nnow extinct, that arose over 400 million years ago as the first\ntetrapods. Living Amphibia can be divided into three classes:\nsalamanders (Urodela), frogs (Anura), and caecilians\n(Apoda). In the majority of amphibians, development occurs\nin two distinct stages: a gilled aquatic larval stage that\nmetamorphoses into an adult stage, acquiring lungs and\nlegs, and losing the tail in Anurans. A few species in all three\nclades bypass a free-living larval stage. Various levels of\nparental care are seen in the amphibians.\n29.4 Reptiles\nThe amniotes are distinguished from amphibians by the\npresence of a terrestrially adapted egg protected by four\nextra-embryonic membranes. The amniotes include reptiles,\nbirds, and mammals. The early amniotes diverged into two\nmain lines soon after the first amniotes arose. The initial\nsplit was into synapsids (mammals) and sauropsids.\nSauropsids can be further divided into anapsids and diapsids\n(crocodiles, dinosaurs, birds, and modern reptiles).\nReptiles are tetrapods that ancestrally had four limbs;\nhowever, a number of extant species have secondarily lost\nthem or greatly reduced them over evolutionary time. For\nexample, limbless reptiles (e.g., snakes) are classified as\ntetrapods, because they descended from ancestors with four\nlimbs. One of the key adaptations that permitted reptiles to\nlive on land was the development of scaly skin containing the\nprotein keratin, which prevented water loss from the skin.\nReptilia includes four living clades of nonavian organisms:\nCrocodilia (crocodiles and alligators), Sphenodontia\n(tuataras), Squamata (lizards and snakes), and Testudines\n(turtles). Currently, this classification is paraphyletic, leaving\nout the birds, which are now classified as avian reptiles in the\nclass Reptilia.\n29.5 Birds\nBirds are the most speciose group of land vertebrates and\ndisplay a number of adaptations related to their ability to fly,\nwhich were first present in their theropod (maniraptoran)\nancestors. Birds are endothermic (and homeothermic),\nmeaning they have a very high metabolism that produces a\nconsiderable amount of heat, as well as structures such as\nfeathers that allow them to retain their own body heat. These\nadaptations are used to regulate their internal temperature,\nmaking it largely independent of ambient thermal\nconditions.\nBirds have feathers, which allow for insulation and flight, as\nwell as for mating and warning signals. Flight feathers have a\nbroad and continuously curved vane that produces lift. Some\nbirds have pneumatic bones containing air spaces that are\nsometimes connected to air sacs in the body cavity. Airflow\nthrough bird lungs travels in one direction, creating a\ncounter-current gas exchange with the blood.\nBirds are highly modified diapsids and belong to a group\ncalled the archosaurs. Within the archosaurs, birds are most\nlikely evolved from theropod (maniraptoran) dinosaurs. One\nof the oldest known fossils (and best known) of a \u201cdinosaur-\nbird\u201d is that of Archaeopteryx, which is dated from the\nJurassic period. Modern birds are now classified into three\ngroups: Paleognathae, Galloanserae, and Neoaves.\n29.6 Mammals\nMammals are vertebrates that possess hair and mammary\nglands. The mammalian integument includes various\nsecretory glands, including sebaceous glands, eccrine\nglands, apocrine glands, and mammary glands.\nMammals are synapsids, meaning that they have a single\nopening in the skull behind the eye. Mammals probably\nevolved from therapsids in the late Triassic period, as the\nearliest known mammal fossils are from the early Jurassic\nperiod. A key characteristic of synapsids is endothermy, and\nmost mammals are homeothermic.\nThere are three groups of mammals living today:\nmonotremes, marsupials, and eutherians. Monotremes are\nunique among mammals as they lay eggs, rather than giving\nbirth to young. Marsupials give birth to very immature\nyoung, which typically complete their development in a\npouch. Eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental\nmammals, because all species possess a complex placenta\nthat connects a fetus to the mother, allowing for gas, fluid,\nand nutrient exchange. All mammals nourish their young\nwith milk, which is derived from modified sweat or\nsebaceous glands.\n29.7 The Evolution of Primates\nAll primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees\nand probably descended from arboreal ancestors, although\nnot all living species are arboreal. Other characteristics of\nprimates are brains that are larger, relative to body size, than\nthose of other mammals, claws that have been modified into\nflattened nails, typically only one young per pregnancy,\nstereoscopic vision, and a trend toward holding the body\nupright. Primates are divided into two groups:\nstrepsirrhines, which include most prosimians, and\nhaplorhines, which include simians. Monkeys evolved from\nprosimians during the Oligocene epoch.

(credit: modification of work by Todd Petit)\nINTRODUCTION Plants are as essential to human existence as land, water, and air. Without plants, our\nday-to-day lives would be impossible because without oxygen from photosynthesis, aerobic life cannot\nbe sustained. From providing food and shelter to serving as a source of medicines, oils, perfumes, and\nindustrial products, plants provide humans with numerous valuable resources.\nWhen you think of plants, most of the organisms that come to mind are vascular plants. These plants\nhave tissues that conduct food and water, and most of them have seeds. Seed plants are divided into\ngymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms include the needle-leaved conifers\u2014spruce, fir, and\npine\u2014as well as less familiar plants, such as ginkgos and cycads. Their seeds are not enclosed by a fleshy\nfruit. Angiosperms, also called flowering plants, constitute the majority of seed plants. They include\nbroadleaved trees (such as maple, oak, and elm), vegetables (such as potatoes, lettuce, and carrots),\ngrasses, and plants known for the beauty of their flowers (roses, irises, and daffodils, for example).\nWhile individual plant species are unique, all share a common structure: a plant body consisting of\nstems, roots, and leaves. They all transport water, minerals, and sugars produced through\nphotosynthesis through the plant body in a similar manner. All plant species also respond to\nenvironmental factors, such as light, gravity, competition, temperature, and predation.\nChapter Outline\n30.1 The Plant Body\n30.2 Stems\n30.3 Roots\n30.4 Leaves\n30.5 Transport of Water\nand Solutes in\nPlants\n30.6 Plant Sensory\nSystems and\nResponses\nanimals, however, plants use energy from sunlight to form sugars during photosynthesis. In addition, plant\ncells have cell walls, plastids, and a large central vacuole: structures that are not found in animal cells. Each\nof these cellular structures plays a specific role in plant structure and function.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch Botany Without Borders (http://openstax.org/l/botany_wo_bord) , a video produced by the Botanical\nSociety of America about the importance of plants.\nPlant Organ Systems\nIn plants, just as in animals, similar cells working together form a tissue. When different types of tissues\nwork together to perform a unique function, they form an organ; organs working together form organ\nsystems. Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems: a shoot system, and a root system. The shoot\nsystem consists of two portions: the vegetative (non-reproductive) parts of the plant, such as the leaves and\nthe stems, and the reproductive parts of the plant, which include flowers and fruits. The shoot system\ngenerally grows above ground, where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis. The root system, which\nsupports the plants and absorbs water and minerals, is usually underground. Figure 30.2 shows the organ\nsystems of a typical plant.\nFigure 30.2 The shoot system of a plant consists of leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The root system anchors the\nplant while absorbing water and minerals from the soil.\nPlant Tissues\nPlants are multicellular eukaryotes with tissue systems made of various cell types that carry out specific\nfunctions. Plant tissue systems fall into one of two general types: meristematic tissue, and permanent (or\nnon-meristematic) tissue. Cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems, which are plant regions\nof continuous cell division and growth. Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely\ndifferentiated, and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant. In contrast,\npermanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing.\nMeristematic tissues consist of three types, based on their location in the plant. Apical meristems contain\nmeristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots, which enable a plant to extend in length. Lateral\n830\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nmeristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant. Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots, at the\nbases of leaf blades and at nodes (the areas where leaves attach to a stem). This tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase\nin length from the leaf base; for example, it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing.\nMeristems produce cells that quickly differentiate, or specialize, and become permanent tissue. Such cells take on specific roles\nand lose their ability to divide further. They differentiate into three main types: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue. Dermal\ntissue covers and protects the plant, and vascular tissue transports water, minerals, and sugars to different parts of the plant.\nGround tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis, provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue, and helps to store water\nand sugars.\nSecondary tissues are either simple (composed of similar cell types) or complex (composed of different cell types). Dermal tissue,\nfor example, is a simple tissue that covers the outer surface of the plant and controls gas exchange. Vascular tissue is an example\nof a complex tissue, and is made of two specialized conducting tissues: xylem and phloem. Xylem tissue transports water and\nnutrients from the roots to different parts of the plant, and includes three different cell types: vessel elements and tracheids\n(both of which conduct water), and xylem parenchyma. Phloem tissue, which transports organic compounds from the site of\nphotosynthesis to other parts of the plant, consists of four different cell types: sieve cells (which conduct photosynthates),\ncompanion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers. Unlike xylem conducting cells, phloem conducting cells are alive at\nmaturity. The xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other (Figure 30.3). In stems, the xylem and the phloem form a\nstructure called a vascular bundle; in roots, this is termed the vascular stele or vascular cylinder.\nFigure 30.3 This light micrograph shows a cross section of a squash (Curcurbita maxima) stem. Each teardrop-shaped vascular bundle\nconsists of large xylem vessels toward the inside and smaller phloem cells toward the outside. Xylem cells, which transport water and\nnutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant, are dead at functional maturity. Phloem cells, which transport sugars and other organic\ncompounds from photosynthetic tissue to the rest of the plant, are living. The vascular bundles are encased in ground tissue and\nsurrounded by dermal tissue.

They may range in length from a few millimeters to hundreds of meters, and also\nvary in diameter, depending on the plant type. Stems are usually above ground, although the stems of some plants, such as the\npotato, also grow underground. Stems may be herbaceous (soft) or woody in nature. Their main function is to provide support to\n30.2 \u2022 Stems\n831\nthe plant, holding leaves, flowers and buds; in some cases, stems also store food for the plant. A stem may be unbranched, like\nthat of a palm tree, or it may be highly branched, like that of a magnolia tree. The stem of the plant connects the roots to the\nleaves, helping to transport absorbed water and minerals to different parts of the plant. It also helps to transport the products of\nphotosynthesis, namely sugars, from the leaves to the rest of the plant.\nPlant stems, whether above or below ground, are characterized by the presence of nodes and internodes (Figure 30.4). Nodes are\npoints of attachment for leaves, aerial roots, and flowers. The stem region between two nodes is called an internode. The stalk\nthat extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole. An axillary bud is usually found in the axil\u2014the area between the\nbase of a leaf and the stem\u2014where it can give rise to a branch or a flower. The apex (tip) of the shoot contains the apical\nmeristem within the apical bud.\nFigure 30.4 Leaves are attached to the plant stem at areas called nodes. An internode is the stem region between two nodes. The petiole is\nthe stalk connecting the leaf to the stem. The leaves just above the nodes arose from axillary buds.\nStem Anatomy\nThe stem and other plant organs arise from the ground tissue, and are primarily made up of simple tissues formed from three\ntypes of cells: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells.\nParenchyma cells are the most common plant cells (Figure 30.5). They are found in the stem, the root, the inside of the leaf, and\nthe pulp of the fruit. Parenchyma cells are responsible for metabolic functions, such as photosynthesis, and they help repair and\nheal wounds. Some parenchyma cells also store starch.\n832\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 30.5 The stem of common St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is shown in cross section in this light micrograph. The central pith\n(greenish-blue, in the center) and peripheral cortex (narrow zone 3\u20135 cells thick just inside the epidermis) are composed of parenchyma\ncells. Vascular tissue composed of xylem (red) and phloem tissue (green, between the xylem and cortex) surrounds the pith. (credit: Rolf-\nDieter Mueller)\nCollenchyma cells are elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls (Figure 30.6). They provide structural support, mainly to the\nstem and leaves. These cells are alive at maturity and are usually found below the epidermis. The \u201cstrings\u201d of a celery stalk are an\nexample of collenchyma cells.\nFigure 30.6 Collenchyma cell walls are uneven in thickness, as seen in this light micrograph. They provide support to plant structures.\n(credit: modification of work by Carl Szczerski; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nSclerenchyma cells also provide support to the plant, but unlike collenchyma cells, many of them are dead at maturity. There are\ntwo types of sclerenchyma cells: fibers and sclereids. Both types have secondary cell walls that are thickened with deposits of\nlignin, an organic compound that is a key component of wood. Fibers are long, slender cells; sclereids are smaller-sized.\nSclereids give pears their gritty texture. Humans use sclerenchyma fibers to make linen and rope (Figure 30.7).\n30.2 \u2022 Stems\n833\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 30.7 The central pith and outer cortex of the (a) flax stem are made up of parenchyma cells.

Each is distinguished by\ncharacteristic cell types that perform specific tasks necessary for the plant\u2019s growth and survival.\nDermal Tissue\nThe dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis, a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying\ntissue. Woody plants have a tough, waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark, which further protects the\nplant from damage. Epidermal cells are the most numerous and least differentiated of the cells in the epidermis. The epidermis\nof a leaf also contains openings known as stomata, through which the exchange of gases takes place (Figure 30.8). Two cells,\nknown as guard cells, surround each leaf stoma, controlling its opening and closing and thus regulating the uptake of carbon\ndioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor. Trichomes are hair-like structures on the epidermal surface. They help to\nreduce transpiration (the loss of water by aboveground plant parts), increase solar reflectance, and store compounds that\ndefend the leaves against predation by herbivores.\n834\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 30.8 Openings called stomata (singular: stoma) allow a plant to take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor.

The (c) guard cells sit within the layer of epidermal cells. (credit a: modification of work by Louisa Howard, Rippel\nElectron Microscope Facility, Dartmouth College; credit b: modification of work by June Kwak, University of Maryland; scale-bar data from\nMatt Russell)\nVascular Tissue\nThe xylem and phloem that make up the vascular tissue of the stem are arranged in distinct strands called vascular bundles,\nwhich run up and down the length of the stem. When the stem is viewed in cross section, the vascular bundles of dicot stems are\narranged in a ring. In plants with stems that live for more than one year, the individual bundles grow together and produce the\ncharacteristic growth rings. In monocot stems, the vascular bundles are randomly scattered throughout the ground tissue\n(Figure 30.9).\nFigure 30.9 In (a) dicot stems, vascular bundles are arranged around the periphery of the ground tissue. The xylem tissue is located toward\nthe interior of the vascular bundle, and phloem is located toward the exterior. Sclerenchyma fibers cap the vascular bundles. In (b) monocot\nstems, vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem tissues are scattered throughout the ground tissue.\nXylem tissue has three types of cells: xylem parenchyma, tracheids, and vessel elements. The latter two types conduct water and\nare dead at maturity. Tracheids are xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are lignified. Water moves from one tracheid\nto another through regions on the side walls known as pits, where secondary walls are absent. Vessel elements are xylem cells\nwith thinner walls; they are shorter than tracheids. Each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a perforation plate\nat the end walls of the element. Water moves through the perforation plates to travel up the plant.\n30.2 \u2022 Stems\n835\nPhloem tissue is composed of sieve-tube cells, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers. A series of sieve-tube\ncells (also called sieve-tube elements) are arranged end to end to make up a long sieve tube, which transports organic substances\nsuch as sugars and amino acids. The sugars flow from one sieve-tube cell to the next through perforated sieve plates, which are\nfound at the end junctions between two cells. Although still alive at maturity, the nucleus and other cell components of the sieve-\ntube cells have disintegrated. Companion cells are found alongside the sieve-tube cells, providing them with metabolic support.\nThe companion cells contain more ribosomes and mitochondria than the sieve-tube cells, which lack some cellular organelles.\nGround Tissue\nGround tissue is mostly made up of parenchyma cells, but may also contain collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells that help\nsupport the stem. The ground tissue towards the interior of the vascular tissue in a stem or root is known as pith, while the layer\nof tissue between the vascular tissue and the epidermis is known as the cortex.\nGrowth in Stems\nGrowth in plants occurs as the stems and roots lengthen. Some plants, especially those that are woody, also increase in thickness\nduring their life span. The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth, and is the result of cell\ndivision in the shoot apical meristem. Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant, and is\ncaused by cell division in the lateral meristem. Figure 30.10 shows the areas of primary and secondary growth in a plant.\nHerbaceous plants mostly undergo primary growth, with hardly any secondary growth or increase in thickness. Secondary\ngrowth or \u201cwood\u201d is noticeable in woody plants; it occurs in some dicots, but occurs very rarely in monocots.\nFigure 30.10 In woody plants, primary growth is followed by secondary growth, which allows the plant stem to increase in thickness or\ngirth. Secondary vascular tissue is added as the plant grows, as well as a cork layer. The bark of a tree extends from the vascular cambium\nto the epidermis.\nSome plant parts, such as stems and roots, continue to grow throughout a plant\u2019s life: a phenomenon called indeterminate\ngrowth. Other plant parts, such as leaves and flowers, exhibit determinate growth, which ceases when a plant part reaches a\nparticular size.\nPrimary Growth\nMost primary growth occurs at the apices, or tips, of stems and roots. Primary growth is a result of rapidly dividing cells in the\napical meristems at the shoot tip and root tip. Subsequent cell elongation also contributes to primary growth. The growth of\nshoots and roots during primary growth enables plants to continuously seek water (roots) or sunlight (shoots).\nThe influence of the apical bud on overall plant growth is known as apical dominance, which diminishes the growth of axillary\nbuds that form along the sides of branches and stems. Most coniferous trees exhibit strong apical dominance, thus producing\n836\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthe typical conical Christmas tree shape. If the apical bud is removed, then the axillary buds will start forming lateral branches.\nGardeners make use of this fact when they prune plants by cutting off the tops of branches, thus encouraging the axillary buds\nto grow out, giving the plant a bushy shape.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this BBC Nature video (http://openstax.org/l/motion_plants) showing how time-lapse photography captures plant\ngrowth at high speed.\nSecondary Growth\nThe increase in stem thickness that results from secondary growth is due to the activity of the lateral meristems, which are\nlacking in herbaceous plants. Lateral meristems include the vascular cambium and, in woody plants, the cork cambium (see\nFigure 30.10). The vascular cambium is located just outside the primary xylem and to the interior of the primary phloem. The\ncells of the vascular cambium divide and form secondary xylem (tracheids and vessel elements) to the inside, and secondary\nphloem (sieve elements and companion cells) to the outside. The thickening of the stem that occurs in secondary growth is due\nto the formation of secondary phloem and secondary xylem by the vascular cambium, plus the action of cork cambium, which\nforms the tough outermost layer of the stem. The cells of the secondary xylem contain lignin, which provides hardiness and\nstrength.\nIn woody plants, cork cambium is the outermost lateral meristem. It produces cork cells (bark) containing a waxy substance\nknown as suberin that can repel water. The bark protects the plant against physical damage and helps reduce water loss. The\ncork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm, which grows inward from the cambium. The cork cambium,\ncork cells, and phelloderm are collectively termed the periderm. The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants. In\nsome plants, the periderm has many openings, known as lenticels, which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the\noutside atmosphere (Figure 30.11). This supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex, xylem, and\nphloem.\nFigure 30.11 Lenticels on the bark of this cherry tree enable the woody stem to exchange gases with the surrounding atmosphere. (credit:\nRoger Griffith)\nAnnual Rings\nThe activity of the vascular cambium gives rise to annual growth rings. During the spring growing season, cells of the secondary\nxylem have a large internal diameter and their primary cell walls are not extensively thickened. This is known as early wood, or\nspring wood. During the fall season, the secondary xylem develops thickened cell walls, forming late wood, or autumn wood,\nwhich is denser than early wood. This alternation of early and late wood is due largely to a seasonal decrease in the number of\n30.2 \u2022 Stems\n837\nvessel elements and a seasonal increase in the number of tracheids. It results in the formation of an annual ring, which can be\nseen as a circular ring in the cross section of the stem (Figure 30.12). An examination of the number of annual rings and their\nnature (such as their size and cell wall thickness) can reveal the age of the tree and the prevailing climatic conditions during each\nseason.\nFigure 30.12 The rate of wood growth increases in summer and decreases in winter, producing a characteristic ring for each year of growth.\nSeasonal changes in weather patterns can also affect the growth rate\u2014note how the rings vary in thickness. (credit: Adrian Pingstone)\nStem Modifications\nSome plant species have modified stems that are especially suited to a particular habitat and environment (Figure 30.13). A\nrhizome is a modified stem that grows horizontally underground and has nodes and internodes. Vertical shoots may arise from\nthe buds on the rhizome of some plants, such as ginger and ferns. Corms are similar to rhizomes, except they are more rounded\nand fleshy (such as in gladiolus). Corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter. Stolons are stems\nthat run almost parallel to the ground, or just below the surface, and can give rise to new plants at the nodes. Runners are a type\nof stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals: strawberries are an example.\nTubers are modified stems that may store starch, as seen in the potato (Solanum sp.). Tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons,\nand contain many adventitious or unusual buds (familiar to us as the \u201ceyes\u201d on potatoes). A bulb, which functions as an\nunderground storage unit, is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy leaves emerging from the stem\nor surrounding the base of the stem, as seen in the iris.\nFigure 30.13 Stem modifications enable plants to thrive in a variety of environments.

Some roots are modified to absorb moisture and\nexchange gases. Most roots are underground. Some plants, however, also have adventitious roots, which emerge above the\nground from the shoot.\nTypes of Root Systems\nRoot systems are mainly of two types (Figure 30.15). Dicots have a tap root system, while monocots have a fibrous root system. A\ntap root system has a main root that grows down vertically, and from which many smaller lateral roots arise. Dandelions are a\ngood example; their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these weeds, and they can regrow another shoot from the\nremaining root. A tap root system penetrates deep into the soil. In contrast, a fibrous root system is located closer to the soil\nsurface, and forms a dense network of roots that also helps prevent soil erosion (lawn grasses are a good example, as are wheat,\nrice, and corn). Some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots. Plants that grow in dry areas often have deep\nroot systems, whereas plants growing in areas with abundant water are likely to have shallower root systems.\n30.3 \u2022 Roots\n839\nFigure 30.15 (a) Tap root systems have a main root that grows down, while (b) fibrous root systems consist of many small roots. (credit b:\nmodification of work by \u201cAusten Squarepants\u201d/Flickr)\nRoot Growth and Anatomy\nRoot growth begins with seed germination. When the plant embryo emerges from the seed, the radicle of the embryo forms the\nroot system. The tip of the root is protected by the root cap, a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant structure.\nThe root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil. The root tip can be divided\ninto three zones: a zone of cell division, a zone of elongation, and a zone of maturation and differentiation (Figure 30.16). The\nzone of cell division is closest to the root tip; it is made up of the actively dividing cells of the root meristem. The zone of\nelongation is where the newly formed cells increase in length, thereby lengthening the root. Beginning at the first root hair is\nthe zone of cell maturation where the root cells begin to differentiate into special cell types. All three zones are in the first\ncentimeter or so of the root tip.\nFigure 30.16 A longitudinal view of the root reveals the zones of cell division, elongation, and maturation. Cell division occurs in the apical\nmeristem.\nThe root has an outer layer of cells called the epidermis, which surrounds areas of ground tissue and vascular tissue. The\n840\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nepidermis provides protection and helps in absorption. Root hairs, which are extensions of root epidermal cells, increase the\nsurface area of the root, greatly contributing to the absorption of water and minerals.\nInside the root, the ground tissue forms two regions: the cortex and the pith (Figure 30.17). Compared to stems, roots have lots\nof cortex and little pith. Both regions include cells that store photosynthetic products. The cortex is between the epidermis and\nthe vascular tissue, whereas the pith lies between the vascular tissue and the center of the root.\nFigure 30.17 Staining reveals different cell types in this light micrograph of a wheat (Triticum) root cross section. Sclerenchyma cells of the\nexodermis and xylem cells stain red, and phloem cells stain blue. Other cell types stain black. The stele, or vascular tissue, is the area\ninside endodermis (indicated by a green ring). Root hairs are visible outside the epidermis. (credit: scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root, which is called the stele (Figure 30.18). A layer of cells\nknown as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root. The endodermis is\nexclusive to roots, and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the root\u2019s vascular system. A waxy substance called suberin\nis present on the walls of the endodermal cells. This waxy region, known as the Casparian strip, forces water and solutes to cross\nthe plasma membranes of endodermal cells instead of slipping between the cells. This ensures that only materials required by\nthe root pass through the endodermis, while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded. The outermost cell layer of\nthe root\u2019s vascular tissue is the pericycle, an area that can give rise to lateral roots. In dicot roots, the xylem and phloem of the\nstele are arranged alternately in an X shape, whereas in monocot roots, the vascular tissue is arranged in a ring around the pith.\nFigure 30.18 In (left) typical dicots, the vascular tissue forms an X shape in the center of the root. In (right) typical monocots, the phloem\ncells and the larger xylem cells form a characteristic ring around the central pith.\nRoot Modifications\nRoot structures may be modified for specific purposes. For example, some roots are bulbous and store starch. Aerial roots and\n30.3 \u2022 Roots\n841\nprop roots are two forms of aboveground roots that provide additional support to anchor the plant. Tap roots, such as carrots,\nturnips, and beets, are examples of roots that are modified for food storage (Figure 30.19).\nFigure 30.19 Many vegetables are modified roots.\nEpiphytic roots enable a plant to grow on another plant. For example, the epiphytic roots of orchids develop a spongy tissue to\nabsorb moisture. The banyan tree (Ficus sp.) begins as an epiphyte, germinating in the branches of a host tree; aerial roots\ndevelop from the branches and eventually reach the ground, providing additional support (Figure 30.20). In screwpine\n(Pandanus sp.), a palm-like tree that grows in sandy tropical soils, aboveground prop roots develop from the nodes to provide\nadditional support.\nFigure 30.20 The (a) banyan tree, also known as the strangler fig, begins life as an epiphyte in a host tree. Aerial roots extend to the ground\nand support the growing plant, which eventually strangles the host tree. The (b) screwpine develops aboveground roots that help support\nthe plant in sandy soils.

Most leaves are usually green, due to\nthe presence of chlorophyll in the leaf cells. However, some leaves may have different colors, caused by other plant pigments that\nmask the green chlorophyll.\nThe thickness, shape, and size of leaves are adapted to the environment. Each variation helps a plant species maximize its\nchances of survival in a particular habitat. Usually, the leaves of plants growing in tropical rainforests have larger surface areas\nthan those of plants growing in deserts or very cold conditions, which are likely to have a smaller surface area to minimize water\nloss.\n842\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nStructure of a Typical Leaf\nEach leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina, which is also the widest part of the leaf. Some leaves are attached to the\nplant stem by a petiole. Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves.\nSmall green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules. Most leaves have a midrib, which travels\nthe length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue. The edge of the leaf is called the margin.\nFigure 30.21 shows the structure of a typical eudicot leaf.\nFigure 30.21 Deceptively simple in appearance, a leaf is a highly efficient structure.\nWithin each leaf, the vascular tissue forms veins. The arrangement of veins in a leaf is called the venation pattern. Monocots and\ndicots differ in their patterns of venation (Figure 30.22). Monocots have parallel venation; the veins run in straight lines across\nthe length of the leaf without converging at a point. In dicots, however, the veins of the leaf have a net-like appearance, forming\na pattern known as reticulate venation. One extant plant, the Ginkgo biloba, has dichotomous venation where the veins fork.\nFigure 30.22 (a) Tulip (Tulipa), a monocot, has leaves with parallel venation. The netlike venation in this (b) linden (Tilia cordata) leaf\ndistinguishes it as a dicot. The (c) Ginkgo biloba tree has dichotomous venation.

The number and placement of a plant\u2019s leaves will vary depending\non the species, with each species exhibiting a characteristic leaf arrangement. Leaves are classified as either alternate, spiral, or\nopposite. Plants that have only one leaf per node have leaves that are said to be either alternate\u2014meaning the leaves alternate on\neach side of the stem in a flat plane\u2014or spiral, meaning the leaves are arrayed in a spiral along the stem. In an opposite leaf\narrangement, two leaves arise at the same point, with the leaves connecting opposite each other along the branch. If there are\nthree or more leaves connected at a node, the leaf arrangement is classified as whorled.\nLeaf Form\nLeaves may be simple or compound (Figure 30.23). In a simple leaf, the blade is either completely undivided\u2014as in the banana\nleaf\u2014or it has lobes, but the separation does not reach the midrib, as in the maple leaf. In a compound leaf, the leaf blade is\ncompletely divided, forming leaflets, as in the locust tree. Each leaflet may have its own stalk, but is attached to the rachis. A\npalmately compound leaf resembles the palm of a hand, with leaflets radiating outwards from one point. Examples include the\nleaves of poison ivy, the buckeye tree, or the familiar houseplant Schefflera sp. (common name \u201cumbrella plant\u201d). Pinnately\ncompound leaves take their name from their feather-like appearance; the leaflets are arranged along the midrib, as in rose\nleaves (Rosa sp.), or the leaves of hickory, pecan, ash, or walnut trees.\nFigure 30.23 Leaves may be simple or compound. In simple leaves, the lamina is continuous. The (a) banana plant (Musa sp.) has simple\nleaves. In compound leaves, the lamina is separated into leaflets. Compound leaves may be palmate or pinnate. In (b) palmately compound\nleaves, such as those of the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), the leaflets branch from the petiole. In (c) pinnately compound\nleaves, the leaflets branch from the midrib, as on a scrub hickory (Carya floridana). The (d) honey locust has double compound leaves, in\nwhich leaflets branch from the veins.

Botanists call the upper side the adaxial surface (or adaxis) and the lower side the abaxial surface (or\nabaxis). The epidermis helps in the regulation of gas exchange. It contains stomata (Figure 30.24): openings through which the\n844\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nexchange of gases takes place. Two guard cells surround each stoma, regulating its opening and closing.\nFigure 30.24 Visualized at 500x with a scanning electron microscope, several stomata are clearly visible on (a) the surface of this sumac\n(Rhus glabra) leaf. At 5,000x magnification, the guard cells of (b) a single stoma from lyre-leaved sand cress (Arabidopsis lyrata) have the\nappearance of lips that surround the opening. In this (c) light micrograph cross-section of an A. lyrata leaf, the guard cell pair is visible along\nwith the large, sub-stomatal air space in the leaf. (credit: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; part c scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe epidermis is usually one cell layer thick; however, in plants that grow in very hot or very cold conditions, the epidermis may\nbe several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from transpiration. A waxy layer known as the cuticle covers the\nleaves of all plant species. The cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface. Other leaves may have small hairs\n(trichomes) on the leaf surface. Trichomes help to deter herbivory by restricting insect movements, or by storing toxic or bad-\ntasting compounds; they can also reduce the rate of transpiration by blocking air flow across the leaf surface (Figure 30.25).\nFigure 30.25 Trichomes give leaves a fuzzy appearance as in this (a) sundew (Drosera sp.). Leaf trichomes include (b) branched trichomes\non the leaf of Arabidopsis lyrata and (c) multibranched trichomes on a mature Quercus marilandica leaf. (credit a: John Freeland; credit b, c:\nmodification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nBelow the epidermis of dicot leaves are layers of cells known as the mesophyll, or \u201cmiddle leaf.\u201d The mesophyll of most leaves\ntypically contains two arrangements of parenchyma cells: the palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma (Figure 30.26). The\npalisade parenchyma (also called the palisade mesophyll) has column-shaped, tightly packed cells, and may be present in one,\ntwo, or three layers. Below the palisade parenchyma are loosely arranged cells of an irregular shape. These are the cells of the\nspongy parenchyma (or spongy mesophyll). The air space found between the spongy parenchyma cells allows gaseous exchange\nbetween the leaf and the outside atmosphere through the stomata. In aquatic plants, the intercellular spaces in the spongy\nparenchyma help the leaf float. Both layers of the mesophyll contain many chloroplasts. Guard cells are the only epidermal cells\nto contain chloroplasts.\n30.4 \u2022 Leaves\n845\nFigure 30.26 In the (a) leaf drawing, the central mesophyll is sandwiched between an upper and lower epidermis. The mesophyll has two\nlayers: an upper palisade layer comprised of tightly packed, columnar cells, and a lower spongy layer, comprised of loosely packed,\nirregularly shaped cells. Stomata on the leaf underside allow gas exchange. A waxy cuticle covers all aerial surfaces of land plants to\nminimize water loss. These leaf layers are clearly visible in the (b) scanning electron micrograph. The numerous small bumps in the\npalisade parenchyma cells are chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are also present in the spongy parenchyma, but are not as obvious. The bumps\nprotruding from the lower surface of the leave are glandular trichomes, which differ in structure from the stalked trichomes in Figure 30.25.\n(credit b: modification of work by Robert R. Wise)\nLike the stem, the leaf contains vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem (Figure 30.27). The xylem consists of tracheids\nand vessels, which transport water and minerals to the leaves. The phloem transports the photosynthetic products from the leaf\nto the other parts of the plant. A single vascular bundle, no matter how large or small, always contains both xylem and phloem\ntissues.\n846\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 30.27 This scanning electron micrograph shows xylem and phloem in the leaf vascular bundle from the lyre-leaved sand cress\n(Arabidopsis lyrata). (credit: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nLeaf Adaptations\nConiferous plant species that thrive in cold environments, like spruce, fir, and pine, have leaves that are reduced in size and\nneedle-like in appearance. These needle-like leaves have sunken stomata and a smaller surface area: two attributes that aid in\nreducing water loss. In hot climates, plants such as cacti have leaves that are reduced to spines, which in combination with their\nsucculent stems, help to conserve water. Many aquatic plants have leaves with wide lamina that can float on the surface of the\nwater, and a thick waxy cuticle on the leaf surface that repels water.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch \u201cThe Pale Pitcher Plant\u201d episode of the video (http://openstax.org/l/plants_cool_too) series Plants Are Cool, Too, a\nBotanical Society of America video about a carnivorous plant species found in Louisiana.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nPlant Adaptations in Resource-Deficient Environments\nRoots, stems, and leaves are structured to ensure that a plant can obtain the required sunlight, water, soil nutrients, and oxygen\nresources. Some remarkable adaptations have evolved to enable plant species to thrive in less than ideal habitats, where one or\nmore of these resources is in short supply.\nIn tropical rainforests, light is often scarce, since many trees and plants grow close together and block much of the sunlight from\nreaching the forest floor. Many tropical plant species have exceptionally broad leaves to maximize the capture of sunlight. Other\nspecies are epiphytes: plants that grow on other plants that serve as a physical support. Such plants are able to grow high up in\nthe canopy atop the branches of other trees, where sunlight is more plentiful. Epiphytes live on rain and minerals collected in\nthe branches and leaves of the supporting plant. Bromeliads (members of the pineapple family), ferns, and orchids are examples\nof tropical epiphytes (Figure 30.28). Many epiphytes have specialized tissues that enable them to efficiently capture and store\nwater.\n30.4 \u2022 Leaves\n847\nFigure 30.28 One of the most well known bromeliads is Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), seen here in an oak tree. (credit: Kristine\nPaulus)\nSome plants have special adaptations that help them to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Carnivorous plants, such as the\nVenus flytrap and the pitcher plant (Figure 30.29), grow in bogs where the soil is low in nitrogen. In these plants, leaves are\nmodified to capture insects. The insect-capturing leaves may have evolved to provide these plants with a supplementary source\nof much-needed nitrogen.\nFigure 30.29 The (a) Venus flytrap has modified leaves that can capture insects. When an unlucky insect touches the trigger hairs inside the\nleaf, the trap suddenly closes. The opening of the (b) pitcher plant is lined with a slippery wax. Insects crawling on the lip slip and fall into a\npool of water in the bottom of the pitcher, where they are digested by bacteria. The plant then absorbs the smaller molecules. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Peter Shanks; credit b: modification of work by Tim Mansfield)\nMany swamp plants have adaptations that enable them to thrive in wet areas, where their roots grow submerged underwater. In\nthese aquatic areas, the soil is unstable and little oxygen is available to reach the roots. Trees such as mangroves (Rhizophora sp.)\ngrowing in coastal waters produce aboveground roots that help support the tree (Figure 30.30). Some species of mangroves, as\nwell as cypress trees, have pneumatophores: upward-growing roots containing pores and pockets of tissue specialized for gas\nexchange. Wild rice is an aquatic plant with large air spaces in the root cortex. The air-filled tissue\u2014called\naerenchyma\u2014provides a path for oxygen to diffuse down to the root tips, which are embedded in oxygen-poor bottom\nsediments.\n848\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 30.30 The branches of (a) mangrove trees develop aerial roots, which descend to the ground and help to anchor the trees.

The phloem and xylem are the main tissues responsible for this movement. Water potential, evapotranspiration, and\nstomatal regulation influence how water and nutrients are transported in plants. To understand how these processes work, we\nmust first understand the energetics of water potential.\nWater Potential\nPlants are phenomenal hydraulic engineers. Using only the basic laws of physics and the simple manipulation of potential\nenergy, plants can move water to the top of a 116-meter-tall tree (Figure 30.31a). Plants can also use hydraulics to generate\nenough force to split rocks and buckle sidewalks (Figure 30.31b). Plants achieve this because of water potential.\n30.5 \u2022 Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants\n849\nFigure 30.31 With heights nearing 116 meters, (a) coastal redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) are the tallest trees in the world. Plant roots\ncan easily generate enough force to (b) buckle and break concrete sidewalks, much to the dismay of homeowners and city maintenance\ndepartments. (credit a: modification of work by Bernt Rostad; credit b: modification of work by Pedestrians Educating Drivers on Safety,\nInc.)\nWater potential is a measure of the potential energy in water. Plant physiologists are not interested in the energy in any one\nparticular aqueous system, but are very interested in water movement between two systems. In practical terms, therefore, water\npotential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and pure water (at atmospheric pressure and\nambient temperature). Water potential is denoted by the Greek letter \u03c8 (psi) and is expressed in units of pressure (pressure is a\nform of energy) called megapascals (MPa). The potential of pure water (\u03a8wpure H2O) is, by convenience of definition, designated a\nvalue of zero (even though pure water contains plenty of potential energy, that energy is ignored). Water potential values for the\nwater in a plant root, stem, or leaf are therefore expressed relative to \u03a8wpure H2O.\nThe water potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and factors called matrix effects.\nWater potential can be broken down into its individual components using the following equation:\nwhere \u03a8s, \u03a8p, \u03a8g, and \u03a8m refer to the solute, pressure, gravity, and matric potentials, respectively. \u201cSystem\u201d can refer to the\nwater potential of the soil water (\u03a8soil), root water (\u03a8root), stem water (\u03a8stem), leaf water (\u03a8leaf) or the water in the atmosphere\n(\u03a8atmosphere): whichever aqueous system is under consideration. As the individual components change, they raise or lower the\ntotal water potential of a system. When this happens, water moves to equilibrate, moving from the system or compartment with\na higher water potential to the system or compartment with a lower water potential. This brings the difference in water potential\nbetween the two systems (\u0394\u03a8) back to zero (\u0394\u03a8 = 0). Therefore, for water to move through the plant from the soil to the air (a\nprocess called transpiration), \u03a8soil must be > \u03a8root > \u03a8stem > \u03a8leaf > \u03a8atmosphere.\nWater only moves in response to \u0394\u03a8, not in response to the individual components. However, because the individual\ncomponents influence the total \u03a8system, by manipulating the individual components (especially \u03a8s), a plant can control water\nmovement.\nSolute Potential\nSolute potential (\u03a8s), also called osmotic potential, is related to the solute concentration (in molarity). That relationship is given\nby the van 't Hoff equation: \u03a8s= \u2013Mi RT; where M is the molar concentration of the solute, i is the van 't Hoff factor (the ratio of\nthe amount of particles in the solution to amount of formula units dissolved), R is the ideal gas constant, and T is temperature in\nKelvin degrees. The solute potential is negative in a plant cell and zero in distilled water. Typical values for cell cytoplasm are\n\u20130.5 to \u20131.0 MPa. Solutes reduce water potential (resulting in a negative \u03a8w) by consuming some of the potential energy\navailable in the water. Solute molecules can dissolve in water because water molecules can bind to them via hydrogen bonds; a\nhydrophobic molecule like oil, which cannot bind to water, cannot go into solution. The energy in the hydrogen bonds between\nsolute molecules and water is no longer available to do work in the system because it is tied up in the bond. In other words, the\namount of available potential energy is reduced when solutes are added to an aqueous system. Thus, \u03a8 s decreases with\nincreasing solute concentration. Because \u03a8s is one of the four components of \u03a8system or \u03a8total, a decrease in \u03a8s will cause a\n850\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ndecrease in \u03a8total. The internal water potential of a plant cell is more negative than pure water because of the cytoplasm\u2019s high\nsolute content (Figure 30.32). Because of this difference in water potential water will move from the soil into a plant\u2019s root cells\nvia the process of osmosis. This is why solute potential is sometimes called osmotic potential.\nPlant cells can metabolically manipulate \u03a8s (and by extension, \u03a8total) by adding or removing solute molecules. Therefore, plants\nhave control over \u03a8total via their ability to exert metabolic control over \u03a8s.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 30.32 In this example with a semipermeable membrane between two aqueous systems, water will move from a region of higher to\nlower water potential until equilibrium is reached. Solutes (\u03a8s), pressure (\u03a8p), and gravity (\u03a8g) influence total water potential for each side\nof the tube (\u03a8total right or left), and therefore, the difference between \u03a8total on each side (\u0394\u03a8). (\u03a8m , the potential due to interaction of water\nwith solid substrates, is ignored in this example because glass is not especially hydrophilic). Water moves in response to the difference in\nwater potential between two systems (the left and right sides of the tube).\nPositive water potential is placed on the left side of the tube by increasing \u03a8p such that the water level rises on the right side.\nCould you equalize the water level on each side of the tube by adding solute, and if so, how?\nPressure Potential\nPressure potential (\u03a8p), also called turgor potential, may be positive or negative (Figure 30.32). Because pressure is an\nexpression of energy, the higher the pressure, the more potential energy in a system, and vice versa. Therefore, a positive \u03a8p\n(compression) increases \u03a8total, and a negative \u03a8p (tension) decreases \u03a8total. Positive pressure inside cells is contained by the cell\nwall, producing turgor pressure. Pressure potentials are typically around 0.6\u20130.8 MPa, but can reach as high as 1.5 MPa in a\nwell-watered plant. A \u03a8p of 1.5 MPa equates to 210 pounds per square inch (1.5 MPa x 140 lb/in-2 MPa-1 = 210 lb/in-2). As a\ncomparison, most automobile tires are kept at a pressure of 30\u201334 psi. An example of the effect of turgor pressure is the wilting\nof leaves and their restoration after the plant has been watered (Figure 30.33). Water is lost from the leaves via transpiration\n(approaching \u03a8p = 0 MPa at the wilting point) and restored by uptake via the roots.\nA plant can manipulate \u03a8p via its ability to manipulate \u03a8s and by the process of osmosis. If a plant cell increases the cytoplasmic\n30.5 \u2022 Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants\n851\nsolute concentration, \u03a8s will decline, \u03a8total will decline, the \u0394\u03a8 between the cell and the surrounding tissue will decline, water\nwill move into the cell by osmosis, and \u03a8p will increase. \u03a8p is also under indirect plant control via the opening and closing of\nstomata. Stomatal openings allow water to evaporate from the leaf, reducing \u03a8p and \u03a8total of the leaf and increasing \u03a8 between\nthe water in the leaf and the petiole, thereby allowing water to flow from the petiole into the leaf.\nFigure 30.33 When (a) total water potential (\u03a8total) is lower outside the cells than inside, water moves out of the cells and the plant wilts.\nWhen (b) the total water potential is higher outside the plant cells than inside, water moves into the cells, resulting in turgor pressure (\u03a8p)\nand keeping the plant erect. (credit: modification of work by Victor M. Vicente Selvas)\nGravity Potential\nGravity potential (\u03a8g) is always negative to zero in a plant with no height. It always removes or consumes potential energy from\nthe system. The force of gravity pulls water downwards to the soil, reducing the total amount of potential energy in the water in\nthe plant (\u03a8total). The taller the plant, the taller the water column, and the more influential \u03a8g becomes. On a cellular scale and\nin short plants, this effect is negligible and easily ignored. However, over the height of a tall tree like a giant coastal redwood, the\ngravitational pull of \u20130.1 MPa m-1 is equivalent to an extra 1 MPa of resistance that must be overcome for water to reach the\nleaves of the tallest trees. Plants are unable to manipulate \u03a8g.\nMatric Potential\nMatric potential (\u03a8m) is always negative to zero. In a dry system, it can be as low as \u20132 MPa in a dry seed, and it is zero in a\nwater-saturated system. The binding of water to a matrix always removes or consumes potential energy from the system. \u03a8m is\nsimilar to solute potential because it involves tying up the energy in an aqueous system by forming hydrogen bonds between the\nwater and some other component. However, in solute potential, the other components are soluble, hydrophilic solute molecules,\nwhereas in \u03a8m, the other components are insoluble, hydrophilic molecules of the plant cell wall. Every plant cell has a cellulosic\ncell wall and the cellulose in the cell walls is hydrophilic, producing a matrix for adhesion of water: hence the name matric\npotential. \u03a8m is very large (negative) in dry tissues such as seeds or drought-affected soils. However, it quickly goes to zero as\nthe seed takes up water or the soil hydrates. \u03a8m cannot be manipulated by the plant and is typically ignored in well-watered\nroots, stems, and leaves.\nMovement of Water and Minerals in the Xylem\nSolutes, pressure, gravity, and matric potential are all important for the transport of water in plants. Water moves from an area\nof higher total water potential (higher Gibbs free energy) to an area of lower total water potential. Gibbs free energy is the energy\nassociated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work. This is expressed as \u0394\u03a8.\nTranspiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface. It is the main driver of water\nmovement in the xylem. Transpiration is caused by the evaporation of water at the leaf\u2013atmosphere interface; it creates\nnegative pressure (tension) equivalent to \u20132 MPa at the leaf surface. This value varies greatly depending on the vapor pressure\ndeficit, which can be negligible at high relative humidity (RH) and substantial at low RH. Water from the roots is pulled up by\nthis tension. At night, when stomata shut and transpiration stops, the water is held in the stem and leaf by the adhesion of\nwater to the cell walls of the xylem vessels and tracheids, and the cohesion of water molecules to each other. This is called the\ncohesion\u2013tension theory of sap ascent.\nInside the leaf at the cellular level, water on the surface of mesophyll cells saturates the cellulose microfibrils of the primary cell\nwall. The leaf contains many large intercellular air spaces for the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide, which is required for\n852\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nphotosynthesis. The wet cell wall is exposed to this leaf internal air space, and the water on the surface of the cells evaporates\ninto the air spaces, decreasing the thin film on the surface of the mesophyll cells. This decrease creates a greater tension on the\nwater in the mesophyll cells (Figure 30.34), thereby increasing the pull on the water in the xylem vessels. The xylem vessels and\ntracheids are structurally adapted to cope with large changes in pressure. Rings in the vessels maintain their tubular shape,\nmuch like the rings on a vacuum cleaner hose keep the hose open while it is under pressure. Small perforations between vessel\nelements reduce the number and size of gas bubbles that can form via a process called cavitation. The formation of gas bubbles\nin xylem interrupts the continuous stream of water from the base to the top of the plant, causing a break termed an embolism in\nthe flow of xylem sap. The taller the tree, the greater the tension forces needed to pull water, and the more cavitation events. In\nlarger trees, the resulting embolisms can plug xylem vessels, making them nonfunctional.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 30.34 The cohesion\u2013tension theory of sap ascent is shown. Evaporation from the mesophyll cells produces a negative water\npotential gradient that causes water to move upwards from the roots through the xylem.\nWhich of the following statements is false?\na.\nNegative water potential draws water into the root hairs. Cohesion and adhesion draw water up the xylem. Transpiration\ndraws water from the leaf.\nb.\nNegative water potential draws water into the root hairs. Cohesion and adhesion draw water up the phloem. Transpiration\ndraws water from the leaf.\nc.\nWater potential decreases from the roots to the top of the plant.\nd.\nWater enters the plants through root hairs and exits through stoma.\nTranspiration\u2014the loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomata\u2014is a passive process, meaning that metabolic\nenergy in the form of ATP is not required for water movement. The energy driving transpiration is the difference in energy\nbetween the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere. However, transpiration is tightly controlled.\n30.5 \u2022 Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants\n853\nControl of Transpiration\nThe atmosphere to which the leaf is exposed drives transpiration, but also causes massive water loss from the plant. Up to 90\npercent of the water taken up by roots may be lost through transpiration.\nLeaves are covered by a waxy cuticle on the outer surface that prevents the loss of water. Regulation of transpiration, therefore,\nis achieved primarily through the opening and closing of stomata on the leaf surface. Stomata are surrounded by two\nspecialized cells called guard cells, which open and close in response to environmental cues such as light intensity and quality,\nleaf water status, and carbon dioxide concentrations. Stomata must open to allow air containing carbon dioxide and oxygen to\ndiffuse into the leaf for photosynthesis and respiration. When stomata are open, however, water vapor is lost to the external\nenvironment, increasing the rate of transpiration. Therefore, plants must maintain a balance between efficient photosynthesis\nand water loss.\nPlants have evolved over time to adapt to their local environment and reduce transpiration (Figure 30.35). Desert plant\n(xerophytes) and plants that grow on other plants (epiphytes) have limited access to water. Such plants usually have a much\nthicker waxy cuticle than those growing in more moderate, well-watered environments (mesophytes). Aquatic plants\n(hydrophytes) also have their own set of anatomical and morphological leaf adaptations.\nFigure 30.35 Plants are suited to their local environment. (a) Xerophytes, like this prickly pear cactus (Opuntia sp.) and (b) epiphytes such\nas this tropical Aeschynanthus perrottetii have adapted to very limited water resources. The leaves of a prickly pear are modified into\nspines, which lowers the surface-to-volume ratio and reduces water loss. Photosynthesis takes place in the stem, which also stores water.\n(b) A. perottetii leaves have a waxy cuticle that prevents water loss. (c) Goldenrod (Solidago sp.) is a mesophyte, well suited for moderate\nenvironments. (d) Hydrophytes, like this fragrant water lily (Nymphaea odorata), are adapted to thrive in aquatic environments.

Shyamal/Wikimedia Commons; credit c: modification of work by\n854\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nHuw Williams; credit d: modification of work by Jason Hollinger)\nXerophytes and epiphytes often have a thick covering of trichomes or of stomata that are sunken below the leaf\u2019s surface.\nTrichomes are specialized hair-like epidermal cells that secrete oils and substances. These adaptations impede air flow across\nthe stomatal pore and reduce transpiration. Multiple epidermal layers are also commonly found in these types of plants.\nTransportation of Photosynthates in the Phloem\nPlants need an energy source to grow. In seeds and bulbs, food is stored in polymers (such as starch) that are converted by\nmetabolic processes into sucrose for newly developing plants. Once green shoots and leaves are growing, plants are able to\nproduce their own food by photosynthesizing. The products of photosynthesis are called photosynthates, which are usually in\nthe form of simple sugars such as sucrose.\nStructures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources. Sugars produced in sources, such as\nleaves, need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation. The points of sugar\ndelivery, such as roots, young shoots, and developing seeds, are called sinks. Seeds, tubers, and bulbs can be either a source or a\nsink, depending on the plant\u2019s stage of development and the season.\nThe products from the source are usually translocated to the nearest sink through the phloem. For example, the highest leaves\nwill send photosynthates upward to the growing shoot tip, whereas lower leaves will direct photosynthates downward to the\nroots. Intermediate leaves will send products in both directions, unlike the flow in the xylem, which is always unidirectional (soil\nto leaf to atmosphere). The pattern of photosynthate flow changes as the plant grows and develops. Photosynthates are directed\nprimarily to the roots early on, to shoots and leaves during vegetative growth, and to seeds and fruits during reproductive\ndevelopment. They are also directed to tubers for storage.\nTranslocation: Transport from Source to Sink\nPhotosynthates, such as sucrose, are produced in the mesophyll cells of photosynthesizing leaves. From there they are\ntranslocated through the phloem to where they are used or stored. Mesophyll cells are connected by cytoplasmic channels called\nplasmodesmata. Photosynthates move through these channels to reach phloem sieve-tube elements (STEs) in the vascular\nbundles. From the mesophyll cells, the photosynthates are loaded into the phloem STEs. The sucrose is actively transported\nagainst its concentration gradient (a process requiring ATP) into the phloem cells using the electrochemical potential of the\nproton gradient. This is coupled to the uptake of sucrose with a carrier protein called the sucrose-H+ symporter.\nPhloem STEs have reduced cytoplasmic contents, and are connected by a sieve plate with pores that allow for pressure-driven\nbulk flow, or translocation, of phloem sap. Companion cells are associated with STEs. They assist with metabolic activities and\nproduce energy for the STEs (Figure 30.36).\nFigure 30.36 Phloem is comprised of cells called sieve-tube elements. Phloem sap travels through perforations called sieve tube plates.\n30.5 \u2022 Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants\n855\nNeighboring companion cells carry out metabolic functions for the sieve-tube elements and provide them with energy. Lateral sieve areas\nconnect the sieve-tube elements to the companion cells.\nOnce in the phloem, the photosynthates are translocated to the closest sink. Phloem sap is an aqueous solution that contains up\nto 30 percent sugar, minerals, amino acids, and plant growth regulators. The high percentage of sugar decreases \u03a8s, which\ndecreases the total water potential and causes water to move by osmosis from the adjacent xylem into the phloem tubes, thereby\nincreasing pressure. This increase in total water potential causes the bulk flow of phloem from source to sink (Figure 30.37).\nSucrose concentration in the sink cells is lower than in the phloem STEs because the sink sucrose has been metabolized for\ngrowth, or converted to starch for storage or other polymers, such as cellulose, for structural integrity. Unloading at the sink end\nof the phloem tube occurs by either diffusion or active transport of sucrose molecules from an area of high concentration to one\nof low concentration. Water diffuses from the phloem by osmosis and is then transpired or recycled via the xylem back into the\nphloem sap.\nFigure 30.37 Sucrose is actively transported from source cells into companion cells and then into the sieve-tube elements. This reduces\nthe water potential, which causes water to enter the phloem from the xylem. The resulting positive pressure forces the sucrose-water\nmixture down toward the roots, where sucrose is unloaded. Transpiration causes water to return to the leaves through the xylem vessels.\n30.6 Plant Sensory Systems and Responses\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe how red and blue light affect plant growth and metabolic activities\n\u2022\nDiscuss gravitropism\n\u2022\nUnderstand how hormones affect plant growth and development\n\u2022\nDescribe thigmotropism, thigmonastism, and thigmogenesis\n\u2022\nExplain how plants defend themselves from predators and respond to wounds\nAnimals can respond to environmental factors by moving to a new location. Plants, however, are rooted in place and must\nrespond to the surrounding environmental factors. Plants have sophisticated systems to detect and respond to light, gravity,\ntemperature, and physical touch. Receptors sense environmental factors and relay the information to effector systems\u2014often\nthrough intermediate chemical messengers\u2014to bring about plant responses.\nPlant Responses to Light\nPlants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to photosynthesize low-molecular-weight\nsugars using only carbon dioxide, light, and water. Photomorphogenesis is the growth and development of plants in response\nto light. It allows plants to optimize their use of light and space. Photoperiodism is the ability to use light to track time. Plants\n856\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncan tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight. Phototropism is a directional\nresponse that allows plants to grow towards, or even away from, light.\nThe sensing of light in the environment is important to plants; it can be crucial for competition and survival. The response of\nplants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors, which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a light-absorbing\npigment called a chromophore. Together, the two are called a chromoprotein.\nThe red/far-red and violet-blue regions of the visible light spectrum trigger structural development in plants. Sensory\nphotoreceptors absorb light in these particular regions of the visible light spectrum because of the quality of light available in\nthe daylight spectrum. In terrestrial habitats, light absorption by chlorophylls peaks in the blue and red regions of the spectrum.\nAs light filters through the canopy and the blue and red wavelengths are absorbed, the spectrum shifts to the far-red end,\nshifting the plant community to those plants better adapted to respond to far-red light. Blue-light receptors allow plants to\ngauge the direction and abundance of sunlight, which is rich in blue\u2013green emissions. Water absorbs red light, which makes\nthe detection of blue light essential for algae and aquatic plants.\nThe Phytochrome System and the Red/Far-Red Response\nThe phytochromes are a family of chromoproteins with a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore, similar to the ringed tetrapyrrole\nlight-absorbing head group of chlorophyll. Phytochromes have two photo-interconvertible forms: Pr and Pfr. Pr absorbs red\nlight (~667 nm) and is immediately converted to Pfr. Pfr absorbs far-red light (~730 nm) and is quickly converted back to Pr.\nAbsorption of red or far-red light causes a massive change to the shape of the chromophore, altering the conformation and\nactivity of the phytochrome protein to which it is bound. Pfr is the physiologically active form of the protein; therefore, exposure\nto red light yields physiological activity. Exposure to far-red light inhibits phytochrome activity. Together, the two forms\nrepresent the phytochrome system (Figure 30.38).\nThe phytochrome system acts as a biological light switch. It monitors the level, intensity, duration, and color of environmental\nlight. The effect of red light is reversible by immediately shining far-red light on the sample, which converts the chromoprotein\nto the inactive Pr form. Additionally, Pfr can slowly revert to Pr in the dark, or break down over time. In all instances, the\nphysiological response induced by red light is reversed. The active form of phytochrome (Pfr) can directly activate other\nmolecules in the cytoplasm, or it can be trafficked to the nucleus, where it directly activates or represses specific gene\nexpression.\nOnce the phytochrome system evolved, plants adapted it to serve a variety of needs. Unfiltered, full sunlight contains much\nmore red light than far-red light. Because chlorophyll absorbs strongly in the red region of the visible spectrum, but not in the\nfar-red region, any plant in the shade of another plant on the forest floor will be exposed to red-depleted, far-red-enriched light.\nThe preponderance of far-red light converts phytochrome in the shaded leaves to the Pr (inactive) form, slowing growth. The\nnearest non-shaded (or even less-shaded) areas on the forest floor have more red light; leaves exposed to these areas sense the\nred light, which activates the Pfr form and induces growth. In short, plant shoots use the phytochrome system to grow away\nfrom shade and towards light. Because competition for light is so fierce in a dense plant community, the evolutionary\nadvantages of the phytochrome system are obvious.\nIn seeds, the phytochrome system is not used to determine direction and quality of light (shaded versus unshaded). Instead, is it\nused merely to determine if there is any light at all. This is especially important in species with very small seeds, such as lettuce.\nBecause of their size, lettuce seeds have few food reserves. Their seedlings cannot grow for long before they run out of fuel. If\nthey germinated even a centimeter under the soil surface, the seedling would never make it into the sunlight and would die. In\nthe dark, phytochrome is in the Pr (inactive form) and the seed will not germinate; it will only germinate if exposed to light at\nthe surface of the soil. Upon exposure to light, Pr is converted to Pfr and germination proceeds.\n30.6 \u2022 Plant Sensory Systems and Responses\n857\nFigure 30.38 The biologically inactive form of phytochrome (Pr) is converted to the biologically active form Pfr under illumination with red\nlight. Far-red light and darkness convert the molecule back to the inactive form.\nPlants also use the phytochrome system to sense the change of season. Photoperiodism is a biological response to the timing\nand duration of day and night. It controls flowering, setting of winter buds, and vegetative growth. Detection of seasonal\nchanges is crucial to plant survival. Although temperature and light intensity influence plant growth, they are not reliable\nindicators of season because they may vary from one year to the next. Day length is a better indicator of the time of year.\nAs stated above, unfiltered sunlight is rich in red light but deficient in far-red light. Therefore, at dawn, all the phytochrome\nmolecules in a leaf quickly convert to the active Pfr form, and remain in that form until sunset. In the dark, the Pfr form takes\nhours to slowly revert back to the Pr form. If the night is long (as in winter), all of the Pfr form reverts. If the night is short (as in\nsummer), a considerable amount of Pfr may remain at sunrise. By sensing the Pr/Pfr ratio at dawn, a plant can determine the\nlength of the day/night cycle. In addition, leaves retain that information for several days, allowing a comparison between the\nlength of the previous night and the preceding several nights. Shorter nights indicate springtime to the plant; when the nights\nbecome longer, autumn is approaching. This information, along with sensing temperature and water availability, allows plants\nto determine the time of the year and adjust their physiology accordingly. Short-day (long-night) plants use this information to\nflower in the late summer and early fall, when nights exceed a critical length (often eight or fewer hours). Long-day (short-night)\nplants flower during the spring, when darkness is less than a critical length (often eight to 15 hours). Not all plants use the\nphytochrome system in this way. Flowering in day-neutral plants is not regulated by daylength.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nHorticulturalist\nThe word \u201chorticulturist\u201d comes from the Latin words for garden (hortus) and culture (cultura). This career has been\nrevolutionized by progress made in the understanding of plant responses to environmental stimuli. Growers of crops, fruit,\nvegetables, and flowers were previously constrained by having to time their sowing and harvesting according to the season.\nNow, horticulturists can manipulate plants to increase leaf, flower, or fruit production by understanding how environmental\nfactors affect plant growth and development.\nGreenhouse management is an essential component of a horticulturist\u2019s education. To lengthen the night, plants are covered\nwith a blackout shade cloth. Long-day plants are irradiated with red light in winter to promote early flowering. For example,\nfluorescent (cool white) light high in blue wavelengths encourages leafy growth and is excellent for starting seedlings.\nIncandescent lamps (standard light bulbs) are rich in red light, and promote flowering in some plants. The timing of fruit\nripening can be increased or delayed by applying plant hormones. Recently, considerable progress has been made in the\ndevelopment of plant breeds that are suited to different climates and resistant to pests and transportation damage. Both crop\nyield and quality have increased as a result of practical applications of the knowledge of plant responses to external stimuli and\nhormones.\nHorticulturists find employment in private and governmental laboratories, greenhouses, botanical gardens, and in the\nproduction or research fields. They improve crops by applying their knowledge of genetics and plant physiology. To prepare for a\nhorticulture career, students take classes in botany, plant physiology, plant pathology, landscape design, and plant breeding. To\n858\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncomplement these traditional courses, horticulture majors add studies in economics, business, computer science, and\ncommunications.\nThe Blue Light Responses\nPhototropism\u2014the directional bending of a plant toward or away from a light source\u2014is a response to blue wavelengths of\nlight. Positive phototropism is growth towards a light source (Figure 30.39), while negative phototropism (also called\nskototropism) is growth away from light.\nThe aptly-named phototropins are protein-based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response. Like all plant\nphotoreceptors, phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light-absorbing portion, called the chromophore. In\nphototropins, the chromophore is a covalently-bound molecule of flavin; hence, phototropins belong to a class of proteins called\nflavoproteins.\nOther responses under the control of phototropins are leaf opening and closing, chloroplast movement, and the opening of\nstomata. However, of all responses controlled by phototropins, phototropism has been studied the longest and is the best\nunderstood.\nIn their 1880 treatise The Power of Movements in Plants, Charles Darwin and his son Francis first described phototropism as the\nbending of seedlings toward light. Darwin observed that light was perceived by the tip of the plant (the apical meristem), but\nthat the response (bending) took place in a different part of the plant. They concluded that the signal had to travel from the\napical meristem to the base of the plant.\nFigure 30.39 Azure bluets (Houstonia caerulea) display a phototropic response by bending toward the light. (credit: Cory Zanker)\nIn 1913, Peter Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that a chemical signal produced in the plant tip was responsible for the bending at\nthe base. He cut off the tip of a seedling, covered the cut section with a layer of gelatin, and then replaced the tip. The seedling\nbent toward the light when illuminated. However, when impermeable mica flakes were inserted between the tip and the cut\nbase, the seedling did not bend. A refinement of the experiment showed that the signal traveled on the shaded side of the\nseedling. When the mica plate was inserted on the illuminated side, the plant did bend towards the light. Therefore, the\nchemical signal was a growth stimulant because the phototropic response involved faster cell elongation on the shaded side than\non the illuminated side. We now know that as light passes through a plant stem, it is diffracted and generates phototropin\nactivation across the stem. Most activation occurs on the lit side, causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid (IAA) to\naccumulate on the shaded side. Stem cells elongate under influence of IAA.\nCryptochromes are another class of blue-light absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavin-based chromophore.\nCryptochromes set the plants' 24-hour activity cycle, also know as its circadian rhythem, using blue light cues. There is some\nevidence that cryptochromes work together with phototropins to mediate the phototropic response.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse the navigation menu in the left panel of this website (http://openstax.org/l/plnts_n_motion) to view images of plants in\n30.6 \u2022 Plant Sensory Systems and Responses\n859\nmotion.\nPlant Responses to Gravity\nWhether or not they germinate in the light or in total darkness, shoots usually sprout up from the ground, and roots grow\ndownward into the ground. A plant laid on its side in the dark will send shoots upward when given enough time. Gravitropism\nensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight. Growth of the shoot apical tip upward is called\nnegative gravitropism, whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism.\nAmyloplasts (also known as statoliths) are specialized plastids that contain starch granules and settle downward in response to\ngravity. Amyloplasts are found in shoots and in specialized cells of the root cap. When a plant is tilted, the statoliths drop to the\nnew bottom cell wall. A few hours later, the shoot or root will show growth in the new vertical direction.\nThe mechanism that mediates gravitropism is reasonably well understood. When amyloplasts settle to the bottom of the gravity-\nsensing cells in the root or shoot, they physically contact the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing the release of calcium ions\nfrom inside the ER. This calcium signaling in the cells causes polar transport of the plant hormone IAA to the bottom of the cell.\nIn roots, a high concentration of IAA inhibits cell elongation. The effect slows growth on the lower side of the root, while cells\ndevelop normally on the upper side. IAA has the opposite effect in shoots, where a higher concentration at the lower side of the\nshoot stimulates cell expansion, causing the shoot to grow up. After the shoot or root begin to grow vertically, the amyloplasts\nreturn to their normal position. Other hypotheses\u2014involving the entire cell in the gravitropism effect\u2014have been proposed to\nexplain why some mutants that lack amyloplasts may still exhibit a weak gravitropic response.\nGrowth Responses\nA plant\u2019s sensory response to external stimuli relies on chemical messengers (hormones). Plant hormones affect all aspects of\nplant life, from flowering to fruit setting and maturation, and from phototropism to leaf fall. Potentially every cell in a plant can\nproduce plant hormones. They can act in their cell of origin or be transported to other portions of the plant body, with many\nplant responses involving the synergistic or antagonistic interaction of two or more hormones. In contrast, animal hormones\nare produced in specific glands and transported to a distant site for action, and they act alone.\nPlant hormones are a group of unrelated chemical substances that affect plant morphogenesis. Five major plant hormones are\ntraditionally described: auxins (particularly IAA), cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene, and abscisic acid. In addition, other\nnutrients and environmental conditions can be characterized as growth factors.\nAuxins\nThe term auxin is derived from the Greek word auxein, which means \"to grow.\" Auxins are the main hormones responsible for\ncell elongation in phototropism and gravitropism. They also control the differentiation of meristem into vascular tissue, and\npromote leaf development and arrangement. While many synthetic auxins are used as herbicides, IAA is the only naturally\noccurring auxin that shows physiological activity. Apical dominance\u2014the inhibition of lateral bud formation\u2014is triggered by\nauxins produced in the apical meristem. Flowering, fruit setting and ripening, and inhibition of abscission (leaf falling) are\nother plant responses under the direct or indirect control of auxins. Auxins also act as a relay for the effects of the blue light and\nred/far-red responses.\nCommercial use of auxins is widespread in plant nurseries and for crop production. IAA is used as a rooting hormone to\npromote growth of adventitious roots on cuttings and detached leaves. Applying synthetic auxins to tomato plants in\ngreenhouses promotes normal fruit development. Outdoor application of auxin promotes synchronization of fruit setting and\ndropping to coordinate the harvesting season. Fruits such as seedless cucumbers can be induced to set fruit by treating\nunfertilized plant flowers with auxins.\nCytokinins\nThe effect of cytokinins was first reported when it was found that adding the liquid endosperm of coconuts to developing plant\nembryos in culture stimulated their growth. The stimulating growth factor was found to be cytokinin, a hormone that promotes\ncytokinesis (cell division). Almost 200 naturally occurring or synthetic cytokinins are known to date. Cytokinins are most\nabundant in growing tissues, such as roots, embryos, and fruits, where cell division is occurring. Cytokinins are known to delay\nsenescence in leaf tissues, promote mitosis, and stimulate differentiation of the meristem in shoots and roots. Many effects on\nplant development are under the influence of cytokinins, either in conjunction with auxin or another hormone. For example,\napical dominance seems to result from a balance between auxins that inhibit lateral buds, and cytokinins that promote bushier\n860\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ngrowth.\nGibberellins\nGibberellins (GAs) are a group of about 125 closely related plant hormones that stimulate shoot elongation, seed germination,\nand fruit and flower maturation. GAs are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems, young leaves, and seed embryos. In\nurban areas, GA antagonists are sometimes applied to trees under power lines to control growth and reduce the frequency of\npruning.\nGAs break dormancy (a state of inhibited growth and development) in the seeds of plants that require exposure to cold or light to\ngerminate. Abscisic acid is a strong antagonist of GA action. Other effects of GAs include gender expression, seedless fruit\ndevelopment, and the delay of senescence in leaves and fruit. Seedless grapes are obtained through standard breeding methods\nand contain inconspicuous seeds that fail to develop. Because GAs are produced by the seeds, and because fruit development\nand stem elongation are under GA control, these varieties of grapes would normally produce small fruit in compact clusters.\nMaturing grapes are routinely treated with GA to promote larger fruit size, as well as looser bunches (longer stems), which\nreduces the instance of mildew infection (Figure 30.40).\nFigure 30.40 In grapes, application of gibberellic acid increases the size of fruit and loosens clustering. (credit: Bob Nichols, USDA)\nAbscisic Acid\nThe plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton bolls.\nHowever, more recent studies indicate that ABA plays only a minor role in the abscission process. ABA accumulates as a\nresponse to stressful environmental conditions, such as dehydration, cold temperatures, or shortened day lengths. Its activity\ncounters many of the growth-promoting effects of GAs and auxins. ABA inhibits stem elongation and induces dormancy in\nlateral buds.\nABA induces dormancy in seeds by blocking germination and promoting the synthesis of storage proteins. Plants adapted to\ntemperate climates require a long period of cold temperature before seeds germinate. This mechanism protects young plants\nfrom sprouting too early during unseasonably warm weather in winter. As the hormone gradually breaks down over winter, the\nseed is released from dormancy and germinates when conditions are favorable in spring. Another effect of ABA is to promote\nthe development of winter buds; it mediates the conversion of the apical meristem into a dormant bud. Low soil moisture\ncauses an increase in ABA, which causes stomata to close, reducing water loss in winter buds.\n30.6 \u2022 Plant Sensory Systems and Responses\n861\nEthylene\nEthylene is associated with fruit ripening, flower wilting, and leaf fall. Ethylene is unusual because it is a volatile gas (C2H4).\nHundreds of years ago, when gas street lamps were installed in city streets, trees that grew close to lamp posts developed\ntwisted, thickened trunks and shed their leaves earlier than expected. These effects were caused by ethylene volatilizing from the\nlamps.\nAging tissues (especially senescing leaves) and nodes of stems produce ethylene. The best-known effect of the hormone,\nhowever, is the promotion of fruit ripening. Ethylene stimulates the conversion of starch and acids to sugars. Some people store\nunripe fruit, such as avocadoes, in a sealed paper bag to accelerate ripening; the gas released by the first fruit to mature will\nspeed up the maturation of the remaining fruit. Ethylene also triggers leaf and fruit abscission, flower fading and dropping,\nand promotes germination in some cereals and sprouting of bulbs and potatoes.\nEthylene is widely used in agriculture. Commercial fruit growers control the timing of fruit ripening with application of the gas.\nHorticulturalists inhibit leaf dropping in ornamental plants by removing ethylene from greenhouses using fans and ventilation.\nNontraditional Hormones\nRecent research has discovered a number of compounds that also influence plant development. Their roles are less understood\nthan the effects of the major hormones described so far.\nJasmonates play a major role in defense responses to herbivory. Their levels increase when a plant is wounded by a predator,\nresulting in an increase in toxic secondary metabolites. They contribute to the production of volatile compounds that attract\nnatural enemies of predators. For example, chewing of tomato plants by caterpillars leads to an increase in jasmonic acid levels,\nwhich in turn triggers the release of volatile compounds that attract predators of the pest.\nOligosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections. They act locally at the site of injury, and\ncan also be transported to other tissues. Strigolactones promote seed germination in some species and inhibit lateral apical\ndevelopment in the absence of auxins. Strigolactones also play a role in the establishment of mycorrhizae, a mutualistic\nassociation of plant roots and fungi. Brassinosteroids are important to many developmental and physiological processes.\nSignals between these compounds and other hormones, notably auxin and GAs, amplifies their physiological effect. Apical\ndominance, seed germination, gravitropism, and resistance to freezing are all positively influenced by hormones. Root growth\nand fruit dropping are inhibited by steroids.\nPlant Responses to Wind and Touch\nThe shoot of a pea plant winds around a trellis, while a tree grows on an angle in response to strong prevailing winds. These are\nexamples of how plants respond to touch or wind.\nThe movement of a plant subjected to constant directional pressure is called thigmotropism, from the Greek words thigma\nmeaning \u201ctouch,\u201d and tropism implying \u201cdirection.\u201d Tendrils are one example of this. The meristematic region of tendrils is very\ntouch sensitive; light touch will evoke a quick coiling response. Cells in contact with a support surface contract, whereas cells on\nthe opposite side of the support expand (Figure 30.14). Application of jasmonic acid is sufficient to trigger tendril coiling\nwithout a mechanical stimulus.\nA thigmonastic response is a touch response independent of the direction of stimulus Figure 30.24. In the Venus flytrap, two\nmodified leaves are joined at a hinge and lined with thin fork-like tines along the outer edges. Tiny hairs are located inside the\ntrap. When an insect brushes against these trigger hairs, touching two or more of them in succession, the leaves close quickly,\ntrapping the prey. Glands on the leaf surface secrete enzymes that slowly digest the insect. The released nutrients are absorbed\nby the leaves, which reopen for the next meal.\nThigmomorphogenesis is a slow developmental change in the shape of a plant subjected to continuous mechanical stress. When\ntrees bend in the wind, for example, growth is usually stunted and the trunk thickens. Strengthening tissue, especially xylem, is\nproduced to add stiffness to resist the wind\u2019s force. Researchers hypothesize that mechanical strain induces growth and\ndifferentiation to strengthen the tissues. Ethylene and jasmonate are likely involved in thigmomorphogenesis.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse the menu at the left to navigate to three short movies: (http://openstax.org/l/nastic_mvmt) a Venus fly trap capturing prey,\nthe progressive closing of sensitive plant leaflets, and the twining of tendrils.\n862\nChapter 30 \u2022 Plant Form and Physiology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nDefense Responses against Herbivores and Pathogens\nPlants face two types of enemies: herbivores and pathogens. Herbivores both large and small use plants as food, and actively\nchew them. Pathogens are agents of disease. These infectious microorganisms, such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes, live off\nof the plant and damage its tissues. Plants have developed a variety of strategies to discourage or kill attackers.\nThe first line of defense in plants is an intact and impenetrable barrier. Bark and the waxy cuticle can protect against predators.\nOther adaptations against herbivory include thorns, which are modified branches, and spines, which are modified leaves. They\ndiscourage animals by causing physical damage and inducing rashes and allergic reactions. A plant\u2019s exterior protection can be\ncompromised by mechanical damage, which may provide an entry point for pathogens. If the first line of defense is breached,\nthe plant must resort to a different set of defense mechanisms, such as toxins and enzymes.\nSecondary metabolites are compounds that are not directly derived from photosynthesis and are not necessary for respiration or\nplant growth and development. Many metabolites are toxic, and can even be lethal to animals that ingest them. Some\nmetabolites are alkaloids, which discourage predators with noxious odors (such as the volatile oils of mint and sage) or repellent\ntastes (like the bitterness of quinine). Other alkaloids affect herbivores by causing either excessive stimulation (caffeine is one\nexample) or the lethargy associated with opioids. Some compounds become toxic after ingestion. For instance, glycol cyanide in\nthe cassava root releases cyanide only upon ingestion; the nearly 500 million humans who rely on cassava for nutrition must be\ncertain to process the root properly before eating.\nMechanical wounding and predator attacks activate defense and protection mechanisms both in the damaged tissue and at sites\nfarther from the injury location. Some defense reactions occur within minutes: others over several hours. The infected and\nsurrounding cells may die, thereby stopping the spread of infection.\nLong-distance signaling elicits a systemic response aimed at deterring the predator. As tissue is damaged, jasmonates may\npromote the synthesis of compounds that are toxic to predators. Jasmonates also elicit the synthesis of volatile compounds that\nattract parasitoids, which are insects that spend their developing stages in or on another insect, and eventually kill their host.\nThe plant may activate abscission of injured tissue if it is damaged beyond repair.\n30.6 \u2022 Plant Sensory Systems and Responses\n863\n", "key_terms": "\nabscisic acid (ABA)\nplant hormone that induces dormancy\nin seeds and other organs\nabscission\nphysiological process that leads to the fall of a\nplant organ (such as leaf or petal drop)\nadventitious root\naboveground root that arises from a\nplant part other than the radicle of the plant embryo\napical bud\nbud formed at the tip of the shoot\napical meristem\nmeristematic tissue located at the tips of\nstems and roots;

The shoot system includes the\naboveground vegetative portions (stems and leaves) and\nreproductive parts (flowers and fruits). The root system\nsupports the plant and is usually underground. A plant is\ncomposed of two main types of tissue: meristematic tissue\nand permanent tissue. Meristematic tissue consists of\nactively dividing cells found in root and shoot tips. As growth\noccurs, meristematic tissue differentiates into permanent\ntissue, which is categorized as either simple or complex.\nSimple tissues are made up of similar cell types; examples\ninclude dermal tissue and ground tissue. Dermal tissue\nChapter 30 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n865\nprovides the outer covering of the plant. Ground tissue is\nresponsible for photosynthesis; it also supports vascular\ntissue and may store water and sugars. Complex tissues are\nmade up of different cell types. Vascular tissue, for example,\nis made up of xylem and phloem cells.\n30.2 Stems\nThe stem of a plant bears the leaves, flowers, and fruits.\nStems are characterized by the presence of nodes (the points\nof attachment for leaves or branches) and internodes\n(regions between nodes).\nPlant organs are made up of simple and complex tissues. The\nstem has three tissue systems: dermal, vascular, and ground\ntissue. Dermal tissue is the outer covering of the plant. It\ncontains epidermal cells, stomata, guard cells, and\ntrichomes. Vascular tissue is made up of xylem and phloem\ntissues and conducts water, minerals, and photosynthetic\nproducts. Ground tissue is responsible for photosynthesis\nand support and is composed of parenchyma, collenchyma,\nand sclerenchyma cells.\nPrimary growth occurs at the tips of roots and shoots,\ncausing an increase in length. Woody plants may also exhibit\nsecondary growth, or increase in thickness. In woody plants,\nespecially trees, annual rings may form as growth slows at\nthe end of each season. Some plant species have modified\nstems that help to store food, propagate new plants, or\ndiscourage predators. Rhizomes, corms, stolons, runners,\ntubers, bulbs, tendrils, and thorns are examples of modified\nstems.\n30.3 Roots\nRoots help to anchor a plant, absorb water and minerals, and\nserve as storage sites for food. Taproots and fibrous roots are\nthe two main types of root systems. In a taproot system, a\nmain root grows vertically downward with a few lateral\nroots. Fibrous root systems arise at the base of the stem,\nwhere a cluster of roots forms a dense network that is\nshallower than a taproot. The growing root tip is protected by\na root cap. The root tip has three main zones: a zone of cell\ndivision (cells are actively dividing), a zone of elongation\n(cells increase in length), and a zone of maturation (cells\ndifferentiate to form different kinds of cells). Root vascular\ntissue conducts water, minerals, and sugars. In some\nhabitats, the roots of certain plants may be modified to form\naerial roots or epiphytic roots.\n30.4 Leaves\nLeaves are the main site of photosynthesis. A typical leaf\nconsists of a lamina (the broad part of the leaf, also called the\nblade) and a petiole (the stalk that attaches the leaf to a\nstem). The arrangement of leaves on a stem, known as\nphyllotaxy, enables maximum exposure to sunlight. Each\nplant species has a characteristic leaf arrangement and form.\nThe pattern of leaf arrangement may be alternate, opposite,\nor spiral, while leaf form may be simple or compound. Leaf\ntissue consists of the epidermis, which forms the outermost\ncell layer, and mesophyll and vascular tissue, which make up\nthe inner portion of the leaf. In some plant species, leaf form\nis modified to form structures such as tendrils, spines, bud\nscales, and needles.\n30.5 Transport of Water and\nSolutes in Plants\nWater potential (\u03a8) is a measure of the difference in\npotential energy between a water sample and pure water. The\nwater potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute\nconcentration, pressure, gravity, and matric potential. Water\npotential and transpiration influence how water is\ntransported through the xylem in plants. These processes are\nregulated by stomatal opening and closing. Photosynthates\n(mainly sucrose) move from sources to sinks through the\nplant\u2019s phloem. Sucrose is actively loaded into the sieve-tube\nelements of the phloem. The increased solute concentration\ncauses water to move by osmosis from the xylem into the\nphloem. The positive pressure that is produced pushes water\nand solutes down the pressure gradient. The sucrose is\nunloaded into the sink, and the water returns to the xylem\nvessels.\n30.6 Plant Sensory Systems and\nResponses\nPlants respond to light by changes in morphology and\nactivity. Irradiation by red light converts the photoreceptor\nphytochrome to its far-red light-absorbing form\u2014Pfr. This\nform controls germination and flowering in response to\nlength of day, as well as triggers photosynthesis in dormant\nplants or those that just emerged from the soil. Blue-light\nreceptors, cryptochromes, and phototropins are responsible\nfor phototropism. Amyloplasts, which contain heavy starch\ngranules, sense gravity. Shoots exhibit negative\ngravitropism, whereas roots exhibit positive gravitropism.\nPlant hormones\u2014naturally occurring compounds\nsynthesized in small amounts\u2014can act both in the cells that\nproduce them and in distant tissues and organs. Auxins are\nresponsible for apical dominance, root growth, directional\ngrowth toward light, and many other growth responses.\nCytokinins stimulate cell division and counter apical\ndominance in shoots. Gibberellins inhibit dormancy of seeds\nand promote stem growth. Abscisic acid induces dormancy\nin seeds and buds, and protects plants from excessive water\nloss by promoting stomatal closure. Ethylene gas speeds up\nfruit ripening and dropping of leaves. Plants respond to\ntouch by rapid movements (thigmotropy and thigmonasty)\nand slow differential growth (thigmomorphogenesis). Plants\nhave evolved defense mechanisms against predators and\n866\nChapter 30 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\npathogens. Physical barriers like bark and spines protect\ntender tissues. Plants also have chemical defenses, including\ntoxic secondary metabolites and hormones, which elicit\nadditional defense mechanisms.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

Soil quality and climate are the major determinants of plant\ndistribution and growth. The combination of soil nutrients, water, and carbon dioxide, along with sunlight,\nallows plants to grow.\nThe Chemical Composition of Plants\nSince plants require nutrients in the form of elements such as carbon and potassium, it is important to\nunderstand the chemical composition of plants. The majority of volume in a plant cell is water; it typically\nFigure 31.1 For this (a) squash seedling (Cucurbita maxima) to develop into a mature plant\nbearing its (b) fruit, numerous nutritional requirements must be met.

The family includes many edible species, such as squash and\npumpkin, as well as inedible gourds. In order to grow and develop into mature, fruit-bearing plants,\nmany requirements must be met and events must be coordinated. Seeds must germinate under the right\nconditions in the soil; therefore, temperature, moisture, and soil quality are important factors that play a\nrole in germination and seedling development. Soil quality and climate are significant to plant\ndistribution and growth. The young seedling will eventually grow into a mature plant, and the roots will\nabsorb nutrients and water from the soil. At the same time, the aboveground parts of the plant will\nabsorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use energy from sunlight to produce organic\ncompounds through photosynthesis. This chapter will explore the complex dynamics between plants and\nsoils, and the adaptations that plants have evolved to make better use of nutritional resources.\nChapter Outline\n31.1 Nutritional\nRequirements of\nPlants\n31.2 The Soil\n31.3 Nutritional\nAdaptations of\nPlants\ncomprises 80 to 90 percent of the plant\u2019s total weight. Soil is the water source for land plants, and can be an\nabundant source of water, even if it appears dry. Plant roots absorb water from the soil through root hairs\nand transport it up to the leaves through the xylem. As water vapor is lost from the leaves, the process of\ntranspiration and the polarity of water molecules (which enables them to form hydrogen bonds) draws more\nwater from the roots up through the plant to the leaves (Figure 31.2). Plants need water to support cell\nstructure, for metabolic functions, to carry nutrients, and for photosynthesis.\nFigure 31.2 Water is absorbed through the root hairs and moves up the xylem to the leaves.\nPlant cells need essential substances, collectively called nutrients, to sustain life. Plant nutrients may be\ncomposed of either organic or inorganic compounds. An organic compound is a chemical compound that\ncontains carbon, such as carbon dioxide obtained from the atmosphere. Carbon that was obtained from\natmospheric CO2 composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants. An inorganic compound does\nnot contain carbon and is not part of, or produced by, a living organism. Inorganic substances, which form\nthe majority of the soil solution, are commonly called minerals: those required by plants include nitrogen (N)\nand potassium (K) for structure and regulation.\nEssential Nutrients\nPlants require only light, water, and about 20 elements to support all their biochemical needs: these 20\nelements are called essential nutrients (Table 31.1). For an element to be regarded as essential, three criteria\nare required: 1) a plant cannot complete its life cycle without the element; 2) no other element can perform\nthe function of the element; and 3) the element is directly involved in plant nutrition.\nEssential Elements for Plant Growth\nMacronutrients\nMicronutrients\nCarbon (C)\nIron (Fe)\nHydrogen (H)\nManganese (Mn)\nOxygen (O)\nBoron (B)\nTable 31.1\n872\nChapter 31 \u2022 Soil and Plant Nutrition\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nMacronutrients\nMicronutrients\nNitrogen (N)\nMolybdenum (Mo)\nPhosphorus (P)\nCopper (Cu)\nPotassium (K)\nZinc (Zn)\nCalcium (Ca)\nChlorine (Cl)\nMagnesium (Mg)\nNickel (Ni)\nSulfur (S)\nCobalt (Co)\nSodium (Na)\nSilicon (Si)\nTable 31.1\nMacronutrients and Micronutrients\nThe essential elements can be divided into two groups: macronutrients and micronutrients. Nutrients that plants require in\nlarger amounts are called macronutrients. About half of the essential elements are considered macronutrients: carbon,\nhydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sulfur. The first of these macronutrients, carbon\n(C), is required to form carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and many other compounds; it is therefore present in all\nmacromolecules. On average, the dry weight (excluding water) of a cell is 50 percent carbon. As shown in Figure 31.3, carbon is a\nkey part of plant biomolecules.\nFigure 31.3 Cellulose, the main structural component of the plant cell wall, makes up over thirty percent of plant matter. It is the most\nabundant organic compound on earth.\nThe next most abundant element in plant cells is nitrogen (N); it is part of proteins and nucleic acids. Nitrogen is also used in the\nsynthesis of some vitamins. Hydrogen and oxygen are macronutrients that are part of many organic compounds, and also form\nwater. Oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration; plants use oxygen to store energy in the form of ATP. Phosphorus (P), another\nmacromolecule, is necessary to synthesize nucleic acids and phospholipids. As part of ATP, phosphorus enables food energy to\nbe converted into chemical energy through oxidative phosphorylation. Likewise, light energy is converted into chemical energy\nduring photophosphorylation in photosynthesis, and into chemical energy to be extracted during respiration. Sulfur is part of\n31.1 \u2022 Nutritional Requirements of Plants\n873\ncertain amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine, and is present in several coenzymes. Sulfur also plays a role in\nphotosynthesis as part of the electron transport chain, where hydrogen gradients play a key role in the conversion of light energy\ninto ATP. Potassium (K) is important because of its role in regulating stomatal opening and closing. As the openings for gas\nexchange, stomata help maintain a healthy water balance; a potassium ion pump supports this process.\nMagnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) are also important macronutrients. The role of calcium is twofold: to regulate nutrient\ntransport, and to support many enzyme functions. Magnesium is important to the photosynthetic process. These minerals,\nalong with the micronutrients, which are described below, also contribute to the plant\u2019s ionic balance.\nIn addition to macronutrients, organisms require various elements in small amounts. These micronutrients, or trace elements,\nare present in very small quantities. They include boron (B), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu),\nmolybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), silicon (Si), and sodium (Na).\nDeficiencies in any of these nutrients\u2014particularly the macronutrients\u2014can adversely affect plant growth (Figure 31.4).\nDepending on the specific nutrient, a lack can cause stunted growth, slow growth, or chlorosis (yellowing of the leaves). Extreme\ndeficiencies may result in leaves showing signs of cell death.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/plant_mineral) to participate in an interactive experiment on plant nutrient\ndeficiencies. You can adjust the amounts of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Fe that plants receive . . . and see what happens.\nFigure 31.4 Nutrient deficiency is evident in the symptoms these plants show. This (a) grape tomato suffers from blossom end rot caused\nby calcium deficiency. The yellowing in this (b) Frangula alnus results from magnesium deficiency. Inadequate magnesium also leads to (c)\nintervenal chlorosis, seen here in a sweetgum leaf. This (d) palm is affected by potassium deficiency.

Soil is the outer loose layer\nthat covers the surface of Earth. Soil quality is a major determinant, along with climate, of plant distribution and growth. Soil\nquality depends not only on the chemical composition of the soil, but also the topography (regional surface features) and the\npresence of living organisms. In agriculture, the history of the soil, such as the cultivating practices and previous crops, modify\nthe characteristics and fertility of that soil.\nSoil develops very slowly over long periods of time, and its formation results from natural and environmental forces acting on\nmineral, rock, and organic compounds. Soils can be divided into two groups: organic soils are those that are formed from\nsedimentation and primarily composed of organic matter, while those that are formed from the weathering of rocks and are\nprimarily composed of inorganic material are called mineral soils. Mineral soils are predominant in terrestrial ecosystems,\nwhere soils may be covered by water for part of the year or exposed to the atmosphere.\nEveryday Connection\nHydroponics\nFigure 31.5 Plant physiologist Ray Wheeler checks onions being grown using hydroponic techniques. The other plants are Bibb lettuce\n(left) and radishes (right). Credit: NASA\nHydroponics is a method of growing plants in a water-nutrient solution instead of soil. Since its advent, hydroponics has\ndeveloped into a growing process that researchers often use. Scientists who are interested in studying plant nutrient\ndeficiencies can use hydroponics to study the effects of different nutrient combinations under strictly controlled conditions.\nHydroponics has also developed as a way to grow flowers, vegetables, and other crops in greenhouse environments. You\nmight find hydroponically grown produce at your local grocery store. Today, many lettuces and tomatoes in your market\nhave been hydroponically grown.\n31.2 \u2022 The Soil\n875\nSoil Composition\nSoil consists of these major components (Figure 31.6):\n\u2022\ninorganic mineral matter, about 40 to 45 percent of the soil volume\n\u2022\norganic matter, about 5 percent of the soil volume\n\u2022\nwater and air, about 50 percent of the soil volume\nThe amount of each of the four major components of soil depends on the amount of vegetation, soil compaction, and water\npresent in the soil. A good healthy soil has sufficient air, water, minerals, and organic material to promote and sustain plant life.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 31.6 The four major components of soil are shown: inorganic minerals, organic matter, water, and air.\nSoil compaction can result when soil is compressed by heavy machinery or even foot traffic. How might this compaction change\nthe soil composition?\nThe organic material of soil, called humus, is made up of microorganisms (dead and alive), and dead animals and plants in\nvarying stages of decay. Humus improves soil structure and provides plants with water and minerals. The inorganic material of\nsoil consists of rock, slowly broken down into smaller particles that vary in size. Soil particles that are 0.1 to 2 mm in diameter\nare sand. Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1 mm are called silt, and even smaller particles, less than 0.002 mm in diameter,\nare called clay. Some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand, silt, and humus; these soils are called\nloams.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nExplore this interactive map (http://openstax.org/l/soil_survey_map) from the USDA\u2019s National Cooperative Soil Survey to\naccess soil data for almost any region in the United States.\nSoil Formation\nSoil formation is the consequence of a combination of biological, physical, and chemical processes. Soil should ideally contain 50\npercent solid material and 50 percent pore space. About one-half of the pore space should contain water, and the other half\nshould contain air. The organic component of soil serves as a cementing agent, returns nutrients to the plant, allows soil to store\nmoisture, makes soil tillable for farming, and provides energy for soil microorganisms. Most soil microorganisms\u2014bacteria,\nalgae, or fungi\u2014are dormant in dry soil, but become active once moisture is available.\n876\nChapter 31 \u2022 Soil and Plant Nutrition\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nSoil distribution is not homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers; together, the vertical section of a\nsoil is called the soil profile. Within the soil profile, soil scientists define zones called horizons. A horizon is a soil layer with\ndistinct physical and chemical properties that differ from those of other layers. Five factors account for soil formation: parent\nmaterial, climate, topography, biological factors, and time.\nParent Material\nThe organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material. Mineral soils form directly from the weathering\nof bedrock, the solid rock that lies beneath the soil, and therefore, they have a similar composition to the original rock. Other\nsoils form in materials that came from elsewhere, such as sand and glacial drift. Materials located in the depth of the soil are\nrelatively unchanged compared with the deposited material. Sediments in rivers may have different characteristics, depending\non whether the stream moves quickly or slowly. A fast-moving river could have sediments of rocks and sand, whereas a slow-\nmoving river could have fine-textured material, such as clay.\nClimate\nTemperature, moisture, and wind cause different patterns of weathering and therefore affect soil characteristics. The presence\nof moisture and nutrients from weathering will also promote biological activity: a key component of a quality soil.\nTopography\nRegional surface features (familiarly called \u201cthe lay of the land\u201d) can have a major influence on the characteristics and fertility of\na soil. Topography affects water runoff, which strips away parent material and affects plant growth. Steeps soils are more prone\nto erosion and may be thinner than soils that are relatively flat or level.\nBiological factors\nThe presence of living organisms greatly affects soil formation and structure. Animals and microorganisms can produce pores\nand crevices, and plant roots can penetrate into crevices to produce more fragmentation. Plant secretions promote the\ndevelopment of microorganisms around the root, in an area known as the rhizosphere. Additionally, leaves and other material\nthat fall from plants decompose and contribute to soil composition.\nTime\nTime is an important factor in soil formation because soils develop over long periods. Soil formation is a dynamic process.\nMaterials are deposited over time, decompose, and transform into other materials that can be used by living organisms or\ndeposited onto the surface of the soil.\nPhysical Properties of the Soil\nSoils are named and classified based on their horizons. The soil profile has four distinct layers: 1) O horizon; 2) A horizon; 3) B\nhorizon, or subsoil; and 4) C horizon, or soil base (Figure 31.7). The O horizon has freshly decomposing organic\nmatter\u2014humus\u2014at its surface, with decomposed vegetation at its base. Humus enriches the soil with nutrients and enhances\nsoil moisture retention. Topsoil\u2014the top layer of soil\u2014is usually two to three inches deep, but this depth can vary considerably.\nFor instance, river deltas like the Mississippi River delta have deep layers of topsoil. Topsoil is rich in organic material; microbial\nprocesses occur there, and it is the \u201cworkhorse\u201d of plant production. The A horizon consists of a mixture of organic material\nwith inorganic products of weathering, and it is therefore the beginning of true mineral soil. This horizon is typically darkly\ncolored because of the presence of organic matter. In this area, rainwater percolates through the soil and carries materials from\nthe surface. The B horizon is an accumulation of mostly fine material that has moved downward, resulting in a dense layer in the\nsoil. In some soils, the B horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium carbonate. The C horizon, or soil base, includes the\nparent material, plus the organic and inorganic material that is broken down to form soil. The parent material may be either\ncreated in its natural place, or transported from elsewhere to its present location. Beneath the C horizon lies bedrock.\n31.2 \u2022 The Soil\n877\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 31.7 This soil profile shows the different soil layers (O horizon, A horizon, B horizon, and C horizon) found in typical soils. (credit:\nmodification of work by USDA)\nWhich horizon is considered the topsoil, and which is considered the subsoil?\nSome soils may have additional layers, or lack one of these layers. The thickness of the layers is also variable, and depends on the\nfactors that influence soil formation. In general, immature soils may have O, A, and C horizons, whereas mature soils may\ndisplay all of these, plus additional layers (Figure 31.8).\nFigure 31.8 The San Joaquin soil profile has an O horizon, A horizon, B horizon, and C horizon.

Soil scientists need to have a strong background in physical and life sciences, plus a foundation in mathematics. They may\nwork for federal or state agencies, academia, or the private sector. Their work may involve collecting data, carrying out research,\ninterpreting results, inspecting soils, conducting soil surveys, and recommending soil management programs.\nFigure 31.9 This soil scientist is studying the horizons and composition of soil at a research site. (credit: USDA)\nMany soil scientists work both in an office and in the field. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA): \u201ca\nsoil scientist needs good observation skills to analyze and determine the characteristics of different types of soils. Soil types are\ncomplex and the geographical areas a soil scientist may survey are varied. Aerial photos or various satellite images are often\nused to research the areas. Computer skills and geographic information systems (GIS) help the scientist to analyze the multiple\nfacets of geomorphology, topography, vegetation, and climate to discover the patterns left on the landscape.\u201d1 Soil scientists play\na key role in understanding the soil\u2019s past, analyzing present conditions, and making recommendations for future soil-related\npractices.\n31.3 Nutritional Adaptations of Plants\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nUnderstand the nutritional adaptations of plants\n\u2022\nDescribe mycorrhizae\n\u2022\nExplain nitrogen fixation\nPlants obtain food in two different ways. Autotrophic plants can make their own food from inorganic raw materials, such as\ncarbon dioxide and water, through photosynthesis in the presence of sunlight. Green plants are included in this group. Some\nplants, however, are heterotrophic: they are totally parasitic and lacking in chlorophyll. These plants, referred to as holo-\nparasitic plants, are unable to synthesize organic carbon and draw all of their nutrients from the host plant.\n1National Resources Conservation Service / United States Department of Agriculture. \u201cCareers in Soil Science.\u201d http://openstax.org/l/NRCS\n(http://openstax.org/l/NRCS)\n31.3 \u2022 Nutritional Adaptations of Plants\n879\nPlants may also enlist the help of microbial partners in nutrient acquisition. Particular species of bacteria and fungi have\nevolved along with certain plants to create a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with roots. This improves the nutrition of both\nthe plant and the microbe. The formation of nodules in legume plants and mycorrhization can be considered among the\nnutritional adaptations of plants. However, these are not the only type of adaptations that we may find; many plants have other\nadaptations that allow them to thrive under specific conditions.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis video (http://openstax.org/l/basic_photosyn) reviews basic concepts about photosynthesis. In the left panel, click each tab\nto select a topic for review.\nNitrogen Fixation: Root and Bacteria Interactions\nNitrogen is an important macronutrient because it is part of nucleic acids and proteins. Atmospheric nitrogen, which is the\ndiatomic molecule N2, or dinitrogen, is the largest pool of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. However, plants cannot take\nadvantage of this nitrogen because they do not have the necessary enzymes to convert it into biologically useful forms. However,\nnitrogen can be \u201cfixed,\u201d which means that it can be converted to ammonia (NH3) through biological, physical, or chemical\nprocesses. As you have learned, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia\n(NH3), exclusively carried out by prokaryotes such as soil bacteria or cyanobacteria. Biological processes contribute 65 percent of\nthe nitrogen used in agriculture. The following equation represents the process:\nThe most important source of BNF is the symbiotic interaction between soil bacteria and legume plants, including many crops\nimportant to humans (Figure 31.10). The NH3 resulting from fixation can be transported into plant tissue and incorporated into\namino acids, which are then made into plant proteins. Some legume seeds, such as soybeans and peanuts, contain high levels of\nprotein, and serve among the most important agricultural sources of protein in the world.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 31.10 Some common edible legumes\u2014like (a) peanuts, (b) beans, and (c) chickpeas\u2014are able to interact symbiotically with soil\nbacteria that fix nitrogen. (credit a: modification of work by Jules Clancy; credit b: modification of work by USDA)\nFarmers often rotate corn (a cereal crop) and soy beans (a legume), planting a field with each crop in alternate seasons. What\nadvantage might this crop rotation confer?\nSoil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules,\nin which nitrogen fixation takes place. This process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, by means of the\nenzyme nitrogenase. Therefore, using rhizobia is a natural and environmentally friendly way to fertilize plants, as opposed to\nchemical fertilization that uses a nonrenewable resource, such as natural gas. Through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the plant\nbenefits from using an endless source of nitrogen from the atmosphere. The process simultaneously contributes to soil fertility\nbecause the plant root system leaves behind some of the biologically available nitrogen. As in any symbiosis, both organisms\nbenefit from the interaction: the plant obtains ammonia, and bacteria obtain carbon compounds generated through\nphotosynthesis, as well as a protected niche in which to grow (Figure 31.11).\n880\nChapter 31 \u2022 Soil and Plant Nutrition\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 31.11 Soybean roots contain (a) nitrogen-fixing nodules.

These conditions are very common; therefore, most plants rely on fungi to facilitate the uptake of minerals\nfrom the soil. Fungi form symbiotic associations called mycorrhizae with plant roots, in which the fungi actually are integrated\ninto the physical structure of the root. The fungi colonize the living root tissue during active plant growth.\nThrough mycorrhization, the plant obtains mainly phosphate and other minerals, such as zinc and copper, from the soil. The\nfungus obtains nutrients, such as sugars, from the plant root (Figure 31.12). Mycorrhizae help increase the surface area of the\nplant root system because hyphae, which are narrow, can spread beyond the nutrient depletion zone. Hyphae can grow into\nsmall soil pores that allow access to phosphorus that would otherwise be unavailable to the plant. The beneficial effect on the\nplant is best observed in poor soils. The benefit to fungi is that they can obtain up to 20 percent of the total carbon accessed by\nplants. Mycorrhizae functions as a physical barrier to pathogens. It also provides an induction of generalized host defense\nmechanisms, and sometimes involves production of antibiotic compounds by the fungi.\nFigure 31.12 Root tips proliferate in the presence of mycorrhizal infection, which appears as off-white fuzz in this image. (credit:\nmodification of work by Nilsson et al., BMC Bioinformatics 2005)\nThere are two types of mycorrhizae: ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae form an extensive dense sheath\naround the roots, called a mantle. Hyphae from the fungi extend from the mantle into the soil, which increases the surface area\nfor water and mineral absorption. This type of mycorrhizae is found in forest trees, especially conifers, birches, and oaks.\nEndomycorrhizae, also called arbuscular mycorrhizae, do not form a dense sheath over the root. Instead, the fungal mycelium is\nembedded within the root tissue. Endomycorrhizae are found in the roots of more than 80 percent of terrestrial plants.\n31.3 \u2022 Nutritional Adaptations of Plants\n881\nNutrients from Other Sources\nSome plants cannot produce their own food and must obtain their nutrition from outside sources. This may occur with plants\nthat are parasitic or saprophytic. Some plants are mutualistic symbionts, epiphytes, or insectivorous.\nPlant Parasites\nA parasitic plant depends on its host for survival. Some parasitic plants have no leaves. An example of this is the dodder (Figure\n31.13), which has a weak, cylindrical stem that coils around the host and forms suckers. From these suckers, cells invade the host\nstem and grow to connect with the vascular bundles of the host. The parasitic plant obtains water and nutrients through these\nconnections. The plant is a total parasite (a holoparasite) because it is completely dependent on its host. Other parasitic plants\n(hemiparasites) are fully photosynthetic and only use the host for water and minerals. There are about 4,100 species of parasitic\nplants.\nFigure 31.13 The dodder is a holoparasite that penetrates the host\u2019s vascular tissue and diverts nutrients for its own growth. Note that the\nvines of the dodder, which has white flowers, are beige. The dodder has no chlorophyll and cannot produce its own food. (credit:\n\"Lalithamba\"/Flickr)\nSaprophytes\nA saprophyte is a plant that does not have chlorophyll and gets its food from dead matter, similar to bacteria and fungi (note\nthat fungi are often called saprophytes, which is incorrect, because fungi are not plants). Plants like these use enzymes to\nconvert organic food materials into simpler forms from which they can absorb nutrients (Figure 31.14). Most saprophytes do not\ndirectly digest dead matter: instead, they parasitize fungi that digest dead matter, or are mycorrhizal, ultimately obtaining\nphotosynthate from a fungus that derived photosynthate from its host. Saprophytic plants are uncommon; only a few species\nare described.\n882\nChapter 31 \u2022 Soil and Plant Nutrition\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 31.14 Saprophytes, like this Dutchmen\u2019s pipe (Monotropa hypopitys), obtain their food from dead matter and do not have\nchlorophyll. (credit: modification of work by Iwona Erskine-Kellie)\nSymbionts\nA symbiont is a plant in a symbiotic relationship, with special adaptations such as mycorrhizae or nodule formation. Fungi also\nform symbiotic associations with cyanobacteria and green algae (called lichens). Lichens can sometimes be seen as colorful\ngrowths on the surface of rocks and trees (Figure 31.15). The algal partner (phycobiont) makes food autotrophically, some of\nwhich it shares with the fungus; the fungal partner (mycobiont) absorbs water and minerals from the environment, which are\nmade available to the green alga. If one partner was separated from the other, they would both die.\nFigure 31.15 Lichens, which often have symbiotic relationships with other plants, can sometimes be found growing on trees. (credit:\n\"benketaro\"/Flickr)\nEpiphytes\nAn epiphyte is a plant that grows on other plants, but is not dependent upon the other plant for nutrition (Figure 31.16).\nEpiphytes have two types of roots: clinging aerial roots, which absorb nutrients from humus that accumulates in the crevices of\ntrees; and aerial roots, which absorb moisture from the atmosphere.\n31.3 \u2022 Nutritional Adaptations of Plants\n883\nFigure 31.16 These epiphyte plants grow in the main greenhouse of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris.\nInsectivorous Plants\nAn insectivorous plant has specialized leaves to attract and digest insects. The Venus flytrap is popularly known for its\ninsectivorous mode of nutrition, and has leaves that work as traps (Figure 31.17). The minerals it obtains from prey compensate\nfor those lacking in the boggy (low pH) soil of its native North Carolina coastal plains. There are three sensitive hairs in the\ncenter of each half of each leaf. The edges of each leaf are covered with long spines. Nectar secreted by the plant attracts flies to\nthe leaf.

Inorganic compounds form the majority of\nthe soil solution. Plants access water though the soil. Water\nis absorbed by the plant root, transports nutrients\nthroughout the plant, and maintains the structure of the\nplant. Essential elements are indispensable elements for\nplant growth. They are divided into macronutrients and\nmicronutrients. The macronutrients plants require are\ncarbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus,\npotassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Important\nmicronutrients include iron, manganese, boron,\nmolybdenum, copper, zinc, chlorine, nickel, cobalt, silicon,\nand sodium.\n31.2 The Soil\nPlants obtain mineral nutrients from the soil. Soil is the\nouter loose layer that covers the surface of Earth. Soil quality\ndepends on the chemical composition of the soil, the\ntopography, the presence of living organisms, the climate,\nand time. Agricultural practice and history may also modify\nthe characteristics and fertility of soil. Soil consists of four\nmajor components: 1) inorganic mineral matter, 2) organic\nmatter, 3) water and air, and 4) living matter. The organic\nmaterial of soil is made of humus, which improves soil\nstructure and provides water and minerals. Soil inorganic\nmaterial consists of rock slowly broken down into smaller\nparticles that vary in size, such as sand, silt, and loam.\nSoil formation results from a combination of biological,\nphysical, and chemical processes. Soil is not homogenous\nbecause its formation results in the production of layers\ncalled a soil profile. Factors that affect soil formation include:\nparent material, climate, topography, biological factors, and\ntime. Soils are classified based on their horizons, soil particle\nChapter 31 \u2022 Key Terms\n885\nsize, and proportions. Most soils have four distinct horizons:\nO, A, B, and C.\n31.3 Nutritional Adaptations of\nPlants\nAtmospheric nitrogen is the largest pool of available nitrogen\nin terrestrial ecosystems. However, plants cannot use this\nnitrogen because they do not have the necessary enzymes.\nBiological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the conversion of\natmospheric nitrogen to ammonia. The most important\nsource of BNF is the symbiotic interaction between soil\nbacteria and legumes. The bacteria form nodules on the\nlegume\u2019s roots in which nitrogen fixation takes place. Fungi\nform symbiotic associations (mycorrhizae) with plants,\nbecoming integrated into the physical structure of the root.\nThrough mycorrhization, the plant obtains minerals from\nthe soil and the fungus obtains photosynthate from the plant\nroot. Ectomycorrhizae form an extensive dense sheath\naround the root, while endomycorrhizae are embedded\nwithin the root tissue. Some plants\u2014parasites, saprophytes,\nsymbionts, epiphytes, and insectivores\u2014have evolved\nadaptations to obtain their organic or mineral nutrition\nfrom various sources.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

Plants have two distinct\nstages in their lifecycle: the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage. The haploid gametophyte produces\nthe male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures. Fusion of the male and females\ngametes forms the diploid zygote, which develops into the sporophyte. After reaching maturity, the diploid\nsporophyte produces spores by meiosis, which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid\ngametophyte. The new gametophyte produces gametes, and the cycle continues. This is the alternation of\ngenerations, and is typical of plant reproduction (Figure 32.2).\nFigure 32.1 Plants that reproduce sexually often achieve fertilization with the help of pollinators\nsuch as (a) bees, (b) birds, and (c) butterflies.

Sharp; credit c: modification of work by\n\"Galawebdesign\"/Flickr)\nINTRODUCTION Plants have evolved different reproductive strategies for the continuation of their\nspecies. Some plants reproduce sexually, and others asexually, in contrast to animal species, which rely\nalmost exclusively on sexual reproduction. Plant sexual reproduction usually depends on pollinating\nagents, while asexual reproduction is independent of these agents. Flowers are often the showiest or\nmost strongly scented part of plants. With their bright colors, fragrances, and interesting shapes and\nsizes, flowers attract insects, birds, and animals to serve their pollination needs. Other plants pollinate\nvia wind or water; still others self-pollinate.\nChapter Outline\n32.1 Reproductive\nDevelopment and\nStructure\n32.2 Pollination and\nFertilization\n32.3 Asexual\nReproduction\nFigure 32.2 The alternation of generations in angiosperms is depicted in this diagram. (credit: modification of work by\nPeter Coxhead)\nThe life cycle of higher plants is dominated by the sporophyte stage, with the gametophyte borne on the\nsporophyte. In ferns, the gametophyte is free-living and very distinct in structure from the diploid\nsporophyte. In bryophytes, such as mosses, the haploid gametophyte is more developed than the\nsporophyte.\nDuring the vegetative phase of growth, plants increase in size and produce a shoot system and a root\nsystem. As they enter the reproductive phase, some of the branches start to bear flowers. Many flowers are\nborne singly, whereas some are borne in clusters. The flower is borne on a stalk known as a receptacle.\nFlower shape, color, and size are unique to each species, and are often used by taxonomists to classify plants.\nSexual Reproduction in Angiosperms\nThe lifecycle of angiosperms follows the alternation of generations explained previously. The haploid\ngametophyte alternates with the diploid sporophyte during the sexual reproduction process of angiosperms.\nFlowers contain the plant\u2019s reproductive structures.\nFlower Structure\nA typical flower has four main parts\u2014or whorls\u2014known as the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium\n(Figure 32.3). The outermost whorl of the flower has green, leafy structures known as sepals. The sepals,\ncollectively called the calyx, help to protect the unopened bud. The second whorl is comprised of\npetals\u2014usually, brightly colored\u2014collectively called the corolla. The number of sepals and petals varies\ndepending on whether the plant is a monocot or dicot. In monocots, petals usually number three or\nmultiples of three; in dicots, the number of petals is four or five, or multiples of four and five. Together, the\ncalyx and corolla are known as the perianth. The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and\nis known as the androecium. The androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia.\nThe innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium, or the female reproductive component(s).\nThe carpel is the individual unit of the gynoecium and has a stigma, style, and ovary. A flower may have one\nor multiple carpels.\n890\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 32.3 The four main parts of the flower are the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. The androecium is the sum of all the male\nreproductive organs, and the gynoecium is the sum of the female reproductive organs. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz\nVillareal)\nIf the anther is missing, what type of reproductive structure will the flower be unable to produce? What term is used to describe\nan incomplete flower lacking the androecium? What term describes an incomplete flower lacking a gynoecium?\nIf all four whorls (the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium) are present, the flower is described as complete. If any of the\nfour parts is missing, the flower is known as incomplete. Flowers that contain both an androecium and a gynoecium are called\nperfect, androgynous or hermaphrodites. There are two types of incomplete flowers: staminate flowers contain only an\nandroecium, and carpellate flowers have only a gynoecium (Figure 32.4).\n32.1 \u2022 Reproductive Development and Structure\n891\nFigure 32.4 The corn plant has both staminate (male) and carpellate (female) flowers. Staminate flowers, which are clustered in the tassel\nat the tip of the stem, produce pollen grains. Carpellate flowers are clustered in the immature ears. Each strand of silk is a stigma. The corn\nkernels are seeds that develop on the ear after fertilization. Also shown is the lower stem and root.\nIf both male and female flowers are borne on the same plant, the species is called monoecious (meaning \u201cone home\u201d): examples\nare corn and pea. Species with male and female flowers borne on separate plants are termed dioecious, or \u201ctwo homes,\u201d\nexamples of which are C. papaya and Cannabis. The ovary, which may contain one or multiple ovules, may be placed above other\nflower parts, which is referred to as superior; or, it may be placed below the other flower parts, referred to as inferior (Figure\n32.5).\n892\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 32.5 The (a) lily is a superior flower, which has the ovary above the other flower parts.

In a plant\u2019s male reproductive organs,\ndevelopment of pollen takes place in a structure known as the microsporangium (Figure 32.6). The microsporangia, which are\nusually bilobed, are pollen sacs in which the microspores develop into pollen grains. These are found in the anther, which is at\nthe end of the stamen\u2014the long filament that supports the anther.\n32.1 \u2022 Reproductive Development and Structure\n893\nFigure 32.6 Shown is (a) a cross section of an anther at two developmental stages. The immature anther (top) contains four\nmicrosporangia, or pollen sacs. Each microsporangium contains hundreds of microspore mother cells that will each give rise to four pollen\ngrains. The tapetum supports the development and maturation of the pollen grains. Upon maturation of the pollen (bottom), the pollen sac\nwalls split open and the pollen grains (male gametophytes) are released, as shown in the (b) micrograph of an immature lily anther. In these\nscanning electron micrographs, pollen sacs are ready to burst, releasing their grains. (credit a: modification of work by LibreTexts; b:\nmodification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nWithin the microsporangium, each of the microspore mother cells divides by meiosis to give rise to four microspores, each of\nwhich will ultimately form a pollen grain (Figure 32.7). An inner layer of cells, known as the tapetum, provides nutrition to the\ndeveloping microspores and contributes key components to the pollen wall. Mature pollen grains contain two cells: a generative\ncell and a pollen tube cell. The generative cell is contained within the larger pollen tube cell. Upon germination, the tube cell\nforms the pollen tube through which the generative cell migrates to enter the ovary. During its transit inside the pollen tube, the\ngenerative cell divides to form two male gametes (sperm cells). Upon maturity, the microsporangia burst, releasing the pollen\ngrains from the anther.\n894\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 32.7 Pollen develops from the microspore mother cells. The mature pollen grain is composed of two cells: the pollen tube cell and\nthe generative cell, which is inside the tube cell. The pollen grain has two coverings: an inner layer (intine) and an outer layer (exine). The\ninset scanning electron micrograph shows Arabidopsis lyrata pollen grains. (credit \u201cpollen micrograph\u201d: modification of work by Robert R.\nWise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nEach pollen grain has two coverings: the exine (thicker, outer layer) and the intine (Figure 32.7). The exine contains\nsporopollenin, a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells. Sporopollenin allows the pollen to survive under\nunfavorable conditions and to be carried by wind, water, or biological agents without undergoing damage.\nFemale Gametophyte (The Embryo Sac)\nWhile the details may vary between species, the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases. First, in\nthe process of megasporogenesis, a single cell in the diploid megasporangium\u2014an area of tissue in the ovules\u2014undergoes\nmeiosis to produce four megaspores, only one of which survives. During the second phase, megagametogenesis, the surviving\nhaploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight-nucleate, seven-cell female gametophyte, also known as the\nmegagametophyte or embryo sac. Two of the nuclei\u2014the polar nuclei\u2014move to the equator and fuse, forming a single, diploid\ncentral cell. This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm. Three nuclei position themselves on the\nend of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells, which later degenerate. The nucleus closest to\nthe micropyle becomes the female gamete, or egg cell, and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells (Figure 32.8). The\nsynergids help guide the pollen tube for successful fertilization, after which they disintegrate. Once fertilization is complete, the\nresulting diploid zygote develops into the embryo, and the fertilized ovule forms the other tissues of the seed.\n32.1 \u2022 Reproductive Development and Structure\n895\nA double-layered integument protects the megasporangium and, later, the embryo sac. The integument will develop into the\nseed coat after fertilization and protect the entire seed. The ovule wall will become part of the fruit. The integuments, while\nprotecting the megasporangium, do not enclose it completely, but leave an opening called the micropyle. The micropyle allows\nthe pollen tube to enter the female gametophyte for fertilization.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 32.8 As shown in this diagram of the embryo sac in angiosperms, the ovule is covered by integuments and has an opening called a\nmicropyle. Inside the embryo sac are three antipodal cells, two synergids, a central cell, and the egg cell.\nAn embryo sac is missing the synergids. What specific impact would you expect this to have on fertilization?\na.\nThe pollen tube will be unable to form.\nb.\nThe pollen tube will form but will not be guided toward the egg.\nc.\nFertilization will not occur because the synergid is the egg.\nd.\nFertilization will occur but the embryo will not be able to grow.\nSexual Reproduction in Gymnosperms\nAs with angiosperms, the lifecycle of a gymnosperm is also characterized by alternation of generations. In conifers such as\npines, the green leafy part of the plant is the sporophyte, and the cones contain the male and female gametophytes (Figure 32.9).\nThe female cones are larger than the male cones and are positioned towards the top of the tree; the small, male cones are located\nin the lower region of the tree. Because the pollen is shed and blown by the wind, this arrangement makes it difficult for a\ngymnosperm to self-pollinate.\n896\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 32.9 This image shows the lifecycle of a conifer.

The bracts are known as microsporophylls\n(Figure 32.10) and are the sites where microspores will develop. The microspores develop inside the microsporangium. Within\nthe microsporangium, cells known as microsporocytes divide by meiosis to produce four haploid microspores. Further mitosis\nof the microspore produces two nuclei: the generative nucleus, and the tube nucleus. Upon maturity, the male gametophyte\n(pollen) is released from the male cones and is carried by the wind to land on the female cone.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video to see a cedar releasing its pollen in the wind.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/pollen_release)\nFemale Gametophyte\nThe female cone also has a central axis on which bracts known as megasporophylls (Figure 32.10) are present. In the female\ncone, megaspore mother cells are present in the megasporangium. The megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis to produce\nfour haploid megaspores. One of the megaspores divides to form the multicellular female gametophyte, while the others divide\nto form the rest of the structure. The female gametophyte is contained within a structure called the archegonium.\n32.1 \u2022 Reproductive Development and Structure\n897\nFigure 32.10 This series of micrographs shows male and female gymnosperm gametophytes.

(f) Within this single ovule are the\nmegaspore mother cell (MMC), micropyle, and a pollen grain. (credit: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt\nRussell)\nReproductive Process\nUpon landing on the female cone, the tube cell of the pollen forms the pollen tube, through which the generative cell migrates\ntowards the female gametophyte through the micropyle. It takes approximately one year for the pollen tube to grow and migrate\ntowards the female gametophyte. The male gametophyte containing the generative cell splits into two sperm nuclei, one of\nwhich fuses with the egg, while the other degenerates. After fertilization of the egg, the diploid zygote is formed, which divides\nby mitosis to form the embryo. The scales of the cones are closed during development of the seed. The seed is covered by a seed\ncoat, which is derived from the female sporophyte. Seed development takes another one to two years. Once the seed is ready to\nbe dispersed, the bracts of the female cones open to allow the dispersal of seed; no fruit formation takes place because\ngymnosperm seeds have no covering.\nAngiosperms versus Gymnosperms\nGymnosperm reproduction differs from that of angiosperms in several ways (Figure 32.11). In angiosperms, the female\ngametophyte exists in an enclosed structure\u2014the ovule\u2014which is within the ovary; in gymnosperms, the female gametophyte is\npresent on exposed bracts of the female cone. Double fertilization is a key event in the lifecycle of angiosperms, but is completely\nabsent in gymnosperms. The male and female gametophyte structures are present on separate male and female cones in\ngymnosperms, whereas in angiosperms, they are a part of the flower. Lastly, wind plays an important role in pollination in\n898\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ngymnosperms because pollen is blown by the wind to land on the female cones. Although many angiosperms are also wind-\npollinated, animal pollination is more common.\nFigure 32.11 (a) Angiosperms are flowering plants, and include grasses, herbs, shrubs and most deciduous trees, while (b) gymnosperms\nare conifers. Both produce seeds but have different reproductive strategies.

In gymnosperms, pollination involves pollen transfer from the male cone to the female cone. Upon transfer, the\npollen germinates to form the pollen tube and the sperm for fertilizing the egg. Pollination has been well studied since the time\nof Gregor Mendel. Mendel successfully carried out self- as well as cross-pollination in garden peas while studying how\ncharacteristics were passed on from one generation to the next. Today\u2019s crops are a result of plant breeding, which employs\nartificial selection to produce the present-day cultivars. A case in point is today's corn, which is a result of years of breeding that\nstarted with its ancestor, teosinte. The teosinte that the ancient Mayans originally began cultivating had tiny seeds\u2014vastly\ndifferent from today\u2019s relatively giant ears of corn. Interestingly, though these two plants appear to be entirely different, the\ngenetic difference between them is miniscule.\nPollination takes two forms: self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is\ndeposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from\nthe anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination occurs in\nflowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower\u2019s\nstigma. This method of pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for\npollinators.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nExplore this interactive website (http://openstax.org/l/pollination) to review self-pollination and cross-pollination.\n32.2 \u2022 Pollination and Fertilization\n899\nLiving species are designed to ensure survival of their progeny; those that fail become extinct. Genetic diversity is therefore\nrequired so that in changing environmental or stress conditions, some of the progeny can survive. Self-pollination leads to the\nproduction of plants with less genetic diversity, since genetic material from the same plant is used to form gametes, and\neventually, the zygote. In contrast, cross-pollination\u2014or out-crossing\u2014leads to greater genetic diversity because the\nmicrogametophyte and megagametophyte are derived from different plants.\nBecause cross-pollination allows for more genetic diversity, plants have developed many ways to avoid self-pollination. In some\nspecies, the pollen and the ovary mature at different times. These flowers make self-pollination nearly impossible. By the time\npollen matures and has been shed, the stigma of this flower is mature and can only be pollinated by pollen from another flower.\nSome flowers have developed physical features that prevent self-pollination. The primrose is one such flower. Primroses have\nevolved two flower types with differences in anther and stigma length: the pin-eyed flower has anthers positioned at the pollen\ntube\u2019s halfway point, and the thrum-eyed flower\u2019s stigma is likewise located at the halfway point. Insects easily cross-pollinate\nwhile seeking the nectar at the bottom of the pollen tube. This phenomenon is also known as heterostyly. Many plants, such as\ncucumber, have male and female flowers located on different parts of the plant, thus making self-pollination difficult. In yet\nother species, the male and female flowers are borne on different plants (dioecious). All of these are barriers to self-pollination;\ntherefore, the plants depend on pollinators to transfer pollen. The majority of pollinators are biotic agents such as insects (like\nbees, flies, and butterflies), bats, birds, and other animals. Other plant species are pollinated by abiotic agents, such as wind and\nwater.\nPollination by Insects\nBees are perhaps the most important pollinator of many garden plants and most commercial fruit trees (Figure 32.12). The most\ncommon species of bees are bumblebees and honeybees. Since bees cannot see the color red, bee-pollinated flowers usually have\nshades of blue, yellow, or other colors. Bees collect energy-rich pollen or nectar for their survival and energy needs. They visit\nflowers that are open during the day, are brightly colored, have a strong aroma or scent, and have a tubular shape, typically with\nthe presence of a nectar guide. A nectar guide includes regions on the flower petals that are visible only to bees, and not to\nhumans; it helps to guide bees to the center of the flower, thus making the pollination process more efficient. The pollen sticks to\nthe bees\u2019 fuzzy hair, and when the bee visits another flower, some of the pollen is transferred to the second flower. Recently,\nthere have been many reports about the declining population of honeybees. Many flowers will remain unpollinated and not bear\nseed if honeybees disappear. The impact on commercial fruit growers could be devastating.\nEveryday Connection\nIncompatibility Genes in Flowers\nIn recent decades, incompatibility genes\u2014which prevent pollen from germinating or growing into the stigma of a\nflower\u2014have been discovered in many angiosperm species. If plants do not have compatible genes, the pollen tube stops\ngrowing. Self-incompatibility is controlled by the S (sterility) locus. Pollen tubes have to grow through the tissue of the\nstigma and style before they can enter the ovule. The carpel is selective in the type of pollen it allows to grow inside. The\ninteraction is primarily between the pollen and the stigma epidermal cells. In some plants, like cabbage, the pollen is\nrejected at the surface of the stigma, and the unwanted pollen does not germinate. In other plants, pollen tube germination\nis arrested after growing one-third the length of the style, leading to pollen tube death. Pollen tube death is due either to\napoptosis (programmed cell death) or to degradation of pollen tube RNA. The degradation results from the activity of a\nribonuclease encoded by the S locus. The ribonuclease is secreted from the cells of the style in the extracellular matrix,\nwhich lies alongside the growing pollen tube.\nIn summary, self-incompatibility is a mechanism that prevents self-fertilization in many flowering plant species. The\nworking of this self-incompatibility mechanism has important consequences for plant breeders because it inhibits the\nproduction of inbred and hybrid plants.\n900\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 32.12 Insects, such as bees, are important agents of pollination. (credit: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)\nMany flies are attracted to flowers that have a decaying smell or an odor of rotting flesh. These flowers, which produce nectar,\nusually have dull colors, such as brown or purple. They are found on the corpse flower or voodoo lily (Amorphophallus), dragon\narum (Dracunculus), and carrion flower (Stapleia, Rafflesia). The nectar provides energy, whereas the pollen provides protein.\nWasps are also important insect pollinators, and pollinate many species of figs.\nButterflies, such as the monarch, pollinate many garden flowers and wildflowers, which usually occur in clusters. These flowers\nare brightly colored, have a strong fragrance, are open during the day, and have nectar guides to make access to nectar easier.\nThe pollen is picked up and carried on the butterfly\u2019s limbs. Moths, on the other hand, pollinate flowers during the late\nafternoon and night. The flowers pollinated by moths are pale or white and are flat, enabling the moths to land. One well-\nstudied example of a moth-pollinated plant is the yucca plant, which is pollinated by the yucca moth. The shape of the flower\nand moth have adapted in such a way as to allow successful pollination. The moth deposits pollen on the sticky stigma for\nfertilization to occur later. The female moth also deposits eggs into the ovary. As the eggs develop into larvae, they obtain food\nfrom the flower and developing seeds. Thus, both the insect and flower benefit from each other in this symbiotic relationship.\nThe corn earworm moth and Gaura plant have a similar relationship (Figure 32.13).\nFigure 32.13 A corn earworm sips nectar from a night-blooming Gaura plant. (credit: Juan Lopez, USDA ARS)\nPollination by Bats\nIn the tropics and deserts, bats are often the pollinators of nocturnal flowers such as agave, guava, and morning glory. The\nflowers are usually large and white or pale-colored; thus, they can be distinguished from the dark surroundings at night. The\nflowers have a strong, fruity, or musky fragrance and produce large amounts of nectar. They are naturally large and wide-\nmouthed to accommodate the head of the bat. As the bats seek the nectar, their faces and heads become covered with pollen,\nwhich is then transferred to the next flower.\n32.2 \u2022 Pollination and Fertilization\n901\nPollination by Birds\nMany species of small birds, such as the hummingbird (Figure 32.14) and sun birds, are pollinators for plants such as orchids and\nother wildflowers. Flowers visited by birds are usually sturdy and are oriented in such a way as to allow the birds to stay near the\nflower without getting their wings entangled in the nearby flowers. The flower typically has a curved, tubular shape, which\nallows access for the bird\u2019s beak. Brightly colored, odorless flowers that are open during the day are pollinated by birds. As a bird\nseeks energy-rich nectar, pollen is deposited on the bird\u2019s head and neck and is then transferred to the next flower it visits.\nBotanists have been known to determine the range of extinct plants by collecting and identifying pollen from 200-year-old bird\nspecimens from the same site.\nFigure 32.14 Hummingbirds have adaptations that allow them to reach the nectar of certain tubular flowers. (credit: Lori Branham)\nPollination by Wind\nMost species of conifers, and many angiosperms, such as grasses, maples and oaks, are pollinated by wind. Pine cones are\nbrown and unscented, while the flowers of wind-pollinated angiosperm species are usually green, small, may have small or no\npetals, and produce large amounts of pollen. Unlike the typical insect-pollinated flowers, flowers adapted to pollination by wind\ndo not produce nectar or scent. In wind-pollinated species, the microsporangia hang out of the flower, and, as the wind blows,\nthe lightweight pollen is carried with it (Figure 32.15). The flowers usually emerge early in the spring, before the leaves, so that\nthe leaves do not block the movement of the wind. The pollen is deposited on the exposed feathery stigma of the flower (Figure\n32.16).\n902\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 32.15 A person knocks pollen from a pine tree.\nFigure 32.16 These male (a) and female (b) catkins are from the goat willow tree (Salix caprea). Note how both structures are light and\nfeathery to better disperse and catch the wind-blown pollen.\nPollination by Water\nSome weeds, such as Australian sea grass and pond weeds, are pollinated by water. The pollen floats on water, and when it\ncomes into contact with the flower, it is deposited inside the flower.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nPollination by Deception\nOrchids are highly valued flowers, with many rare varieties (Figure 32.17). They grow in a range of specific habitats, mainly in the\ntropics of Asia, South America, and Central America. At least 25,000 species of orchids have been identified.\n32.2 \u2022 Pollination and Fertilization\n903\nFigure 32.17 Certain orchids use food deception or sexual deception to attract pollinators. Shown here is a bee orchid (Ophrys apifera).\n(credit: David Evans)\nFlowers often attract pollinators with food rewards, in the form of nectar. However, some species of orchid are an exception to\nthis standard: they have evolved different ways to attract the desired pollinators. They use a method known as food deception, in\nwhich bright colors and perfumes are offered, but no food. Anacamptis morio, commonly known as the green-winged orchid,\nbears bright purple flowers and emits a strong scent. The bumblebee, its main pollinator, is attracted to the flower because of the\nstrong scent\u2014which usually indicates food for a bee\u2014and in the process, picks up the pollen to be transported to another\nflower.\nOther orchids use sexual deception. Chiloglottis trapeziformis emits a compound that smells the same as the pheromone\nemitted by a female wasp to attract male wasps. The male wasp is attracted to the scent, lands on the orchid flower, and in the\nprocess, transfers pollen. Some orchids, like the Australian hammer orchid, use scent as well as visual trickery in yet another\nsexual deception strategy to attract wasps. The flower of this orchid mimics the appearance of a female wasp and emits a\npheromone. The male wasp tries to mate with what appears to be a female wasp, and in the process, picks up pollen, which it\nthen transfers to the next counterfeit mate.\nDouble Fertilization\nAfter pollen is deposited on the stigma, it must germinate and grow through the style to reach the ovule. The microspores, or the\npollen, contain two cells: the pollen tube cell and the generative cell. The pollen tube cell grows into a pollen tube through which\nthe generative cell travels. The germination of the pollen tube requires water, oxygen, and certain chemical signals. As it travels\nthrough the style to reach the embryo sac, the pollen tube\u2019s growth is supported by the tissues of the style. In the meantime, if\nthe generative cell has not already split into two cells, it now divides to form two sperm cells. The pollen tube is guided by the\nchemicals secreted by the synergids present in the embryo sac, and it enters the ovule sac through the micropyle. Of the two\nsperm cells, one sperm fertilizes the egg cell, forming a diploid zygote; the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei, forming\na triploid cell that develops into the endosperm. Together, these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double\nfertilization (Figure 32.18). After fertilization is complete, no other sperm can enter. The fertilized ovule forms the seed, whereas\nthe tissues of the ovary become the fruit, usually enveloping the seed.\n904\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 32.18 In angiosperms, one sperm fertilizes the egg to form the 2n zygote, and the other sperm fertilizes the central cell to form the\n3n endosperm. This is called a double fertilization.\nAfter fertilization, the zygote divides to form two cells: the upper cell, or terminal cell, and the lower, or basal, cell. The division\nof the basal cell gives rise to the suspensor, which eventually makes connection with the maternal tissue. The suspensor\nprovides a route for nutrition to be transported from the mother plant to the growing embryo. The terminal cell also divides,\ngiving rise to a globular-shaped proembryo (Figure 32.19a). In dicots (eudicots), the developing embryo has a heart shape, due to\nthe presence of the two rudimentary cotyledons (Figure 32.19b). In non-endospermic dicots, such as Capsella bursa, the\nendosperm develops initially, but is then digested, and the food reserves are moved into the two cotyledons. As the embryo and\ncotyledons enlarge, they run out of room inside the developing seed, and are forced to bend (Figure 32.19c). Ultimately, the\nembryo and cotyledons fill the seed (Figure 32.19d), and the seed is ready for dispersal. Embryonic development is suspended\nafter some time, and growth is resumed only when the seed germinates. The developing seedling will rely on the food reserves\nstored in the cotyledons until the first set of leaves begin photosynthesis.\n32.2 \u2022 Pollination and Fertilization\n905\nFigure 32.19 Shown are the stages of embryo development in the ovule of a shepherd\u2019s purse (Capsella bursa). After fertilization, the\nzygote divides to form an upper terminal cell and a lower basal cell. (a) In the first stage of development, the terminal cell divides, forming a\nglobular pro-embryo. The basal cell also divides, giving rise to the suspensor. (b) In the second stage, the developing embryo has a heart\nshape due to the presence of cotyledons. (c) In the third stage, the growing embryo runs out of room and starts to bend. (d) Eventually, it\ncompletely fills the seed. (credit: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nDevelopment of the Seed\nThe mature ovule develops into the seed. A typical seed contains a seed coat, cotyledons, endosperm, and a single embryo\n(Figure 32.20).\n906\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 32.20 The structures of dicot and monocot seeds are shown. Dicots (left) have two cotyledons. Monocots, such as corn (right), have\none cotyledon, called the scutellum; it channels nutrition to the growing embryo. Both monocot and dicot embryos have a plumule that\nforms the leaves, a hypocotyl that forms the stem, and a radicle that forms the root. The embryonic axis comprises everything between the\nplumule and the radicle, not including the cotyledon(s).\nWhat of the following statements is true?\na.\nBoth monocots and dicots have an endosperm.\nb.\nThe radicle develops into the root.\nc.\nThe plumule is part of the epicotyl.\nd.\nThe endosperm is part of the embryo.\nThe storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots. In monocots, such as corn and wheat,\nthe single cotyledon is called a scutellum; the scutellum is connected directly to the embryo via vascular tissue (xylem and\nphloem). Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm. Upon germination, enzymes are secreted by the aleurone, a single\nlayer of cells just inside the seed coat that surrounds the endosperm and embryo. The enzymes degrade the stored\ncarbohydrates, proteins and lipids, the products of which are absorbed by the scutellum and transported via a vasculature\nstrand to the developing embryo. Therefore, the scutellum can be seen to be an absorptive organ, not a storage organ.\nThe two cotyledons in the dicot seed also have vascular connections to the embryo. In endospermic dicots, the food reserves are\nstored in the endosperm. During germination, the two cotyledons therefore act as absorptive organs to take up the\nenzymatically released food reserves, much like in monocots (monocots, by definition, also have endospermic seeds). Tobacco\n(Nicotiana tabaccum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and pepper (Capsicum annuum) are examples of endospermic dicots. In\nnon-endospermic dicots, the triploid endosperm develops normally following double fertilization, but the endosperm food\nreserves are quickly remobilized and moved into the developing cotyledon for storage. The two halves of a peanut seed (Arachis\nhypogaea) and the split peas (Pisum sativum) of split pea soup are individual cotyledons loaded with food reserves.\nThe seed, along with the ovule, is protected by a seed coat that is formed from the integuments of the ovule sac. In dicots, the\nseed coat is further divided into an outer coat known as the testa and inner coat known as the tegmen.\nThe embryonic axis consists of three parts: the plumule, the radicle, and the hypocotyl. The portion of the embryo between the\ncotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl (hypocotyl means \u201cbelow the cotyledons\u201d). The embryonic\naxis terminates in a radicle (the embryonic root), which is the region from which the root will develop. In dicots, the hypocotyls\nextend above ground, giving rise to the stem of the plant. In monocots, the hypocotyl does not show above ground because\nmonocots do not exhibit stem elongation. The part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the\nepicotyl. The plumule is composed of the epicotyl, young leaves, and the shoot apical meristem.\nUpon germination in dicot seeds, the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards. This shape is called\nthe plumule hook, and it persists as long as germination proceeds in the dark. Therefore, as the epicotyl pushes through the\ntough and abrasive soil, the plumule is protected from damage. Upon exposure to light, the hypocotyl hook straightens out, the\nyoung foliage leaves face the sun and expand, and the epicotyl continues to elongate. During this time, the radicle is also\n32.2 \u2022 Pollination and Fertilization\n907\ngrowing and producing the primary root. As it grows downward to form the tap root, lateral roots branch off to all sides,\nproducing the typical dicot tap root system.\nIn monocot seeds (Figure 32.21), the testa and tegmen of the seed coat are fused. As the seed germinates, the primary root\nemerges, protected by the root-tip covering: the coleorhiza. Next, the primary shoot emerges, protected by the coleoptile: the\ncovering of the shoot tip. Upon exposure to light (i.e., when the plumule has exited the soil and the protective coleoptile is no\nlonger needed), elongation of the coleoptile ceases and the leaves expand and unfold. At the other end of the embryonic axis, the\nprimary root soon dies, while other, adventitious roots (roots that do not arise from the usual place \u2013 i.e., the root) emerge from\nthe base of the stem. This gives the monocot a fibrous root system.\nFigure 32.21 As this monocot grass seed germinates, the primary root, or radicle, emerges first, followed by the primary shoot, or\ncoleoptile, and the adventitious roots.\nSeed Germination\nMany mature seeds enter a period of inactivity, or extremely low metabolic activity: a process known as dormancy, which may\nlast for months, years, or even centuries. Dormancy helps keep seeds viable during unfavorable conditions. Upon a return to\nfavorable conditions, seed germination takes place. Favorable conditions could be as diverse as moisture, light, cold, fire, or\nchemical treatments. After heavy rains, many new seedlings emerge. Forest fires also lead to the emergence of new seedlings.\nSome seeds require vernalization (cold treatment) before they can germinate. This guarantees that seeds produced by plants in\ntemperate climates will not germinate until the spring. Plants growing in hot climates may have seeds that need a heat\ntreatment in order to germinate, to avoid germination in the hot, dry summers. In many seeds, the presence of a thick seed coat\nretards the ability to germinate. Scarification, which includes mechanical or chemical processes to soften the seed coat, is often\nemployed before germination. Presoaking in hot water, or passing through an acid environment, such as an animal\u2019s digestive\ntract, may also be employed.\nDepending on seed size, the time taken for a seedling to emerge may vary. Species with large seeds have enough food reserves to\ngerminate deep below ground, and still extend their epicotyl all the way to the soil surface. Seeds of small-seeded species usually\nrequire light as a germination cue. This ensures the seeds only germinate at or near the soil surface (where the light is greatest).\nIf they were to germinate too far underneath the surface, the developing seedling would not have enough food reserves to reach\nthe sunlight.\nDevelopment of Fruit and Fruit Types\nAfter fertilization, the ovary of the flower usually develops into the fruit. Fruits are usually associated with having a sweet taste;\nhowever, not all fruits are sweet. Botanically, the term \u201cfruit\u201d is used for a ripened ovary. In most cases, flowers in which\nfertilization has taken place will develop into fruits, and flowers in which fertilization has not taken place will not. Some fruits\ndevelop from the ovary and are known as true fruits, whereas others develop from other parts of the female gametophyte and\nare known as accessory fruits. The fruit encloses the seeds and the developing embryo, thereby providing it with protection.\nFruits are of many types, depending on their origin and texture. The sweet tissue of the blackberry, the red flesh of the tomato,\n908\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthe shell of the peanut, and the hull of corn (the tough, thin part that gets stuck in your teeth when you eat popcorn) are all\nfruits. As the fruit matures, the seeds also mature.\nFruits may be classified as simple, aggregate, multiple, or accessory, depending on their origin (Figure 32.22). If the fruit\ndevelops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary, it is known as a simple fruit, as seen in nuts and beans. An\naggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel, but all are in the same flower: the mature carpels fuse together\nto form the entire fruit, as seen in the raspberry. Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers. An\nexample is the pineapple, where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit. Accessory fruits (sometimes called false fruits) are\nnot derived from the ovary, but from another part of the flower, such as the receptacle (strawberry) or the hypanthium (apples\nand pears).\nFigure 32.22 There are four main types of fruits. Simple fruits, such as these nuts, are derived from a single ovary. Aggregate fruits, like\nraspberries, form from many carpels that fuse together. Multiple fruits, such as pineapple, form from a cluster of flowers called an\ninflorescence. Accessory fruit, like the apple, are formed from a part of the plant other than the ovary. (credit \"nuts\": modification of work\nby Petr Kratochvil; credit \"raspberries\": modification of work by Cory Zanker; credit \"pineapple\": modification of work by Howie Le; credit\n\"apple\": modification of work by Paolo Neo)\nFruits generally have three parts: the exocarp (the outermost skin or covering), the mesocarp (middle part of the fruit), and the\nendocarp (the inner part of the fruit). Together, all three are known as the pericarp. The mesocarp is usually the fleshy, edible\npart of the fruit; however, in some fruits, such as the almond, the endocarp is the edible part. In many fruits, two or all three of\nthe layers are fused, and are indistinguishable at maturity. Fruits can be dry or fleshy. Furthermore, fruits can be divided into\ndehiscent or indehiscent types. Dehiscent fruits, such as peas, readily release their seeds, while indehiscent fruits, like peaches,\nrely on decay to release their seeds.\nFruit and Seed Dispersal\nThe fruit has a single purpose: seed dispersal. Seeds contained within fruits need to be dispersed far from the mother plant, so\n32.2 \u2022 Pollination and Fertilization\n909\nthey may find favorable and less competitive conditions in which to germinate and grow.\nSome fruit have built-in mechanisms so they can disperse by themselves, whereas others require the help of agents like wind,\nwater, and animals (Figure 32.23). Modifications in seed structure, composition, and size help in dispersal. Wind-dispersed\nfruit are lightweight and may have wing-like appendages that allow them to be carried by the wind. Some have a parachute-like\nstructure to keep them afloat. Some fruits\u2014for example, the dandelion\u2014have hairy, weightless structures that are suited to\ndispersal by wind.\nSeeds dispersed by water are contained in light and buoyant fruit, giving them the ability to float. Coconuts are well known for\ntheir ability to float on water to reach land where they can germinate. Similarly, willow and silver birches produce lightweight\nfruit that can float on water.\nAnimals and birds eat fruits, and the seeds that are not digested are excreted in their droppings some distance away. Some\nanimals, like squirrels, bury seed-containing fruits for later use; if the squirrel does not find its stash of fruit, and if conditions\nare favorable, the seeds germinate. Some fruits, like the cocklebur, have hooks or sticky structures that stick to an animal's coat\nand are then transported to another place. Humans also play a big role in dispersing seeds when they carry fruits to new places\nand throw away the inedible part that contains the seeds.\nAll of the above mechanisms allow for seeds to be dispersed through space, much like an animal\u2019s offspring can move to a new\nlocation. Seed dormancy, which was described earlier, allows plants to disperse their progeny through time: something animals\ncannot do. Dormant seeds can wait months, years, or even decades for the proper conditions for germination and propagation\nof the species.\nFigure 32.23 Fruits and seeds are dispersed by various means. (a) Dandelion seeds are dispersed by wind, the (b) coconut seed is\ndispersed by water, and the (c) acorn is dispersed by animals that cache and then forget it.

This method does not require the investment\nrequired to produce a flower, attract pollinators, or find a means of seed dispersal. Asexual reproduction produces plants that\nare genetically identical to the parent plant because no mixing of male and female gametes takes place. Traditionally, these\nplants survive well under stable environmental conditions when compared with plants produced from sexual reproduction\nbecause they carry genes identical to those of their parents.\nMany different types of roots exhibit asexual reproduction (Figure 32.24). The corm is used by gladiolus and garlic. Bulbs, such\nas a scaly bulb in lilies and a tunicate bulb in daffodils, are other common examples. A potato is a stem tuber, while parsnip\npropagates from a taproot. Ginger and iris produce rhizomes, while ivy uses an adventitious root (a root arising from a plant\npart other than the main or primary root), and the strawberry plant has a stolon, which is also called a runner.\n910\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 32.24 Different types of stems allow for asexual reproduction. (a) The corm of a garlic plant looks similar to (b) a tulip bulb, but the\ncorm is solid tissue, while the bulb consists of layers of modified leaves that surround an underground stem. Both corms and bulbs can self-\npropagate, giving rise to new plants. (c) Ginger forms masses of stems called rhizomes that can give rise to multiple plants. (d) Potato\nplants form fleshy stem tubers. Each eye in the stem tuber can give rise to a new plant. (e) Strawberry plants form stolons: stems that grow\nat the soil surface or just below ground and can give rise to new plants. (credit a: modification of work by Dwight Sipler; credit c:\nmodification of work by Albert Cahalan, USDA ARS; credit d: modification of work by Richard North; credit e: modification of work by Julie\nMagro)\nSome plants can produce seeds without fertilization. Either the ovule or part of the ovary, which is diploid in nature, gives rise\nto a new seed. This method of reproduction is known as apomixis.\n32.3 \u2022 Asexual Reproduction\n911\nAn advantage of asexual reproduction is that the resulting plant will reach maturity faster. Since the new plant is arising from an\nadult plant or plant parts, it will also be sturdier than a seedling. Asexual reproduction can take place by natural or artificial\n(assisted by humans) means.\nNatural Methods of Asexual Reproduction\nNatural methods of asexual reproduction include strategies that plants have developed to self-propagate. Many plants\u2014like\nginger, onion, gladioli, and dahlia\u2014continue to grow from buds that are present on the surface of the stem. In some plants,\nsuch as the sweet potato, adventitious roots or runners can give rise to new plants (Figure 32.25). In Bryophyllum and kalanchoe,\nthe leaves have small buds on their margins. When these are detached from the plant, they grow into independent plants; or,\nthey may start growing into independent plants if the leaf touches the soil. Some plants can be propagated through cuttings\nalone.\nFigure 32.25 A stolon, or runner, is a stem that runs along the ground. At the nodes, it forms adventitious roots and buds that grow into a\nnew plant.\nArtificial Methods of Asexual Reproduction\nThese methods are frequently employed to give rise to new, and sometimes novel, plants. They include grafting, cutting,\nlayering, and micropropagation.\nGrafting\nGrafting has long been used to produce novel varieties of roses, citrus species, and other plants. In grafting, two plant species\nare used; part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock. The part that is grafted or\nattached is called the scion. Both are cut at an oblique angle (any angle other than a right angle), placed in close contact with\neach other, and are then held together (Figure 32.26). Matching up these two surfaces as closely as possible is extremely\nimportant because these will be holding the plant together. The vascular systems of the two plants grow and fuse, forming a\ngraft. After a period of time, the scion starts producing shoots, and eventually starts bearing flowers and fruits. Grafting is\nwidely used in viticulture (grape growing) and the citrus industry. Scions capable of producing a particular fruit variety are\ngrafted onto root stock with specific resistance to disease.\n912\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 32.26 Grafting is an artificial method of asexual reproduction used to produce plants combining favorable stem characteristics with\nfavorable root characteristics. The stem of the plant to be grafted is known as the scion, and the root is called the stock.\nCutting\nPlants such as coleus and money plant are propagated through stem cuttings, where a portion of the stem containing nodes and\ninternodes is placed in moist soil and allowed to root. In some species, stems can start producing a root even when placed only\nin water. For example, leaves of the African violet will root if kept in water undisturbed for several weeks.\nLayering\nLayering is a method in which a stem attached to the plant is bent and covered with soil. Young stems that can be bent easily\nwithout any injury are preferred. Jasmine and bougainvillea (paper flower) can be propagated this way (Figure 32.27). In some\nplants, a modified form of layering known as air layering is employed. A portion of the bark or outermost covering of the stem is\nremoved and covered with moss, which is then taped. Some gardeners also apply rooting hormone. After some time, roots will\nappear, and this portion of the plant can be removed and transplanted into a separate pot.\nFigure 32.27 In layering, a part of the stem is buried so that it forms a new plant.

This method allows propagation of rare, endangered species that may be\ndifficult to grow under natural conditions, are economically important, or are in demand as disease-free plants.\nFigure 32.28 Micropropagation is used to propagate plants in sterile conditions. (credit: Nikhilesh Sanyal)\nTo start plant tissue culture, a part of the plant such as a stem, leaf, embryo, anther, or seed can be used. The plant material is\nthoroughly sterilized using a combination of chemical treatments standardized for that species. Under sterile conditions, the\nplant material is placed on a plant tissue culture medium that contains all the minerals, vitamins, and hormones required by the\nplant. The plant part often gives rise to an undifferentiated mass known as callus, from which individual plantlets begin to grow\nafter a period of time. These can be separated and are first grown under greenhouse conditions before they are moved to field\nconditions.\nPlant Life Spans\nThe length of time from the beginning of development to the death of a plant is called its life span. The life cycle, on the other\nhand, is the sequence of stages a plant goes through from seed germination to seed production of the mature plant. Some\nplants, such as annuals, only need a few weeks to grow, produce seeds and die. Other plants, such as the bristlecone pine, live for\nthousands of years. Some bristlecone pines have a documented age of 4,500 years (Figure 32.29). Even as some parts of a plant,\nsuch as regions containing meristematic tissue\u2014the area of active plant growth consisting of undifferentiated cells capable of\ncell division\u2014continue to grow, some parts undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). The cork found on stems, and the\nwater-conducting tissue of the xylem, for example, are composed of dead cells.\n914\nChapter 32 \u2022 Plant Reproduction\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 32.29 The bristlecone pine, shown here in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest in the White Mountains of eastern California, has been\nknown to live for 4,500 years. (credit: Rick Goldwaser)\nPlant species that complete their lifecycle in one season are known as annuals, an example of which is Arabidopsis, or mouse-ear\ncress. Biennials such as carrots complete their lifecycle in two seasons. In a biennial\u2019s first season, the plant has a vegetative\nphase, whereas in the next season, it completes its reproductive phase. Commercial growers harvest the carrot roots after the\nfirst year of growth, and do not allow the plants to flower. Perennials, such as the magnolia, complete their lifecycle in two years\nor more.\nIn another classification based on flowering frequency, monocarpic plants flower only once in their lifetime; examples include\nbamboo and yucca. During the vegetative period of their life cycle (which may be as long as 120 years in some bamboo species),\nthese plants may reproduce asexually and accumulate a great deal of food material that will be required during their once-in-a-\nlifetime flowering and setting of seed after fertilization. Soon after flowering, these plants die. Polycarpic plants form flowers\nmany times during their lifetime. Fruit trees, such as apple and orange trees, are polycarpic; they flower every year. Other\npolycarpic species, such as perennials, flower several times during their life span, but not each year. By this means, the plant\ndoes not require all its nutrients to be channelled towards flowering each year.\nAs is the case with all living organisms, genetics and environmental conditions have a role to play in determining how long a\nplant will live. Susceptibility to disease, changing environmental conditions, drought, cold, and competition for nutrients are\nsome of the factors that determine the survival of a plant. Plants continue to grow, despite the presence of dead tissue such as\ncork. Individual parts of plants, such as flowers and leaves, have different rates of survival. In many trees, the older leaves turn\nyellow and eventually fall from the tree. Leaf fall is triggered by factors such as a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency, due to\nshading by upper leaves, or oxidative damage incurred as a result of photosynthetic reactions. The components of the part to be\nshed are recycled by the plant for use in other processes, such as development of seed and storage. This process is known as\nnutrient recycling.\nThe aging of a plant and all the associated processes is known as senescence, which is marked by several complex biochemical\nchanges. One of the characteristics of senescence is the breakdown of chloroplasts, which is characterized by the yellowing of\nleaves. The chloroplasts contain components of photosynthetic machinery such as membranes and proteins. Chloroplasts also\ncontain DNA. The proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids are broken down by specific enzymes into smaller molecules and salvaged\nby the plant to support the growth of other plant tissues.\nThe complex pathways of nutrient recycling within a plant are not well understood. Hormones are known to play a role in\nsenescence. Applications of cytokinins and ethylene delay or prevent senescence; in contrast, abscissic acid causes premature\nonset of senescence.\n32.3 \u2022 Asexual Reproduction\n915\n", "key_terms": "\naccessory fruit\nfruit derived from tissues other than the\novary\naggregate fruit\nfruit that develops from multiple carpels in\nthe same flower\naleurone\nsingle layer of cells just inside the seed coat that\nsecretes enzymes upon germination\nandroecium\nsum of all the stamens in a flower\nantipodals\nthe three cells away from the micropyle\napomixis\nprocess by which seeds are produced without\nfertilization of sperm and egg\ncoleoptile\ncovering of the shoot tip, found in germinating\nmonocot seeds\ncoleorhiza\ncovering of the root tip, found in germinating\nmonocot seeds\ncotyledon\nfleshy part of seed that provides nutrition to the\nseed\ncross-pollination\ntransfer of pollen from the anther of one\nflower to the stigma of a different flower\ncutting\nmethod of asexual reproduction where a portion of\nthe stem contains nodes and internodes is placed in\nmoist soil and allowed to root\ndormancy\nperiod of no growth and very slow metabolic\nprocesses\ndouble fertilization\ntwo fertilization events in\nangiosperms;

All\ncomplete flowers contain four whorls: the calyx, corolla,\nandroecium, and gynoecium. The stamens are made up of\nanthers, in which pollen grains are produced, and a\nsupportive strand called the filament. The pollen contains\ntwo cells\u2014 a generative cell and a tube cell\u2014and is covered\nby two layers called the intine and the exine. The carpels,\nwhich are the female reproductive structures, consist of the\nstigma, style, and ovary. The female gametophyte is formed\nfrom mitotic divisions of the megaspore, forming an eight-\nnuclei ovule sac. This is covered by a layer known as the\nintegument. The integument contains an opening called the\nmicropyle, through which the pollen tube enters the embryo\nsac.\nThe diploid sporophyte of angiosperms and gymnosperms is\nthe conspicuous and long-lived stage of the life cycle. The\nsporophytes differentiate specialized reproductive structures\ncalled sporangia, which are dedicated to the production of\nspores. The microsporangium contains microspore mother\ncells, which divide by meiosis to produce haploid\nmicrospores. The microspores develop into male\ngametophytes that are released as pollen. The\nmegasporangium contains megaspore mother cells, which\ndivide by meiosis to produce haploid megaspores. A\nmegaspore develops into a female gametophyte containing a\nhaploid egg. A new diploid sporophyte is formed when a\nmale gamete from a pollen grain enters the ovule sac and\nfertilizes this egg.\n32.2 Pollination and Fertilization\nFor fertilization to occur in angiosperms, pollen has to be\ntransferred to the stigma of a flower: a process known as\npollination. Gymnosperm pollination involves the transfer of\npollen from a male cone to a female cone. When the pollen of\nthe flower is transferred to the stigma of the same or another\nflower on the same plant, it is called self-pollination. Cross-\npollination occurs when pollen is transferred from one\nflower to another flower of another plant. Cross-pollination\nrequires pollinating agents such as water, wind, or animals,\nand increases genetic diversity. After the pollen lands on the\nstigma, the tube cell gives rise to the pollen tube, through\nwhich the generative nucleus migrates. The pollen tube gains\nentry through the micropyle on the ovule sac. The generative\ncell divides to form two sperm cells: one fuses with the egg to\nform the diploid zygote, and the other fuses with the polar\nnuclei to form the endosperm, which is triploid in nature.\nThis is known as double fertilization. After fertilization, the\nzygote divides to form the embryo and the fertilized ovule\nforms the seed. The walls of the ovary form the fruit in which\nthe seeds develop. The seed, when mature, will germinate\nunder favorable conditions and give rise to the diploid\nsporophyte.\n32.3 Asexual Reproduction\nMany plants reproduce asexually as well as sexually. In\nasexual reproduction, part of the parent plant is used to\ngenerate a new plant. Grafting, layering, and\nmicropropagation are some methods used for artificial\nasexual reproduction. The new plant is genetically identical\nto the parent plant from which the stock has been taken.\nAsexually reproducing plants thrive well in stable\nenvironments.\nPlants have different life spans, dependent on species,\ngenotype, and environmental conditions. Parts of the plant,\nsuch as regions containing meristematic tissue, continue to\ngrow, while other parts experience programmed cell death.\nLeaves that are no longer photosynthetically active are shed\nfrom the plant as part of senescence, and the nutrients from\nthese leaves are recycled by the plant. Other factors,\nincluding the presence of hormones, are known to play a role\nin delaying senescence.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

From a sponge to a worm to a goat, an organism has a distinct body plan\nthat limits its size and shape. Animals\u2019 bodies are also designed to interact with their environments, whether\nin the deep sea, a rainforest canopy, or the desert. Therefore, a large amount of information about the\nstructure of an organism's body (anatomy) and the function of its cells, tissues and organs (physiology) can\nbe learned by studying that organism's environment.\nFigure 33.1 An arctic fox is a complex animal, well adapted to its environment. It changes coat\ncolor with the seasons, and has longer fur in winter to trap heat. (credit: modification of work by\nKeith Morehouse, USFWS)\nINTRODUCTION The arctic fox is an example of a complex animal that has adapted to its environment\nand illustrates the relationships between an animal\u2019s form and function. The structures of animals\nconsist of primary tissues that make up more complex organs and organ systems. Homeostasis allows an\nanimal to maintain a balance between its internal and external environments.\nChapter Outline\n33.1 Animal Form and\nFunction\n33.2 Animal Primary\nTissues\n33.3 Homeostasis\nBody Plans\nFigure 33.2 Animals exhibit different types of body symmetry. The sponge is asymmetrical, the sea anemone has\nradial symmetry, and the goat has bilateral symmetry.\nAnimal body plans follow set patterns related to symmetry. They are asymmetrical, radial, or bilateral in\nform as illustrated in Figure 33.2. Asymmetrical animals are animals with no pattern or symmetry; an\nexample of an asymmetrical animal is a sponge. Radial symmetry, as illustrated in Figure 33.2, describes\nwhen an animal has an up-and-down orientation: any plane cut along its longitudinal axis through the\norganism produces equal halves, but not a definite right or left side. This plan is found mostly in aquatic\nanimals, especially organisms that attach themselves to a base, like a rock or a boat, and extract their food\nfrom the surrounding water as it flows around the organism. Bilateral symmetry is illustrated in the same\nfigure by a goat. The goat also has an upper and lower component to it, but a plane cut from front to back\nseparates the animal into definite right and left sides. Additional terms used when describing positions in\nthe body are anterior (front), posterior (rear), dorsal (toward the back), and ventral (toward the stomach).\nBilateral symmetry is found in both land-based and aquatic animals; it enables a high level of mobility.\nLimits on Animal Size and Shape\nAnimals with bilateral symmetry that live in water tend to have a fusiform shape: this is a tubular shaped\nbody that is tapered at both ends. This shape decreases the drag on the body as it moves through water and\nallows the animal to swim at high speeds. Table 33.1 lists the maximum speed of various animals. Certain\ntypes of sharks can swim at fifty kilometers per hour and some dolphins at 32 to 40 kilometers per hour.\nLand animals frequently travel faster, although the tortoise and snail are significantly slower than cheetahs.\nAnother difference in the adaptations of aquatic and land-dwelling organisms is that aquatic organisms are\nconstrained in shape by the forces of drag in the water since water has higher viscosity than air. On the other\nhand, land-dwelling organisms are constrained mainly by gravity, and drag is relatively unimportant. For\nexample, most adaptations in birds are for gravity not for drag.\nMaximum Speed of Assorted Land & Marine Animals\nAnimal\nSpeed (kmh)\nSpeed (mph)\nCheetah\n113\n70\nQuarter horse\n77\n48\nFox\n68\n42\nTable 33.1\n922\nChapter 33 \u2022 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nAnimal\nSpeed (kmh)\nSpeed (mph)\nShortfin mako shark\n50\n31\nDomestic house cat\n48\n30\nHuman\n45\n28\nDolphin\n32\u201340\n20\u201325\nMouse\n13\n8\nSnail\n0.05\n0.03\nTable 33.1\nMost animals have an exoskeleton, including insects, spiders, scorpions, horseshoe crabs, centipedes, and crustaceans.\nScientists estimate that, of insects alone, there are over 30 million species on our planet. The exoskeleton is a hard covering or\nshell that provides benefits to the animal, such as protection against damage from predators and from water loss (for land\nanimals); it also provides for the attachments of muscles.\nAs the tough and resistant outer cover of an arthropod, the exoskeleton may be constructed of a tough polymer such as chitin\nand is often biomineralized with materials such as calcium carbonate. This is fused to the animal\u2019s epidermis. Ingrowths of the\nexoskeleton, called apodemes, function as attachment sites for muscles, similar to tendons in more advanced animals (Figure\n33.3). In order to grow, the animal must first synthesize a new exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed or molt the\noriginal covering. This limits the animal\u2019s ability to grow continually, and may limit the individual\u2019s ability to mature if molting\ndoes not occur at the proper time. The thickness of the exoskeleton must be increased significantly to accommodate any increase\nin weight. It is estimated that a doubling of body size increases body weight by a factor of eight. The increasing thickness of the\nchitin necessary to support this weight limits most animals with an exoskeleton to a relatively small size. The same principles\napply to endoskeletons, but they are more efficient because muscles are attached on the outside, making it easier to compensate\nfor increased mass.\nFigure 33.3 Apodemes are ingrowths on arthropod exoskeletons to which muscles attach. The apodemes on this crab leg are located above\nand below the fulcrum of the claw. Contraction of muscles attached to the apodemes pulls the claw closed.\nAn animal with an endoskeleton has its size determined by the amount of skeletal system it needs in order to support the other\ntissues and the amount of muscle it needs for movement. As the body size increases, both bone and muscle mass increase. The\nspeed achievable by the animal is a balance between its overall size and the bone and muscle that provide support and\nmovement.\nLimiting Effects of Diffusion on Size and Development\nThe exchange of nutrients and wastes between a cell and its watery environment occurs through the process of diffusion. All\nliving cells are bathed in liquid, whether they are in a single-celled organism or a multicellular one. Diffusion is effective over a\nspecific distance and limits the size that an individual cell can attain. If a cell is a single-celled microorganism, such as an\n33.1 \u2022 Animal Form and Function\n923\namoeba, it can satisfy all of its nutrient and waste needs through diffusion. If the cell is too large, then diffusion is ineffective\nand the center of the cell does not receive adequate nutrients nor is it able to effectively dispel its waste.\nAn important concept in understanding how efficient diffusion is as a means of transport is the surface to volume ratio. Recall\nthat any three-dimensional object has a surface area and volume; the ratio of these two quantities is the surface-to-volume ratio.\nConsider a cell shaped like a perfect sphere: it has a surface area of 4\u03c0r2, and a volume of (4/3)\u03c0r3. The surface-to-volume ratio of\na sphere is 3/r; as the cell gets bigger, its surface to volume ratio decreases, making diffusion less efficient. The larger the size of\nthe sphere, or animal, the less surface area for diffusion it possesses.\nThe solution to producing larger organisms is for them to become multicellular. Specialization occurs in complex organisms,\nallowing cells to become more efficient at doing fewer tasks. For example, circulatory systems bring nutrients and remove waste,\nwhile respiratory systems provide oxygen for the cells and remove carbon dioxide from them. Other organ systems have\ndeveloped further specialization of cells and tissues and efficiently control body functions. Moreover, surface-to-volume ratio\napplies to other areas of animal development, such as the relationship between muscle mass and cross-sectional surface area in\nsupporting skeletons, and in the relationship between muscle mass and the generation and dissipation of heat.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this interactive site (http://openstax.org/l/nanoscopy) to see an entire animal (a zebrafish embryo) at the cellular and sub-\ncellular level. Use the zoom and navigation functions for a virtual nanoscopy exploration.\nAnimal Bioenergetics\nAll animals must obtain their energy from food they ingest or absorb. These nutrients are converted to adenosine triphosphate\n(ATP) for short-term storage and use by all cells. Some animals store energy for slightly longer times as glycogen, and others\nstore energy for much longer times in the form of triglycerides housed in specialized adipose tissues. No energy system is one\nhundred percent efficient, and an animal\u2019s metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat. If an animal can conserve\nthat heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature, it is classified as a warm-blooded animal and called an\nendotherm. The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur, fat, or feathers. The absence of insulation\nin ectothermic animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat.\nThe amount of energy expended by an animal over a specific time is called its metabolic rate. The rate is measured variously in\njoules, calories, or kilocalories (1000 calories). Carbohydrates and proteins contain about 4.5 to 5 kcal/g, and fat contains about 9\nkcal/g. Metabolic rate is estimated as the basal metabolic rate (BMR) in endothermic animals at rest and as the standard\nmetabolic rate (SMR) in ectotherms. Human males have a BMR of 1600 to 1800 kcal/day, and human females have a BMR of\n1300 to 1500 kcal/day. Even with insulation, endothermal animals require extensive amounts of energy to maintain a constant\nbody temperature. An ectotherm such as an alligator has an SMR of 60 kcal/day.\nEnergy Requirements Related to Body Size\nSmaller endothermic animals have a greater surface area for their mass than larger ones (Figure 33.4). Therefore, smaller\nanimals lose heat at a faster rate than larger animals and require more energy to maintain a constant internal temperature. This\nresults in a smaller endothermic animal having a higher BMR, per body weight, than a larger endothermic animal.\nFigure 33.4 The mouse has a much higher metabolic rate than the elephant. (credit \u201cmouse\u201d: modification of work by Magnus Kjaergaard;\n924\nChapter 33 \u2022 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncredit \u201celephant\u201d: modification of work by \u201cTheLizardQueen\u201d/Flickr)\nEnergy Requirements Related to Levels of Activity\nThe more active an animal is, the more energy is needed to maintain that activity, and the higher its BMR or SMR. The average\ndaily rate of energy consumption is about two to four times an animal\u2019s BMR or SMR. Humans are more sedentary than most\nanimals and have an average daily rate of only 1.5 times the BMR. The diet of an endothermic animal is determined by its BMR.\nFor example: the type of grasses, leaves, or shrubs that an herbivore eats affects the number of calories that it takes in. The\nrelative caloric content of herbivore foods, in descending order, is tall grasses > legumes > short grasses > forbs (any broad-\nleaved plant, not a grass) > subshrubs > annuals/biennials.\nEnergy Requirements Related to Environment\nAnimals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor. Torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in\nactivity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions. Torpor can be used by animals for long periods, such\nas entering a state of hibernation during the winter months, in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body\ntemperature. During hibernation, ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0\u00b0 C (32\u00b0 F), while a bear\u2019s internal\ntemperature is maintained higher at about 37\u00b0 C (99\u00b0 F).\nIf torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water, it is called estivation. Some desert animals\nuse this to survive the harshest months of the year. Torpor can occur on a daily basis; this is seen in bats and hummingbirds.\nWhile endothermy is limited in smaller animals by surface to volume ratio, some organisms can be smaller and still be\nendotherms because they employ daily torpor during the part of the day that is coldest. This allows them to conserve energy\nduring the colder parts of the day, when they consume more energy to maintain their body temperature.\nAnimal Body Planes and Cavities\nA standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes. A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions. A\nmidsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle, making two equal right and left halves. A frontal plane (also called a\ncoronal plane) separates the front from the back. A transverse plane (or, horizontal plane) divides the animal into upper and\nlower portions. This is sometimes called a cross section, and, if the transverse cut is at an angle, it is called an oblique plane.\nFigure 33.5 illustrates these planes on a goat (a four-legged animal) and a human being.\nFigure 33.5 Shown are the planes of a quadrupedal goat and a bipedal human. The midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in half, into\nright and left portions. The frontal plane divides the front and back, and the transverse plane divides the body into upper and lower\nportions.\nVertebrate animals have a number of defined body cavities, as illustrated in Figure 33.6. Two of these are major cavities that\ncontain smaller cavities within them. The dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the vertebral (or spinal) cavities. The ventral\ncavity contains the thoracic cavity, which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial cavity, which\n33.1 \u2022 Animal Form and Function\n925\nsurrounds the heart. The ventral cavity also contains the abdominopelvic cavity, which can be separated into the abdominal and\nthe pelvic cavities.\nFigure 33.6 Vertebrate animals have two major body cavities. The dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the spinal cavity. The ventral cavity\ncontains the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity. The thoracic cavity is separated from the abdominopelvic cavity by the\ndiaphragm. The abdominopelvic cavity is separated into the abdominal cavity and the pelvic cavity by an imaginary line parallel to the pelvis\nbones.

Research by these professionals might range from studies of how the human body reacts to car crashes to exploring\nhow to make seats more comfortable. Other nonacademic positions can be obtained in museums of natural history,\nanthropology, archaeology, or science and technology. These positions involve educating students from grade school through\ngraduate school. Physical anthropologists serve as education coordinators, collection managers, writers for museum\npublications, and as administrators. Zoos employ these professionals, especially if they have an expertise in primate biology;\nthey work in collection management and captive breeding programs for endangered species. Forensic science utilizes physical\nanthropology expertise in identifying human and animal remains, assisting in determining the cause of death, and for expert\ntestimony in trials.\n926\nChapter 33 \u2022 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n33.2 Animal Primary Tissues\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe epithelial tissues\n\u2022\nDiscuss the different types of connective tissues in animals\n\u2022\nDescribe three types of muscle tissues\n\u2022\nDescribe nervous tissue\nThe tissues of multicellular, complex animals are four primary types: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Recall that\ntissues are groups of similar cells (cells carrying out related functions). These tissues combine to form organs\u2014like the skin or\nkidney\u2014that have specific, specialized functions within the body. Organs are organized into organ systems to perform\nfunctions; examples include the circulatory system, which consists of the heart and blood vessels, and the digestive system,\nconsisting of several organs, including the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas. Organ systems come together to create an\nentire organism.\nEpithelial Tissues\nEpithelial tissues cover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer or\nmultiple layers of cells. The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of cells.\nEpithelia composed of a single layer of cells is called simple epithelia; epithelial tissue composed of multiple layers is called\nstratified epithelia. Table 33.2 summarizes the different types of epithelial tissues.\nDifferent Types of Epithelial Tissues\nCell\nshape\nDescription\nLocation\nsquamous\nflat, irregular round shape\nsimple: lung alveoli, capillaries; stratified: skin,\nmouth, vagina\ncuboidal\ncube shaped, central nucleus\nglands, renal tubules\ncolumnar\ntall, narrow, nucleus toward base; tall, narrow,\nnucleus along cell\nsimple: digestive tract; pseudostratified: respiratory\ntract\ntransitional\nround, simple but appear stratified\nurinary bladder\nTable 33.2\nSquamous Epithelia\nSquamous epithelial cells are generally round, flat, and have a small, centrally located nucleus. The cell outline is slightly\nirregular, and cells fit together to form a covering or lining. When the cells are arranged in a single layer (simple epithelia), they\nfacilitate diffusion in tissues, such as the areas of gas exchange in the lungs and the exchange of nutrients and waste at blood\ncapillaries.\n33.2 \u2022 Animal Primary Tissues\n927\nFigure 33.7 Squamous epithelia cells (a) have a slightly irregular shape, and a small, centrally located nucleus. These cells can be stratified\ninto layers, as in (b) this human cervix specimen. (credit b: modification of work by Ed Uthman; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nFigure 33.7a illustrates a layer of squamous cells with their membranes joined together to form an epithelium. Image Figure\n33.7b illustrates squamous epithelial cells arranged in stratified layers, where protection is needed on the body from outside\nabrasion and damage. This is called a stratified squamous epithelium and occurs in the skin and in tissues lining the mouth and\nvagina.\nCuboidal Epithelia\nCuboidal epithelial cells, shown in Figure 33.8, are cube-shaped with a single, central nucleus. They are most commonly found\nin a single layer representing a simple epithelia in glandular tissues throughout the body where they prepare and secrete\nglandular material. They are also found in the walls of tubules and in the ducts of the kidney and liver.\nFigure 33.8 Simple cuboidal epithelial cells line tubules in the mammalian kidney, where they are involved in filtering the blood.\nColumnar Epithelia\nColumnar epithelial cells are taller than they are wide: they resemble a stack of columns in an epithelial layer, and are most\ncommonly found in a single-layer arrangement. The nuclei of columnar epithelial cells in the digestive tract appear to be lined\nup at the base of the cells, as illustrated in Figure 33.9. These cells absorb material from the lumen of the digestive tract and\nprepare it for entry into the body through the circulatory and lymphatic systems.\n928\nChapter 33 \u2022 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 33.9 Simple columnar epithelial cells absorb material from the digestive tract. Goblet cells secrete mucus into the digestive tract\nlumen.\nColumnar epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract appear to be stratified. However, each cell is attached to the base membrane\nof the tissue and, therefore, they are simple tissues. The nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells, making it\nappear as though there is more than one layer, as seen in Figure 33.10. This is called pseudostratified, columnar epithelia. This\ncellular covering has cilia at the apical, or free, surface of the cells. The cilia enhance the movement of mucus and trapped\nparticles out of the respiratory tract, helping to protect the system from invasive microorganisms and harmful material that has\nbeen breathed into the body. Goblet cells are interspersed in some tissues (such as the lining of the trachea). The goblet cells\ncontain mucus that traps irritants, which in the case of the trachea keep these irritants from getting into the lungs.\nFigure 33.10 Pseudostratified columnar epithelia line the respiratory tract. They exist in one layer, but the arrangement of nuclei at\ndifferent levels makes it appear that there is more than one layer. Goblet cells interspersed between the columnar epithelial cells secrete\nmucus into the respiratory tract.\nTransitional Epithelia\nTransitional or uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system, primarily in the bladder and ureter. These cells are\narranged in a stratified layer, but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed, empty\nbladder, as illustrated in Figure 33.11. As the urinary bladder fills, the epithelial layer unfolds and expands to hold the volume of\nurine introduced into it. As the bladder fills, it expands and the lining becomes thinner. In other words, the tissue transitions\n33.2 \u2022 Animal Primary Tissues\n929\nfrom thick to thin.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 33.11 Transitional epithelia of the urinary bladder undergo changes in thickness depending on how full the bladder is.\nWhich of the following statements about types of epithelial cells is false?\na.\nSimple columnar epithelial cells line the tissue of the lung.\nb.\nSimple cuboidal epithelial cells are involved in the filtering of blood in the kidney.\nc.\nPseudostratisfied columnar epithilia occur in a single layer, but the arrangement of nuclei makes it appear that more than\none layer is present.\nd.\nTransitional epithelia change in thickness depending on how full the bladder is.\nConnective Tissues\nConnective tissues are made up of a matrix consisting of living cells and a nonliving substance, called the ground substance. The\nground substance is made of an organic substance (usually a protein) and an inorganic substance (usually a mineral or water).\nThe principal cell of connective tissues is the fibroblast. This cell makes the fibers found in nearly all of the connective tissues.\nFibroblasts are motile, able to carry out mitosis, and can synthesize whichever connective tissue is needed. Macrophages,\nlymphocytes, and, occasionally, leukocytes can be found in some of the tissues. Some tissues have specialized cells that are not\nfound in the others. The matrix in connective tissues gives the tissue its density. When a connective tissue has a high\nconcentration of cells or fibers, it has proportionally a less dense matrix.\nThe organic portion or protein fibers found in connective tissues are either collagen, elastic, or reticular fibers. Collagen fibers\nprovide strength to the tissue, preventing it from being torn or separated from the surrounding tissues. Elastic fibers are made\nof the protein elastin; this fiber can stretch to one and one half of its length and return to its original size and shape. Elastic\nfibers provide flexibility to the tissues. Reticular fibers are the third type of protein fiber found in connective tissues. This fiber\nconsists of thin strands of collagen that form a network of fibers to support the tissue and other organs to which it is connected.\nThe various types of connective tissues, the types of cells and fibers they are made of, and sample locations of the tissues is\nsummarized in Table 33.3.\nConnective Tissues\nTissue\nCells\nFibers\nLocation\nloose/areolar\nfibroblasts, macrophages, some\nlymphocytes, some neutrophils\nfew: collagen, elastic, reticular\naround blood vessels; anchors\nepithelia\nTable 33.3\n930\nChapter 33 \u2022 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nTissue\nCells\nFibers\nLocation\ndense, fibrous\nconnective\ntissue\nfibroblasts, macrophages\nmostly collagen\nirregular: skin; regular:\ntendons, ligaments\ncartilage\nchondrocytes, chondroblasts\nhyaline: few: collagen\nfibrocartilage: large amount of\ncollagen\nshark skeleton, fetal bones,\nhuman ears, intervertebral\ndiscs\nbone\nosteoblasts, osteocytes,\nosteoclasts\nsome: collagen, elastic\nvertebrate skeletons\nadipose\nadipocytes\nfew\nadipose (fat)\nblood\nred blood cells, white blood cells\nnone\nblood\nTable 33.3\nLoose/Areolar Connective Tissue\nLoose connective tissue, also called areolar connective tissue, has a sampling of all of the components of a connective tissue. As\nillustrated in Figure 33.12, loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts; macrophages are present as well. Collagen fibers are\nrelatively wide and stain a light pink, while elastic fibers are thin and stain dark blue to black. The space between the formed\nelements of the tissue is filled with the matrix. The material in the connective tissue gives it a loose consistency similar to a\ncotton ball that has been pulled apart. Loose connective tissue is found around every blood vessel and helps to keep the vessel in\nplace. The tissue is also found around and between most body organs. In summary, areolar tissue is tough, yet flexible, and\ncomprises membranes.\nFigure 33.12 Loose connective tissue is composed of loosely woven collagen and elastic fibers. The fibers and other components of the\nconnective tissue matrix are secreted by fibroblasts.\nFibrous Connective Tissue\nFibrous connective tissues contain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material. The fibers can be arranged\nirregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel. Irregularly arranged fibrous connective tissues are found in areas of\nthe body where stress occurs from all directions, such as the dermis of the skin. Regular fibrous connective tissue, shown in\nFigure 33.13, is found in tendons (which connect muscles to bones) and ligaments (which connect bones to bones).\n33.2 \u2022 Animal Primary Tissues\n931\nFigure 33.13 Fibrous connective tissue from the tendon has strands of collagen fibers lined up in parallel.\nCartilage\nCartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers. The cells, called chondrocytes,\nmake the matrix and fibers of the tissue. Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae.\nA cartilage with few collagen and elastic fibers is hyaline cartilage, illustrated in Figure 33.14. The lacunae are randomly scattered\nthroughout the tissue and the matrix takes on a milky or scrubbed appearance with routine histological stains. Sharks have\ncartilaginous skeletons, as does nearly the entire human skeleton during a specific pre-birth developmental stage. A remnant of\nthis cartilage persists in the outer portion of the human nose. Hyaline cartilage is also found at the ends of long bones, reducing\nfriction and cushioning the articulations of these bones.\nFigure 33.14 Hyaline cartilage consists of a matrix with cells called chondrocytes embedded in it. The chondrocytes exist in cavities in the\nmatrix called lacunae.\nElastic cartilage has a large amount of elastic fibers, giving it tremendous flexibility. The ears of most vertebrate animals contain\nthis cartilage as do portions of the larynx, or voice box. Fibrocartilage contains a large amount of collagen fibers, giving the\ntissue tremendous strength. Fibrocartilage comprises the intervertebral discs in vertebrate animals. Hyaline cartilage found in\nmovable joints such as the knee and shoulder becomes damaged as a result of age or trauma. Damaged hyaline cartilage is\nreplaced by fibrocartilage and results in the joints becoming \u201cstiff.\u201d\nBone\nBone, or osseous tissue, is a connective tissue that has a large amount of two different types of matrix material. The organic\nmatrix is similar to the matrix material found in other connective tissues, including some amount of collagen and elastic fibers.\nThis gives strength and flexibility to the tissue. The inorganic matrix consists of mineral salts\u2014mostly calcium salts\u2014that give\n932\nChapter 33 \u2022 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthe tissue hardness. Without adequate organic material in the matrix, the tissue breaks; without adequate inorganic material in\nthe matrix, the tissue bends.\nThere are three types of cells in bone: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are active in making bone for growth\nand remodeling. Osteoblasts deposit bone material into the matrix and, after the matrix surrounds them, they continue to live,\nbut in a reduced metabolic state as osteocytes. Osteocytes are found in lacunae of the bone. Osteoclasts are active in breaking\ndown bone for bone remodeling, and they provide access to calcium stored in tissues. Osteoclasts are usually found on the\nsurface of the tissue.\nBone can be divided into two types: compact and spongy. Compact bone is found in the shaft (or diaphysis) of a long bone and\nthe surface of the flat bones, while spongy bone is found in the end (or epiphysis) of a long bone. Compact bone is organized into\nsubunits called osteons, as illustrated in Figure 33.15. A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within\nthe Haversian canal, with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae. The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are\nmicrochannels called canaliculi; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells. Spongy bone is made of tiny plates\ncalled trabeculae; these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength. Over time, these plates can break causing the\nbone to become less resilient. Bone tissue forms the internal skeleton of vertebrate animals, providing structure to the animal\nand points of attachment for tendons.\n33.2 \u2022 Animal Primary Tissues\n933\nFigure 33.15 (a) Compact bone is a dense matrix on the outer surface of bone. Spongy bone, inside the compact bone, is porous with web-\nlike trabeculae. (b) Compact bone is organized into rings called osteons. Blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels are found in the\ncentral Haversian canal. Rings of lamellae surround the Haversian canal. Between the lamellae are cavities called lacunae. Canaliculi are\nmicrochannels connecting the lacunae together. (c) Osteoblasts surround the exterior of the bone. Osteoclasts bore tunnels into the bone\nand osteocytes are found in the lacunae.\nAdipose Tissue\nAdipose tissue, or fat tissue, is considered a connective tissue even though it does not have fibroblasts or a real matrix and only\nhas a few fibers. Adipose tissue is made up of cells called adipocytes that collect and store fat in the form of triglycerides, for\nenergy metabolism. Adipose tissues additionally serve as insulation to help maintain body temperatures, allowing animals to be\nendothermic, and they function as cushioning against damage to body organs. Under a microscope, adipose tissue cells appear\nempty due to the extraction of fat during the processing of the material for viewing, as seen in Figure 33.16. The thin lines in the\nimage are the cell membranes, and the nuclei are the small, black dots at the edges of the cells.\n934\nChapter 33 \u2022 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 33.16 Adipose is a connective tissue is made up of cells called adipocytes. Adipocytes have small nuclei localized at the cell edge.\nBlood\nBlood is considered a connective tissue because it has a matrix, as shown in Figure 33.17. The living cell types are red blood cells\n(RBC), also called erythrocytes, and white blood cells (WBC), also called leukocytes. The fluid portion of whole blood, its matrix,\nis commonly called plasma.\nFigure 33.17 Blood is a connective tissue that has a fluid matrix, called plasma, and no fibers. Erythrocytes (red blood cells), the\npredominant cell type, are involved in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Also present are various leukocytes (white blood cells)\ninvolved in immune response.\nThe cell found in greatest abundance in blood is the erythrocyte. Erythrocytes are counted in millions in a blood sample: the\naverage number of red blood cells in primates is 4.7 to 5.5 million cells per microliter. Erythrocytes are consistently the same size\nin a species, but vary in size between species. For example, the average diameter of a primate red blood cell is 7.5 \u00b5l, a dog is\nclose at 7.0 \u00b5l, but a cat\u2019s RBC diameter is 5.9 \u00b5l. Sheep erythrocytes are even smaller at 4.6 \u00b5l. Mammalian erythrocytes lose\ntheir nuclei and mitochondria when they are released from the bone marrow where they are made. Fish, amphibian, and avian\nred blood cells maintain their nuclei and mitochondria throughout the cell\u2019s life. The principal job of an erythrocyte is to carry\nand deliver oxygen to the tissues.\nLeukocytes are the predominant white blood cells found in the peripheral blood. Leukocytes are counted in the thousands in the\nblood with measurements expressed as ranges: primate counts range from 4,800 to 10,800 cells per \u00b5l, dogs from 5,600 to\n19,200 cells per \u00b5l, cats from 8,000 to 25,000 cells per \u00b5l, cattle from 4,000 to 12,000 cells per \u00b5l, and pigs from 11,000 to 22,000\ncells per \u00b5l.\nLymphocytes function primarily in the immune response to foreign antigens or material. Different types of lymphocytes make\nantibodies tailored to the foreign antigens and control the production of those antibodies. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells and\nthey participate in one of the early lines of defense against microbial invaders, aiding in the removal of bacteria that has entered\n33.2 \u2022 Animal Primary Tissues\n935\nthe body. Another leukocyte that is found in the peripheral blood is the monocyte. Monocytes give rise to phagocytic\nmacrophages that clean up dead and damaged cells in the body, whether they are foreign or from the host animal. Two\nadditional leukocytes in the blood are eosinophils and basophils\u2014both help to facilitate the inflammatory response.\nThe slightly granular material among the cells is a cytoplasmic fragment of a cell in the bone marrow. This is called a platelet or\nthrombocyte. Platelets participate in the stages leading up to coagulation of the blood to stop bleeding through damaged blood\nvessels. Blood has a number of functions, but primarily it transports material through the body to bring nutrients to cells and\nremove waste material from them.\nMuscle Tissues\nThere are three types of muscle in animal bodies: smooth, skeletal, and cardiac. They differ by the presence or absence of\nstriations or bands, the number and location of nuclei, whether they are voluntarily or involuntarily controlled, and their\nlocation within the body. Table 33.4 summarizes these differences.\nTypes of Muscles\nType of Muscle\nStriations\nNuclei\nControl\nLocation\nsmooth\nno\nsingle, in center\ninvoluntary\nvisceral organs\nskeletal\nyes\nmany, at periphery\nvoluntary\nskeletal muscles\ncardiac\nyes\nsingle, in center\ninvoluntary\nheart\nTable 33.4\nSmooth Muscle\nSmooth muscle does not have striations in its cells. It has a single, centrally located nucleus, as shown in Figure 33.18.\nConstriction of smooth muscle occurs under involuntary, autonomic nervous control and in response to local conditions in the\ntissues. Smooth muscle tissue is also called non-striated as it lacks the banded appearance of skeletal and cardiac muscle. The\nwalls of blood vessels, the tubes of the digestive system, and the tubes of the reproductive systems are composed of mostly\nsmooth muscle.\nFigure 33.18 Smooth muscle cells do not have striations, while skeletal muscle cells do. Cardiac muscle cells have striations, but, unlike\nthe multinucleate skeletal cells, they have only one nucleus. Cardiac muscle tissue also has intercalated discs, specialized regions running\nalong the plasma membrane that join adjacent cardiac muscle cells and assist in passing an electrical impulse from cell to cell.\nSkeletal Muscle\nSkeletal muscle has striations across its cells caused by the arrangement of the contractile proteins actin and myosin. These\nmuscle cells are relatively long and have multiple nuclei along the edge of the cell. Skeletal muscle is under voluntary, somatic\nnervous system control and is found in the muscles that move bones. Figure 33.18 illustrates the histology of skeletal muscle.\nCardiac Muscle\nCardiac muscle, shown in Figure 33.18, is found only in the heart. Like skeletal muscle, it has cross striations in its cells, but\ncardiac muscle has a single, centrally located nucleus. Cardiac muscle is not under voluntary control but can be influenced by the\nautonomic nervous system to speed up or slow down. An added feature to cardiac muscle cells is a line than extends along the\nend of the cell as it abuts the next cardiac cell in the row. This line is called an intercalated disc: it assists in passing electrical\nimpulse efficiently from one cell to the next and maintains the strong connection between neighboring cardiac cells.\n936\nChapter 33 \u2022 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nNervous Tissues\nNervous tissues are made of cells specialized to receive and transmit electrical impulses from specific areas of the body and to\nsend them to specific locations in the body. The main cell of the nervous system is the neuron, illustrated in Figure 33.19. The\nlarge structure with a central nucleus is the cell body of the neuron. Projections from the cell body are either dendrites\nspecialized in receiving input or a single axon specialized in transmitting impulses. Some glial cells are also shown. Astrocytes\nregulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is\ntransferred more efficiently. Other glial cells that are not shown support the nutritional and waste requirements of the neuron.\nSome of the glial cells are phagocytic and remove debris or damaged cells from the tissue. A nerve consists of neurons and glial\ncells.\nFigure 33.19 The neuron has projections called dendrites that receive signals and projections called axons that send signals. Also shown\nare two types of glial cells: astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the\nelectrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick through the interactive review (http://openstax.org/l/tissues) to learn more about epithelial tissues.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nPathologist\nA pathologist is a medical doctor or veterinarian who has specialized in the laboratory detection of disease in animals, including\nhumans. These professionals complete medical school education and follow it with an extensive post-graduate residency at a\nmedical center. A pathologist may oversee clinical laboratories for the evaluation of body tissue and blood samples for the\ndetection of disease or infection. They examine tissue specimens through a microscope to identify cancers and other diseases.\nSome pathologists perform autopsies to determine the cause of death and the progression of disease.\n33.3 Homeostasis\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDefine homeostasis\n\u2022\nDescribe the factors affecting homeostasis\n\u2022\nDiscuss positive and negative feedback mechanisms used in homeostasis\n\u2022\nDescribe thermoregulation of endothermic and ectothermic animals\nAnimal organs and organ systems constantly adjust to internal and external changes through a process called homeostasis\n(\u201csteady state\u201d). These changes might be in the level of glucose or calcium in blood or in external temperatures. Homeostasis\n33.3 \u2022 Homeostasis\n937\nmeans to maintain dynamic equilibrium in the body. It is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the\nbody\u2019s systems encounter. It is equilibrium because body functions are kept within specific ranges. Even an animal that is\napparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium.\nHomeostatic Process\nThe goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a set point. While there are normal\nfluctuations from the set point, the body\u2019s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point. A change in the internal or\nexternal environment is called a stimulus and is detected by a receptor; the response of the system is to adjust the deviation\nparameter toward the set point. For instance, if the body becomes too warm, adjustments are made to cool the animal. If the\nblood\u2019s glucose rises after a meal, adjustments are made to lower the blood glucose level by getting the nutrient into tissues that\nneed it or to store it for later use.\nControl of Homeostasis\nWhen a change occurs in an animal\u2019s environment, an adjustment must be made. The receptor senses the change in the\nenvironment, then sends a signal to the control center (in most cases, the brain) which in turn generates a response that is\nsignaled to an effector. The effector is a muscle (that contracts or relaxes) or a gland that secretes. Homeostatsis is maintained by\nnegative feedback loops. Positive feedback loops actually push the organism further out of homeostasis, but may be necessary\nfor life to occur. Homeostasis is controlled by the nervous and endocrine system of mammals.\nNegative Feedback Mechanisms\nAny homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a negative feedback loop. It may either increase or\ndecrease the stimulus, but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed it. In other words, if a level\nis too high, the body does something to bring it down, and conversely, if a level is too low, the body does something to make it go\nup. Hence the term negative feedback. An example is animal maintenance of blood glucose levels. When an animal has eaten,\nblood glucose levels rise. This is sensed by the nervous system. Specialized cells in the pancreas sense this, and the hormone\ninsulin is released by the endocrine system. Insulin causes blood glucose levels to decrease, as would be expected in a negative\nfeedback system, as illustrated in Figure 33.20. However, if an animal has not eaten and blood glucose levels decrease, this is\nsensed in another group of cells in the pancreas, and the hormone glucagon is released causing glucose levels to increase. This is\nstill a negative feedback loop, but not in the direction expected by the use of the term \u201cnegative.\u201d Another example of an increase\nas a result of the feedback loop is the control of blood calcium. If calcium levels decrease, specialized cells in the parathyroid\ngland sense this and release parathyroid hormone (PTH), causing an increased absorption of calcium through the intestines and\nkidneys and, possibly, the breakdown of bone in order to liberate calcium. The effects of PTH are to raise blood levels of the\nelement. Negative feedback loops are the predominant mechanism used in homeostasis.\nFigure 33.20 Blood sugar levels are controlled by a negative feedback loop. (credit: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)\nPositive Feedback Loop\nA positive feedback loop maintains the direction of the stimulus, possibly accelerating it. Few examples of positive feedback\nloops exist in animal bodies, but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting, or coagulation.\n938\nChapter 33 \u2022 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nAs one clotting factor is activated, it activates the next factor in sequence until a fibrin clot is achieved. The direction is\nmaintained, not changed, so this is positive feedback. Another example of positive feedback is uterine contractions during\nchildbirth, as illustrated in Figure 33.21. The hormone oxytocin, made by the endocrine system, stimulates the contraction of the\nuterus. This produces pain sensed by the nervous system. Instead of lowering the oxytocin and causing the pain to subside,\nmore oxytocin is produced until the contractions are powerful enough to produce childbirth.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 33.21 The birth of a human infant is the result of positive feedback.\nState whether each of the following processes is regulated by a positive feedback loop or a negative feedback loop.\na.\nA person feels satiated after eating a large meal.\nb.\nThe blood has plenty of red blood cells. As a result, erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of new red\nblood cells, is no longer released from the kidney.\nSet Point\nIt is possible to adjust a system\u2019s set point. When this happens, the feedback loop works to maintain the new setting. An\nexample of this is blood pressure: over time, the normal or set point for blood pressure can increase as a result of continued\nincreases in blood pressure. The body no longer recognizes the elevation as abnormal and no attempt is made to return to the\nlower set point. The result is the maintenance of an elevated blood pressure that can have harmful effects on the body.\nMedication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point in the system to a more healthy level. This is called a process of\nalteration of the set point in a feedback loop.\nChanges can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system. This is called\nacclimatization. This occurs, for instance, when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than that to which it is accustomed. In\norder to adjust to the lower oxygen levels at the new altitude, the body increases the number of red blood cells circulating in the\nblood to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues. Another example of acclimatization is animals that have seasonal\nchanges in their coats: a heavier coat in the winter ensures adequate heat retention, and a light coat in summer assists in\nkeeping body temperature from rising to harmful levels.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFeedback mechanisms can be understood in terms of driving a race car along a track: watch a short video lesson on positive and\nnegative feedback loops.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/feedback_loops)\n33.3 \u2022 Homeostasis\n939\nHomeostasis: Thermoregulation\nBody temperature affects body activities. Generally, as body temperature rises, enzyme activity rises as well. For every ten\ndegree centigrade rise in temperature, enzyme activity doubles, up to a point. Body proteins, including enzymes, begin to\ndenature and lose their function with high heat (around 50oC for mammals). Enzyme activity will decrease by half for every ten\ndegree centigrade drop in temperature, to the point of freezing, with a few exceptions. Some fish can withstand freezing solid\nand return to normal with thawing.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this Discovery Channel video on thermoregulation to see illustrations of this process in a variety of animals.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/thermoregulate)\nEndotherms and Ectotherms\nAnimals can be divided into two groups: some maintain a constant body temperature in the face of differing environmental\ntemperatures, while others have a body temperature that is the same as their environment and thus varies with the\nenvironment. Animals that rely on external temperatures to set their body temperature are ectotherms. This group has been\ncalled cold-blooded, but the term may not apply to an animal in the desert with a very warm body temperature. In contrast to\nectotherms, poikilotherms are animals with constantly varying internal temperatures. An animal that maintains a constant\nbody temperature in the face of environmental changes is called a homeotherm. Endotherms are animals that rely on internal\nsources for maintenance of relatively constant body temperature in varying environmental temperatures. These animals are able\nto maintain a level of metabolic activity at cooler temperature, which an ectotherm cannot due to differing enzyme levels of\nactivity. It is worth mentioning that some ectotherms and poikilotherms have relatively constant body temperatures due to the\nconstant environmental temperatures in their habitats. These animals are so-called ectothermic homeotherms, like some deep\nsea fish species.\nHeat can be exchanged between an animal and its environment through four mechanisms: radiation, evaporation, convection,\nand conduction (Figure 33.22). Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic \u201cheat\u201d waves. Heat comes from the sun in this\nmanner and radiates from dry skin the same way. Heat can be removed with liquid from a surface during evaporation. This\noccurs when a mammal sweats. Convection currents of air remove heat from the surface of dry skin as the air passes over it.\nHeat will be conducted from one surface to another during direct contact with the surfaces, such as an animal resting on a warm\nrock.\n940\nChapter 33 \u2022 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 33.22 Heat can be exchanged by four mechanisms: (a) radiation, (b) evaporation, (c) convection, or (d) conduction.

In certain climates, endothermic animals have some form of insulation,\nsuch as fur, fat, feathers, or some combination thereof. Animals with thick fur or feathers create an insulating layer of air\nbetween their skin and internal organs. Polar bears and seals live and swim in a subfreezing environment and yet maintain a\nconstant, warm, body temperature. The arctic fox, for example, uses its fluffy tail as extra insulation when it curls up to sleep in\ncold weather. Mammals have a residual effect from shivering and increased muscle activity: arrector pili muscles cause \u201cgoose\nbumps,\u201d causing small hairs to stand up when the individual is cold; this has the intended effect of increasing body temperature.\nMammals use layers of fat to achieve the same end. Loss of significant amounts of body fat will compromise an individual\u2019s\nability to conserve heat.\nEndotherms use their circulatory systems to help maintain body temperature. Vasodilation brings more blood and heat to the\nbody surface, facilitating radiation and evaporative heat loss, which helps to cool the body. Vasoconstriction reduces blood flow\nin peripheral blood vessels, forcing blood toward the core and the vital organs found there, and conserving heat. Some animals\nhave adaptions to their circulatory system that enable them to transfer heat from arteries to veins, warming blood returning to\nthe heart. This is called a countercurrent heat exchange; it prevents the cold venous blood from cooling the heart and other\ninternal organs. This adaption can be shut down in some animals to prevent overheating the internal organs. The countercurrent\nadaption is found in many animals, including dolphins, sharks, bony fish, bees, and hummingbirds. In contrast, similar\nadaptations can help cool endotherms when needed, such as dolphin flukes and elephant ears.\nSome ectothermic animals use changes in their behavior to help regulate body temperature. For example, a desert ectothermic\nanimal may simply seek cooler areas during the hottest part of the day in the desert to keep from getting too warm. The same\nanimals may climb onto rocks to capture heat during a cold desert night. Some animals seek water to aid evaporation in cooling\nthem, as seen with reptiles. Other ectotherms use group activity such as the activity of bees to warm a hive to survive winter.\nMany animals, especially mammals, use metabolic waste heat as a heat source. When muscles are contracted, most of the\nenergy from the ATP used in muscle actions is wasted energy that translates into heat. Severe cold elicits a shivering reflex that\ngenerates heat for the body. Many species also have a type of adipose tissue called brown fat that specializes in generating heat.\n33.3 \u2022 Homeostasis\n941\nNeural Control of Thermoregulation\nThe nervous system is important to thermoregulation, as illustrated in Figure 33.22. The processes of homeostasis and\ntemperature control are centered in the hypothalamus of the advanced animal brain.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 33.23 The body is able to regulate temperature in response to signals from the nervous system.\nWhen bacteria are destroyed by leuckocytes, pyrogens are released into the blood. Pyrogens reset the body\u2019s thermostat to a\nhigher temperature, resulting in fever. How might pyrogens cause the body temperature to rise?\nThe hypothalamus maintains the set point for body temperature through reflexes that cause vasodilation and sweating when the\nbody is too warm, or vasoconstriction and shivering when the body is too cold. It responds to chemicals from the body. When a\nbacterium is destroyed by phagocytic leukocytes, chemicals called endogenous pyrogens are released into the blood. These\npyrogens circulate to the hypothalamus and reset the thermostat. This allows the body\u2019s temperature to increase in what is\ncommonly called a fever. An increase in body temperature causes iron to be conserved, which reduces a nutrient needed by\nbacteria. An increase in body heat also increases the activity of the animal\u2019s enzymes and protective cells while inhibiting the\nenzymes and activity of the invading microorganisms. Finally, heat itself may also kill the pathogen. A fever that was once\nthought to be a complication of an infection is now understood to be a normal defense mechanism.\n942\nChapter 33 \u2022 The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nacclimatization\nalteration in a body system in response to\nenvironmental change\nalteration\nchange of the set point in a homeostatic system\napodeme\ningrowth of an animal\u2019s exoskeleton that\nfunctions as an attachment site for muscles\nasymmetrical\ndescribes animals with no axis of symmetry\nin their body pattern\nbasal metabolic rate (BMR)\nmetabolic rate at rest in\nendothermic animals\ncanaliculus\nmicrochannel that connects the lacunae and\naids diffusion between cells\ncartilage\ntype of connective tissue with a large amount of\nground substance matrix, cells called chondrocytes, and\nsome amount of fibers\nchondrocyte\ncell found in cartilage\ncolumnar epithelia\nepithelia made of cells taller than they\nare wide, specialized in absorption\nconnective tissue\ntype of tissue made of cells, ground\nsubstance matrix, and fibers\ncuboidal epithelia\nepithelia made of cube-shaped cells,\nspecialized in glandular functions\ndorsal cavity\nbody cavity on the posterior or back portion\nof an animal; includes the cranial and vertebral cavities\nectotherm\nanimal incapable of maintaining a relatively\nconstant internal body temperature\nendotherm\nanimal capable of maintaining a relatively\nconstant internal body temperature\nepithelial tissue\ntissue that either lines or covers organs or\nother tissues\nestivation\ntorpor in response to extremely high\ntemperatures and low water availability\nfibrous connective tissue\ntype of connective tissue with a\nhigh concentration of fibers\nfrontal (coronal) plane\nplane cutting through an animal\nseparating the individual into front and back portions\nfusiform\nanimal body shape that is tubular and tapered at\nboth ends\nhibernation\ntorpor over a long period of time, such as a\nwinter\nhomeostasis\ndynamic equilibrium maintaining\nappropriate body functions\nlacuna\nspace in cartilage and bone that contains living cells\nloose (areolar) connective tissue\ntype of connective tissue\nwith small amounts of cells, matrix, and fibers; found\naround blood vessels\nmatrix\ncomponent of connective tissue made of both living\nand nonliving (ground substances) cells\nmidsagittal plane\nplane cutting through an animal\nseparating the individual into even right and left sides\nnegative feedback loop\nfeedback to a control mechanism\nthat increases or decreases a stimulus instead of\nmaintaining it\nosteon\nsubunit of compact bone\npositive feedback loop\nfeedback to a control mechanism\nthat continues the direction of a stimulus\npseudostratified\nlayer of epithelia that appears\nmultilayered, but is a simple covering\nsagittal plane\nplane cutting through an animal separating\nthe individual into right and left sides\nset point\nmidpoint or target point in homeostasis\nsimple epithelia\nsingle layer of epithelial cells\nsquamous epithelia\ntype of epithelia made of flat cells,\nspecialized in aiding diffusion or preventing abrasion\nstandard metabolic rate (SMR)\nmetabolic rate at rest in\nectothermic animals\nstratified epithelia\nmultiple layers of epithelial cells\nthermoregulation\nregulation of body temperature\ntorpor\ndecrease in activity and metabolism that allows an\nanimal to survive adverse conditions\ntrabecula\ntiny plate that makes up spongy bone and gives it\nstrength\ntransitional epithelia\nepithelia that can transition for\nappearing multilayered to simple; also called\nuroepithelial\ntransverse (horizontal) plane\nplane cutting through an\nanimal separating the individual into upper and lower\nportions\nventral cavity\nbody cavity on the anterior or front portion\nof an animal that includes the thoracic cavities and the\nabdominopelvic cavities\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n33.1 Animal Form and Function\nAnimal bodies come in a variety of sizes and shapes.

While plants can obtain the molecules\nrequired for cellular function through the process of photosynthesis, most animals obtain their nutrients\nby the consumption of other organisms. At the cellular level, the biological molecules necessary for\nanimal function are amino acids, lipid molecules, nucleotides, and simple sugars. However, the food\nconsumed consists of protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates. Animals must convert these\nmacromolecules into the simple molecules required for maintaining cellular functions, such as\nassembling new molecules, cells, and tissues. The conversion of the food consumed to the nutrients\nrequired is a multistep process involving digestion and absorption. During digestion, food particles are\nbroken down to smaller components, and later, they are absorbed by the body.\nOne of the challenges in human nutrition is maintaining a balance between food intake, storage, and\nenergy expenditure. Imbalances can have serious health consequences. For example, eating too much\nfood while not expending much energy leads to obesity, which in turn will increase the risk of developing\nillnesses such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The recent rise in obesity and related\ndiseases makes understanding the role of diet and nutrition in maintaining good health all the more\nimportant.\nChapter Outline\n34.1 Digestive Systems\n34.2 Nutrition and\nEnergy Production\n34.3 Digestive System\nProcesses\n34.4 Digestive System\nRegulation\n34.1 Digestive Systems\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain the processes of digestion and absorption\n\u2022\nCompare and contrast different types of digestive systems\n\u2022\nExplain the specialized functions of the organs involved in processing food in the body\n\u2022\nDescribe the ways in which organs work together to digest food and absorb nutrients\nAnimals obtain their nutrition from the consumption of other organisms. Depending on their diet, animals\ncan be classified into the following categories: plant eaters (herbivores), meat eaters (carnivores), and those\nthat eat both plants and animals (omnivores). The nutrients and macromolecules present in food are not\nimmediately accessible to the cells. There are a number of processes that modify food within the animal body\nin order to make the nutrients and organic molecules accessible for cellular function. As animals evolved in\ncomplexity of form and function, their digestive systems have also evolved to accommodate their various\ndietary needs.\nHerbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores\nHerbivores are animals whose primary food source is plant-based. Examples of herbivores, as shown in\nFigure 34.2 include vertebrates like deer, koalas, and some bird species, as well as invertebrates such as\ncrickets and caterpillars. These animals have evolved digestive systems capable of handling large amounts of\nplant material. Herbivores can be further classified into frugivores (fruit-eaters), granivores (seed eaters),\nnectivores (nectar feeders), and folivores (leaf eaters).\nFigure 34.2 Herbivores, like this (a) mule deer and (b) monarch caterpillar, eat primarily plant material. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Bill Ebbesen; credit b: modification of work by Doug Bowman)\nCarnivores are animals that eat other animals. The word carnivore is derived from Latin and literally means\n\u201cmeat eater.\u201d Wild cats such as lions, shown in Figure 34.3a and tigers are examples of vertebrate carnivores,\nas are snakes and sharks, while invertebrate carnivores include sea stars, spiders, and ladybugs, shown in\nFigure 34.3b. Obligate carnivores are those that rely entirely on animal flesh to obtain their nutrients;\nexamples of obligate carnivores are members of the cat family, such as lions and cheetahs. Facultative\ncarnivores are those that also eat non-animal food in addition to animal food. Note that there is no clear line\nthat differentiates facultative carnivores from omnivores; dogs would be considered facultative carnivores.\n948\nChapter 34 \u2022 Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 34.3 Carnivores like the (a) lion eat primarily meat. The (b) ladybug is also a carnivore that consumes small insects called aphids.\n(credit a: modification of work by Kevin Pluck; credit b: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)\nOmnivores are animals that eat both plant- and animal-derived food. In Latin, omnivore means to eat everything. Humans,\nbears (shown in Figure 34.4a), and chickens are example of vertebrate omnivores; invertebrate omnivores include cockroaches\nand crayfish (shown in Figure 34.4b).\nFigure 34.4 Omnivores like the (a) bear and (b) crayfish eat both plant and animal based food. (credit a: modification of work by Dave\nMenke; credit b: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)\nInvertebrate Digestive Systems\nAnimals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they consume. The\nsimplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion.\nPlatyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of\ndigestion. Gastrovascular cavities, as shown in Figure 34.5a, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the\n\u201cmouth\u201d, which also serves as an \u201canus\u201d. Ingested material enters the mouth and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity. Cells\nwithin the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that breakdown the food. The food particles are engulfed by the cells lining the\ngastrovascular cavity.\nThe alimentary canal, shown in Figure 34.5b, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an\nanus at the other. Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal. Once the food is ingested through the\nmouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard where it is\nchurned and digested. From the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the waste is\neliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus.\n34.1 \u2022 Digestive Systems\n949\nFigure 34.5 (a) A gastrovascular cavity has a single opening through which food is ingested and waste is excreted, as shown in this hydra\nand in this jellyfish medusa. (b) An alimentary canal has two openings: a mouth for ingesting food, and an anus for eliminating waste, as\nshown in this nematode.\nVertebrate Digestive Systems\nVertebrates have evolved more complex digestive systems to adapt to their dietary needs. Some animals have a single stomach,\nwhile others have multi-chambered stomachs. Birds have developed a digestive system adapted to eating unmasticated food.\nMonogastric: Single-chambered Stomach\nAs the word monogastric suggests, this type of digestive system consists of one (\u201cmono\u201d) stomach chamber (\u201cgastric\u201d). Humans\nand many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in Figure 34.6ab. The process of digestion begins with the\nmouth and the intake of food. The teeth play an important role in masticating (chewing) or physically breaking down food into\nsmaller particles. The enzymes present in saliva also begin to chemically breakdown food. The esophagus is a long tube that\nconnects the mouth to the stomach. Using peristalsis, or wave-like smooth muscle contractions, the muscles of the esophagus\npush the food towards the stomach. In order to speed up the actions of enzymes in the stomach, the stomach is an extremely\nacidic environment, with a pH between 1.5 and 2.5. The gastric juices, which include enzymes in the stomach, act on the food\nparticles and continue the process of digestion. Further breakdown of food takes place in the small intestine where enzymes\nproduced by the liver, the small intestine, and the pancreas continue the process of digestion. The nutrients are absorbed into\nthe bloodstream across the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small intestines. The waste material travels on to the large\nintestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste material is compacted into feces; it is stored until it is excreted through\nthe rectum.\n950\nChapter 34 \u2022 Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 34.6 (a) Humans and herbivores, such as the (b) rabbit, have a monogastric digestive system. However, in the rabbit the small\nintestine and cecum are enlarged to allow more time to digest plant material. The enlarged organ provides more surface area for absorption\nof nutrients. Rabbits digest their food twice: the first time food passes through the digestive system, it collects in the cecum, and then it\npasses as soft feces called cecotrophes. The rabbit re-ingests these cecotrophes to further digest them.\nAvian\nBirds face special challenges when it comes to obtaining nutrition from food. They do not have teeth and so their digestive\nsystem, shown in Figure 34.7, must be able to process un-masticated food. Birds have evolved a variety of beak types that reflect\nthe vast variety in their diet, ranging from seeds and insects to fruits and nuts. Because most birds fly, their metabolic rates are\nhigh in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low. The stomach of birds has two chambers: the\nproventriculus, where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach, and the gizzard, where the\nfood is stored, soaked, and mechanically ground. The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated.\nMost of the chemical digestion and absorption happens in the intestine and the waste is excreted through the cloaca.\n34.1 \u2022 Digestive Systems\n951\nFigure 34.7 The avian esophagus has a pouch, called a crop, which stores food. Food passes from the crop to the first of two stomachs,\ncalled the proventriculus, which contains digestive juices that breakdown food. From the proventriculus, the food enters the second\nstomach, called the gizzard, which grinds food. Some birds swallow stones or grit, which are stored in the gizzard, to aid the grinding\nprocess. Birds do not have separate openings to excrete urine and feces. Instead, uric acid from the kidneys is secreted into the large\nintestine and combined with waste from the digestive process. This waste is excreted through an opening called the cloaca.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nAvian Adaptations\nBirds have a highly efficient, simplified digestive system. Recent fossil evidence has shown that the evolutionary divergence of\nbirds from other land animals was characterized by streamlining and simplifying the digestive system. Unlike many other\nanimals, birds do not have teeth to chew their food. In place of lips, they have sharp pointy beaks. The horny beak, lack of jaws,\nand the smaller tongue of the birds can be traced back to their dinosaur ancestors. The emergence of these changes seems to\ncoincide with the inclusion of seeds in the bird diet. Seed-eating birds have beaks that are shaped for grabbing seeds and the\ntwo-compartment stomach allows for delegation of tasks. Since birds need to remain light in order to fly, their metabolic rates\nare very high, which means they digest their food very quickly and need to eat often. Contrast this with the ruminants, where\nthe digestion of plant matter takes a very long time.\nRuminants\nRuminants are mainly herbivores like cows, sheep, and goats, whose entire diet consists of eating large amounts of roughage or\nfiber. They have evolved digestive systems that help them digest vast amounts of cellulose. An interesting feature of the\nruminants\u2019 mouth is that they do not have upper incisor teeth. They use their lower teeth, tongue and lips to tear and chew their\nfood. From the mouth, the food travels to the esophagus and on to the stomach.\n952\nChapter 34 \u2022 Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nTo help digest the large amount of plant material, the stomach of the ruminants is a multi-chambered organ, as illustrated in\nFigure 34.8. The four compartments of the stomach are called the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. These chambers\ncontain many microbes that breakdown cellulose and ferment ingested food. The abomasum is the \u201ctrue\u201d stomach and is the\nequivalent of the monogastric stomach chamber where gastric juices are secreted. The four-compartment gastric chamber\nprovides larger space and the microbial support necessary to digest plant material in ruminants. The fermentation process\nproduces large amounts of gas in the stomach chamber, which must be eliminated. As in other animals, the small intestine plays\nan important role in nutrient absorption, and the large intestine helps in the elimination of waste.\nFigure 34.8 Ruminant animals, such as goats and cows, have four stomachs. The first two stomachs, the rumen and the reticulum, contain\nprokaryotes and protists that are able to digest cellulose fiber. The ruminant regurgitates cud from the reticulum, chews it, and swallows it\ninto a third stomach, the omasum, which removes water. The cud then passes onto the fourth stomach, the abomasum, where it is digested\nby enzymes produced by the ruminant.\nPseudo-ruminants\nSome animals, such as camels and alpacas, are pseudo-ruminants. They eat a lot of plant material and roughage. Digesting\nplant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule cellulose. The digestive enzymes of these\nanimals cannot breakdown cellulose, but microorganisms present in the digestive system can. Therefore, the digestive system\nmust be able to handle large amounts of roughage and breakdown the cellulose. Pseudo-ruminants have a three-chamber\nstomach in the digestive system. However, their cecum\u2014a pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine containing\nmany microorganisms that are necessary for the digestion of plant materials\u2014is large and is the site where the roughage is\nfermented and digested. These animals do not have a rumen but have an omasum, abomasum, and reticulum.\nParts of the Digestive System\nThe vertebrate digestive system is designed to facilitate the transformation of food matter into the nutrient components that\nsustain organisms.\nOral Cavity\nThe oral cavity, or mouth, is the point of entry of food into the digestive system, illustrated in Figure 34.9. The food consumed is\nbroken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food.\nThe extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth. As food is being chewed, saliva, produced by the salivary\nglands, mixes with the food. Saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals. There are three major glands\nthat secrete saliva\u2014the parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual. Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers\n34.1 \u2022 Digestive Systems\n953\nthe pH of the food. Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes, which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay\nby inhibiting growth of some bacteria. Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of\nconverting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose. Another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the\ntongue. Lipases are a class of enzymes that can breakdown triglycerides. The lingual lipase begins the breakdown of fat\ncomponents in the food. The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the\nbolus for swallowing. The tongue helps in swallowing\u2014moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx. The pharynx opens\nto two passageways: the trachea, which leads to the lungs, and the esophagus, which leads to the stomach. The trachea has an\nopening called the glottis, which is covered by a cartilaginous flap called the epiglottis. When swallowing, the epiglottis closes\nthe glottis and food passes into the esophagus and not the trachea. This arrangement allows food to be kept out of the trachea.\nFigure 34.9 Digestion of food begins in the (a) oral cavity. Food is masticated by teeth and moistened by saliva secreted from the (b)\nsalivary glands. Enzymes in the saliva begin to digest starches and fats. With the help of the tongue, the resulting bolus is moved into the\nesophagus by swallowing. (credit: modification of work by the National Cancer Institute)\nEsophagus\nThe esophagus is a tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach. The chewed and softened food passes through the\nesophagus after being swallowed. The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo a series of wave like movements called\nperistalsis that push the food toward the stomach, as illustrated in Figure 34.10. The peristalsis wave is unidirectional\u2014it moves\nfood from the mouth to the stomach, and reverse movement is not possible. The peristaltic movement of the esophagus is an\ninvoluntary reflex; it takes place in response to the act of swallowing.\nFigure 34.10 The esophagus transfers food from the mouth to the stomach through peristaltic movements.\nA ring-like muscle called a sphincter forms valves in the digestive system. The gastro-esophageal sphincter is located at the\n954\nChapter 34 \u2022 Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nstomach end of the esophagus. In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter opens,\nand the bolus enters the stomach. When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the\nstomach from traveling up the esophagus. Many animals have a true sphincter; however, in humans, there is no true sphincter,\nbut the esophagus remains closed when there is no swallowing action. Acid reflux or \u201cheartburn\u201d occurs when the acidic\ndigestive juices escape into the esophagus.\nStomach\nA large part of digestion occurs in the stomach, shown in Figure 34.11. The stomach is a saclike organ that secretes gastric\ndigestive juices. The pH in the stomach is between 1.5 and 2.5. This highly acidic environment is required for the chemical\nbreakdown of food and the extraction of nutrients. When empty, the stomach is a rather small organ; however, it can expand to\nup to 20 times its resting size when filled with food. This characteristic is particularly useful for animals that need to eat when\nfood is available.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 34.11 The human stomach has an extremely acidic environment where most of the protein gets digested. (credit: modification of\nwork by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nWhich of the following statements about the digestive system is false?\na.\nChyme is a mixture of food and digestive juices that is produced in the stomach.\nb.\nFood enters the large intestine before the small intestine.\nc.\nIn the small intestine, chyme mixes with bile, which emulsifies fats.\nd.\nThe stomach is separated from the small intestine by the pyloric sphincter.\n34.1 \u2022 Digestive Systems\n955\nThe stomach is also the major site for protein digestion in animals other than ruminants. Protein digestion is mediated by an\nenzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber. Pepsin is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form called\npepsinogen. Pepsin breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides; it also helps activate more pepsinogen,\nstarting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin. Another cell type\u2014parietal cells\u2014secrete hydrogen and\nchloride ions, which combine in the lumen to form hydrochloric acid, the primary acidic component of the stomach juices.\nHydrochloric acid helps to convert the inactive pepsinogen to pepsin. The highly acidic environment also kills many\nmicroorganisms in the food and, combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin, results in the hydrolysis of protein in the food.\nChemical digestion is facilitated by the churning action of the stomach. Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles mixes\nthe stomach contents about every 20 minutes. The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called chyme. Chyme\npasses from the stomach to the small intestine. Further protein digestion takes place in the small intestine. Gastric emptying\noccurs within two to six hours after a meal. Only a small amount of chyme is released into the small intestine at a time. The\nmovement of chyme from the stomach into the small intestine is regulated by the pyloric sphincter.\nWhen digesting protein and some fats, the stomach lining must be protected from getting digested by pepsin. There are two\npoints to consider when describing how the stomach lining is protected. First, as previously mentioned, the enzyme pepsin is\nsynthesized in the inactive form. This protects the chief cells, because pepsinogen does not have the same enzyme functionality\nof pepsin. Second, the stomach has a thick mucus lining that protects the underlying tissue from the action of the digestive\njuices. When this mucus lining is ruptured, ulcers can form in the stomach. Ulcers are open wounds in or on an organ caused by\nbacteria (Helicobacter pylori) when the mucus lining is ruptured and fails to reform.\nSmall Intestine\nChyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein, fats, and\ncarbohydrates is completed. The small intestine is a long tube-like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger-like\nprojections called the villi. The apical surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli. These structures,\nillustrated in Figure 34.12, are lined with epithelial cells on the luminal side and allow for the nutrients to be absorbed from the\ndigested food and absorbed into the bloodstream on the other side. The villi and microvilli, with their many folds, increase the\nsurface area of the intestine and increase absorption efficiency of the nutrients. Absorbed nutrients in the blood are carried into\nthe hepatic portal vein, which leads to the liver. There, the liver regulates the distribution of nutrients to the rest of the body and\nremoves toxic substances, including drugs, alcohol, and some pathogens.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 34.12 Villi are folds on the small intestine lining that increase the surface area to facilitate the absorption of nutrients.\nWhich of the following statements about the small intestine is false?\na.\nAbsorptive cells that line the small intestine have microvilli, small projections that increase surface area and aid in the\nabsorption of food.\nb.\nThe inside of the small intestine has many folds, called villi.\nc.\nMicrovilli are lined with blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels.\n956\nChapter 34 \u2022 Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nd.\nThe inside of the small intestine is called the lumen.\nThe human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The \u201cC-\nshaped,\u201d fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in Figure 34.11. The duodenum is separated from\nthe stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum. In the\nduodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of\nchyme and acts as a buffer. Pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver,\nand gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum. Bile is produced in the liver and\nstored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes\nthat catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. These digestive juices breakdown the food particles in the chyme into\nglucose, triglycerides, and amino acids. Some chemical digestion of food takes place in the duodenum. Absorption of fatty acids\nalso takes place in the duodenum.\nThe second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum, shown in Figure 34.11. Here, hydrolysis of nutrients is continued\nwhile most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining. The bulk of chemical digestion and\nnutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum.\nThe ileum, also illustrated in Figure 34.11 is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are absorbed\ninto the bloodstream. The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle. The\nileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve. The vermiform, \u201cworm-like,\u201d appendix is located at the ileocecal\nvalve. The appendix of humans secretes no enzymes and has an insignificant role in immunity.\nLarge Intestine\nThe large intestine, illustrated in Figure 34.13, reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste\nmaterial. The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter. It has\nthree parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch for the\nwaste matter. The colon is home to many bacteria or \u201cintestinal flora\u201d that aid in the digestive processes. The colon can be\ndivided into four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon. The main\nfunctions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material. Carnivorous\nmammals have a shorter large intestine compared to herbivorous mammals due to their diet.\nFigure 34.13 The large intestine reabsorbs water from undigested food and stores waste material until it is eliminated.\nRectum and Anus\nThe rectum is the terminal end of the large intestine, as shown in Figure 34.13. The primary role of the rectum is to store the\nfeces until defecation. The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination. The anus is an opening at the\nfar-end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material. Two sphincters between the rectum and anus control\nelimination: the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary.\nAccessory Organs\nThe organs discussed above are the organs of the digestive tract through which food passes. Accessory organs are organs that\nadd secretions (enzymes) that catabolize food into nutrients. Accessory organs include salivary glands, the liver, the pancreas,\n34.1 \u2022 Digestive Systems\n957\nand the gallbladder. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are regulated by hormones in response to the food consumed.\nThe liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays a very important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying blood. The\nliver produces bile, a digestive juice that is required for the breakdown of fatty components of the food in the duodenum. The\nliver also processes the vitamins and fats and synthesizes many plasma proteins.\nThe pancreas is another important gland that secretes digestive juices. The chyme produced from the stomach is highly acidic in\nnature; the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate, an alkali that neutralizes the acidic chyme. Additionally, the\npancreatic juices contain a large variety of enzymes that are required for the digestion of protein and carbohydrates.\nThe gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts. When chyme containing fatty\nacids enters the duodenum, the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum.\n34.2 Nutrition and Energy Production\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain why an animal\u2019s diet should be balanced and meet the needs of the body\n\u2022\nDefine the primary components of food\n\u2022\nDescribe the essential nutrients required for cellular function that cannot be synthesized by the animal body\n\u2022\nExplain how energy is produced through diet and digestion\n\u2022\nDescribe how excess carbohydrates and energy are stored in the body\nGiven the diversity of animal life on our planet, it is not surprising that the animal diet would also vary substantially. The animal\ndiet is the source of materials needed for building DNA and other complex molecules needed for growth, maintenance, and\nreproduction; collectively these processes are called biosynthesis. The diet is also the source of materials for ATP production in\nthe cells. The diet must be balanced to provide the minerals and vitamins that are required for cellular function.\nFood Requirements\nWhat are the fundamental requirements of the animal diet? The animal diet should be well balanced and provide nutrients\nrequired for bodily function and the minerals and vitamins required for maintaining structure and regulation necessary for\ngood health and reproductive capability. These requirements for a human are illustrated graphically in Figure 34.14\nFigure 34.14 For humans, a balanced diet includes fruits, vegetables, grains, and protein. (credit: USDA)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe first step in ensuring that you are meeting the food requirements of your body is an awareness of the food groups and the\n958\nChapter 34 \u2022 Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nnutrients they provide. To learn more about each food group and the recommended daily amounts, explore this interactive site\n(http://openstax.org/l/food_groups) by the United States Department of Agriculture.\nOrganic Precursors\nThe organic molecules required for building cellular material and tissues must come from food. Carbohydrates or sugars are the\nprimary source of organic carbons in the animal body. During digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately broken down\ninto glucose and used to provide energy through metabolic pathways. Complex carbohydrates, including polysaccharides, can be\nbroken down into glucose through biochemical modification; however, humans do not produce the enzyme cellulase and lack\nthe ability to derive glucose from the polysaccharide cellulose. In humans, these molecules provide the fiber required for moving\nwaste through the large intestine and a healthy colon. The intestinal flora in the human gut are able to extract some nutrition\nfrom these plant fibers. The excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles for later\nuse. Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance running, and to provide energy during food\nshortage. Excess glycogen can be converted to fats, which are stored in the lower layer of the skin of mammals for insulation and\nenergy storage. Excess digestible carbohydrates are stored by mammals in order to survive famine and aid in mobility.\nAnother important requirement is that of nitrogen. Protein catabolism provides a source of organic nitrogen. Amino acids are\nthe building blocks of proteins and protein breakdown provides amino acids that are used for cellular function. The carbon and\nnitrogen derived from these become the building block for nucleotides, nucleic acids, proteins, cells, and tissues. Excess\nnitrogen must be excreted as it is toxic. Fats add flavor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness. Fatty foods are also\nsignificant sources of energy because one gram of fat contains nine calories. Fats are required in the diet to aid the absorption of\nfat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones.\nEssential Nutrients\nWhile the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors, there are some\nnutrients that need to be consumed from food. These nutrients are termed essential nutrients, meaning they must be eaten,\nand the body cannot produce them.\nThe omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and the omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane\nphospholipids. Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many enzymes\nto function and, for this reason, are considered to be coenzymes. Absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on\nhealth, as outlined in Table 34.1 and Table 34.2. Both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins must be obtained from food.\nMinerals, listed in Table 34.3, are inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food. Among their many functions,\nminerals help in structure and regulation and are considered cofactors. Certain amino acids also must be procured from food\nand cannot be synthesized by the body. These amino acids are the \u201cessential\u201d amino acids. The human body can synthesize only\n11 of the 20 required amino acids; the rest must be obtained from food. The essential amino acids are listed in Table 34.4.\nEveryday Connection\nLet\u2019s Move! Campaign\nObesity is a growing epidemic and the rate of obesity among children is rapidly rising in the United States. To combat\nchildhood obesity and ensure that children get a healthy start in life, first lady Michelle Obama has launched the Let\u2019s Move!\ncampaign. The goal of this campaign is to educate parents and caregivers on providing healthy nutrition and encouraging\nactive lifestyles to future generations. This program aims to involve the entire community, including parents, teachers, and\nhealthcare providers to ensure that children have access to healthy foods\u2014more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains\u2014and\nconsume fewer calories from processed foods. Another goal is to ensure that children get physical activity. With the increase\nin television viewing and stationary pursuits such as video games, sedentary lifestyles have become the norm.

Homeostasis is the ability of a system to maintain a stable\ninternal environment even in the face of external changes to the environment. For example, the normal body temperature of\nhumans is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). Humans maintain this temperature even when the external temperature is hot or cold. It takes energy\nto maintain this body temperature, and animals obtain this energy from food.\nThe primary source of energy for animals is carbohydrates, mainly glucose. Glucose is called the body\u2019s fuel. The digestible\ncarbohydrates in an animal\u2019s diet are converted to glucose molecules through a series of catabolic chemical reactions.\nAdenosine triphosphate, or ATP, is the primary energy currency in cells; ATP stores energy in phosphate ester bonds. ATP\nreleases energy when the phosphodiester bonds are broken and ATP is converted to ADP and a phosphate group. ATP is\n34.2 \u2022 Nutrition and Energy Production\n963\nproduced by the oxidative reactions in the cytoplasm and mitochondrion of the cell, where carbohydrates, proteins, and fats\nundergo a series of metabolic reactions collectively called cellular respiration. For example, glycolysis is a series of reactions in\nwhich glucose is converted to pyruvic acid and some of its chemical potential energy is transferred to NADH and ATP.\nATP is required for all cellular functions. It is used to build the organic molecules that are required for cells and tissues; it\nprovides energy for muscle contraction and for the transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system. When the amount of\nATP is available in excess of the body\u2019s requirements, the liver uses the excess ATP and excess glucose to produce molecules\ncalled glycogen. Glycogen is a polymeric form of glucose and is stored in the liver and skeletal muscle cells. When blood sugar\ndrops, the liver releases glucose from stores of glycogen. Skeletal muscle converts glycogen to glucose during intense exercise.\nThe process of converting glucose and excess ATP to glycogen and the storage of excess energy is an evolutionarily important\nstep in helping animals deal with mobility, food shortages, and famine.\n34.3 Digestive System Processes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the process of digestion\n\u2022\nDetail the steps involved in digestion and absorption\n\u2022\nDefine elimination\n\u2022\nExplain the role of both the small and large intestines in absorption\nObtaining nutrition and energy from food is a multistep process. For true animals, the first step is ingestion, the act of taking in\nfood. This is followed by digestion, absorption, and elimination. In the following sections, each of these steps will be discussed\nin detail.\nIngestion\nThe large molecules found in intact food cannot pass through the cell membranes. Food needs to be broken into smaller particles\nso that animals can harness the nutrients and organic molecules. The first step in this process is ingestion. Ingestion is the\nprocess of taking in food through the mouth. In vertebrates, the teeth, saliva, and tongue play important roles in mastication\n(preparing the food into bolus). While the food is being mechanically broken down, the enzymes in saliva begin to chemically\nprocess the food as well. The combined action of these processes modifies the food from large particles to a soft mass that can be\nswallowed and can travel the length of the esophagus.\nEveryday Connection\nObesity\nObesity is a major health concern in the United States, and there is a growing focus on reducing obesity and the diseases it\nmay lead to, such as type-2 diabetes, cancers of the colon and breast, and cardiovascular disease. How does the food\nconsumed contribute to obesity?\nFatty foods are calorie-dense, meaning that they have more calories per unit mass than carbohydrates or proteins. One\ngram of carbohydrates has four calories, one gram of protein has four calories, and one gram of fat has nine calories.\nAnimals tend to seek lipid-rich food for their higher energy content.\nThe signals of hunger (\u201ctime to eat\u201d) and satiety (\u201ctime to stop eating\u201d) are controlled in the hypothalamus region of the\nbrain. Foods that are rich in fatty acids tend to promote satiety more than foods that are rich only in carbohydrates.\nExcess carbohydrate and ATP are used by the liver to synthesize glycogen. The pyruvate produced during glycolysis is used to\nsynthesize fatty acids. When there is more glucose in the body than required, the resulting excess pyruvate is converted into\nmolecules that eventually result in the synthesis of fatty acids within the body. These fatty acids are stored in adipose\ncells\u2014the fat cells in the mammalian body whose primary role is to store fat for later use.\nIt is important to note that some animals benefit from obesity. Polar bears and seals need body fat for insulation and to keep\nthem from losing body heat during Arctic winters. When food is scarce, stored body fat provides energy for maintaining\nhomeostasis. Fats prevent famine in mammals, allowing them to access energy when food is not available on a daily basis;\nfats are stored when a large kill is made or lots of food is available.\n964\nChapter 34 \u2022 Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nDigestion and Absorption\nDigestion is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into small organic fragments. It is important to breakdown\nmacromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium. Large, complex\nmolecules of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids must be reduced to simpler particles such as simple sugar before they can be\nabsorbed by the digestive epithelial cells. Different organs play specific roles in the digestive process. The animal diet needs\ncarbohydrates, protein, and fat, as well as vitamins and inorganic components for nutritional balance. How each of these\ncomponents is digested is discussed in the following sections.\nCarbohydrates\nThe digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth. The salivary enzyme amylase begins the breakdown of food starches into\nmaltose, a disaccharide. As the bolus of food travels through the esophagus to the stomach, no significant digestion of\ncarbohydrates takes place. The esophagus produces no digestive enzymes but does produce mucous for lubrication. The acidic\nenvironment in the stomach stops the action of the amylase enzyme.\nThe next step of carbohydrate digestion takes place in the duodenum. Recall that the chyme from the stomach enters the\nduodenum and mixes with the digestive secretion from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. Pancreatic juices also contain\namylase, which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose, a disaccharide. The disaccharides are broken\ndown into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases, sucrases, and lactases, which are also present in the brush border of\nthe small intestinal wall. Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose. Other disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose are broken\ndown by sucrase and lactase, respectively. Sucrase breaks down sucrose (or \u201ctable sugar\u201d) into glucose and fructose, and lactase\nbreaks down lactose (or \u201cmilk sugar\u201d) into glucose and galactose. The monosaccharides (glucose) thus produced are absorbed\nand then can be used in metabolic pathways to harness energy. The monosaccharides are transported across the intestinal\nepithelium into the bloodstream to be transported to the different cells in the body. The steps in carbohydrate digestion are\nsummarized in Figure 34.16 and Table 34.5.\nFigure 34.16 Digestion of carbohydrates is performed by several enzymes. Starch and glycogen are broken down into glucose by amylase\nand maltase. Sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (milk sugar) are broken down by sucrase and lactase, respectively.\nDigestion of Carbohydrates\nEnzyme\nProduced By\nSite of\nAction\nSubstrate\nActing On\nEnd Products\nSalivary amylase\nSalivary glands\nMouth\nPolysaccharides\n(Starch)\nDisaccharides (maltose),\noligosaccharides\nPancreatic amylase\nPancreas\nSmall\nintestine\nPolysaccharides\n(starch)\nDisaccharides (maltose),\nmonosaccharides\nOligosaccharidases\nLining of the intestine; brush\nborder membrane\nSmall\nintestine\nDisaccharides\nMonosaccharides (e.g., glucose,\nfructose, galactose)\nTable 34.5\n34.3 \u2022 Digestive System Processes\n965\nProtein\nA large part of protein digestion takes place in the stomach. The enzyme pepsin plays an important role in the digestion of\nproteins by breaking down the intact protein to peptides, which are short chains of four to nine amino acids. In the duodenum,\nother enzymes\u2014trypsin, elastase, and chymotrypsin\u2014act on the peptides reducing them to smaller peptides. Trypsin elastase,\ncarboxypeptidase, and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas and released into the duodenum where they act on the\nchyme. Further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases (those that breakdown\npeptides). Specifically, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase, and aminopeptidase play important roles in reducing the peptides to\nfree amino acids. The amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestines. The steps in protein\ndigestion are summarized in Figure 34.17 and Table 34.6.\nFigure 34.17 Protein digestion is a multistep process that begins in the stomach and continues through the intestines.\nDigestion of Protein\nEnzyme\nProduced By\nSite of Action\nSubstrate Acting On\nEnd Products\nPepsin\nStomach chief cells\nStomach\nProteins\nPeptides\nTrypsin\nElastase Chymotrypsin\nPancreas\nSmall intestine\nProteins\nPeptides\nTable 34.6\n966\nChapter 34 \u2022 Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nEnzyme\nProduced By\nSite of Action\nSubstrate Acting On\nEnd Products\nCarboxypeptidase\nPancreas\nSmall intestine\nPeptides\nAmino acids and peptides\nAminopeptidase\nDipeptidase\nLining of intestine\nSmall intestine\nPeptides\nAmino acids\nTable 34.6\nLipids\nLipid digestion begins in the stomach with the aid of lingual lipase and gastric lipase. However, the bulk of lipid digestion occurs\nin the small intestine due to pancreatic lipase. When chyme enters the duodenum, the hormonal responses trigger the release of\nbile, which is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile aids in the digestion of lipids, primarily triglycerides by\nemulsification. Emulsification is a process in which large lipid globules are broken down into several small lipid globules. These\nsmall globules are more widely distributed in the chyme rather than forming large aggregates. Lipids are hydrophobic\nsubstances: in the presence of water, they will aggregate to form globules to minimize exposure to water. Bile contains bile salts,\nwhich are amphipathic, meaning they contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Thus, the bile salts hydrophilic side can\ninterface with water on one side and the hydrophobic side interfaces with lipids on the other. By doing so, bile salts emulsify\nlarge lipid globules into small lipid globules.\nWhy is emulsification important for digestion of lipids? Pancreatic juices contain enzymes called lipases (enzymes that\nbreakdown lipids). If the lipid in the chyme aggregates into large globules, very little surface area of the lipids is available for the\nlipases to act on, leaving lipid digestion incomplete. By forming an emulsion, bile salts increase the available surface area of the\nlipids many fold. The pancreatic lipases can then act on the lipids more efficiently and digest them, as detailed in Figure 34.18.\nLipases breakdown the lipids into fatty acids and glycerides. These molecules can pass through the plasma membrane of the cell\nand enter the epithelial cells of the intestinal lining. The bile salts surround long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides forming\ntiny spheres called micelles. The micelles move into the brush border of the small intestine absorptive cells where the long-chain\nfatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse out of the micelles into the absorptive cells leaving the micelles behind in the chyme. The\nlong-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides, which aggregate into globules\nand become coated with proteins. These large spheres are called chylomicrons. Chylomicrons contain triglycerides, cholesterol,\nand other lipids and have proteins on their surface. The surface is also composed of the hydrophilic phosphate \"heads\" of\nphospholipids. Together, they enable the chylomicron to move in an aqueous environment without exposing the lipids to water.\nChylomicrons leave the absorptive cells via exocytosis. Chylomicrons enter the lymphatic vessels, and then enter the blood in the\nsubclavian vein.\n34.3 \u2022 Digestive System Processes\n967\nFigure 34.18 Lipids are digested and absorbed in the small intestine.\nVitamins\nVitamins can be either water-soluble or lipid-soluble. Fat soluble vitamins are absorbed in the same manner as lipids. It is\nimportant to consume some amount of dietary lipid to aid the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins. Water-soluble vitamins can\nbe directly absorbed into the bloodstream from the intestine.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis website (http://openstax.org/l/digest_enzymes) has an overview of the digestion of protein, fat, and carbohydrates.\n968\nChapter 34 \u2022 Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 34.19 Mechanical and chemical digestion of food takes place in many steps, beginning in the mouth and ending in the rectum.\nWhich of the following statements about digestive processes is true?\na.\nAmylase, maltase, and lactase in the mouth digest carbohydrates.\nb.\nTrypsin and lipase in the stomach digest protein.\nc.\nBile emulsifies lipids in the small intestine.\nd.\nNo food is absorbed until the small intestine.\nElimination\nThe final step in digestion is the elimination of undigested food content and waste products. The undigested food material\nenters the colon, where most of the water is reabsorbed. Recall that the colon is also home to the microflora called \u201cintestinal\nflora\u201d that aid in the digestion process. The semi-solid waste is moved through the colon by peristaltic movements of the muscle\nand is stored in the rectum. As the rectum expands in response to storage of fecal matter, it triggers the neural signals required\nto set up the urge to eliminate. The solid waste is eliminated through the anus using peristaltic movements of the rectum.\nCommon Problems with Elimination\nDiarrhea and constipation are some of the most common health concerns that affect digestion. Constipation is a condition\nwhere the feces are hardened because of excess water removal in the colon. In contrast, if enough water is not removed from the\nfeces, it results in diarrhea. Many bacteria, including the ones that cause cholera, affect the proteins involved in water\nreabsorption in the colon and result in excessive diarrhea.\n34.3 \u2022 Digestive System Processes\n969\nEmesis\nEmesis, or vomiting, is elimination of food by forceful expulsion through the mouth. It is often in response to an irritant that\naffects the digestive tract, including but not limited to viruses, bacteria, emotions, sights, and food poisoning. This forceful\nexpulsion of the food is due to the strong contractions produced by the stomach muscles. The process of emesis is regulated by\nthe medulla.\n34.4 Digestive System Regulation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of neural regulation in digestive processes\n\u2022\nExplain how hormones regulate digestion\nThe brain is the control center for the sensation of hunger and satiety. The functions of the digestive system are regulated\nthrough neural and hormonal responses.\nNeural Responses to Food\nIn reaction to the smell, sight, or thought of food, like that shown in Figure 34.20, the first response is that of salivation. The\nsalivary glands secrete more saliva in response to stimulation by the autonomic nervous system triggered by food in preparation\nfor digestion. Simultaneously, the stomach begins to produce hydrochloric acid to digest the food. Recall that the peristaltic\nmovements of the esophagus and other organs of the digestive tract are under the control of the brain. The brain prepares these\nmuscles for movement as well. When the stomach is full, the part of the brain that detects satiety signals fullness. There are\nthree overlapping phases of gastric control\u2014the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal phase\u2014each requires many\nenzymes and is under neural control as well.\nFigure 34.20 Seeing a plate of food triggers the secretion of saliva in the mouth and the production of HCL in the stomach. (credit: Kelly\nBailey)\nDigestive Phases\nThe response to food begins even before food enters the mouth. The first phase of ingestion, called the cephalic phase, is\ncontrolled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food. All aspects\u2014such as sight, sense, and smell\u2014trigger the\nneural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices. The gastric and salivary secretion in the cephalic phase\ncan also take place due to the thought of food. Right now, if you think about a piece of chocolate or a crispy potato chip, the\nincrease in salivation is a cephalic phase response to the thought. The central nervous system prepares the stomach to receive\nfood.\nThe gastric phase begins once the food arrives in the stomach. It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase.\nGastric acids and enzymes process the ingested materials. The gastric phase is stimulated by (1) distension of the stomach, (2) a\ndecrease in the pH of the gastric contents, and (3) the presence of undigested material. This phase consists of local, hormonal,\nand neural responses. These responses stimulate secretions and powerful contractions.\n970\nChapter 34 \u2022 Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions. This phase controls the rate\nof gastric emptying. In addition to gastrin emptying, when chyme enters the small intestine, it triggers other hormonal and\nneural events that coordinate the activities of the intestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder.\nHormonal Responses to Food\nThe endocrine system controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate\ntimes.\nOne of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment. During the gastric phase, the hormone\ngastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins. Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach\nacid, or hydrochloric acid (HCl) which aids in the digestion of the proteins. However, when the stomach is emptied, the acidic\nenvironment need not be maintained and a hormone called somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid. This is\ncontrolled by a negative feedback mechanism.\nIn the duodenum, digestive secretions from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme\nduring the intestinal phase. In order to neutralize the acidic chyme, a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to\nproduce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum. Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called\ncholecystokinin (CCK). Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices, it also stimulates\nthe gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/enteric_endo) to learn more about the endocrine system. Review the text and watch the\nanimation of how control is implemented in the endocrine system.\nAnother level of hormonal control occurs in response to the composition of food. Foods high in lipids take a long time to digest.\nA hormone called gastric inhibitory peptide is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic movements of the\nintestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed.\nUnderstanding the hormonal control of the digestive system is an important area of ongoing research. Scientists are exploring\nthe role of each hormone in the digestive process and developing ways to target these hormones. Advances could lead to\nknowledge that may help to battle the obesity epidemic.\n34.4 \u2022 Digestive System Regulation\n971\n", "key_terms": "\nalimentary canal\ntubular digestive system with a mouth\nand anus\naminopeptidase\nprotease that breaks down peptides to\nsingle amino acids; secreted by the brush border of small\nintestine\nanus\nexit point for waste material\nbile\ndigestive juice produced by the liver; important for\ndigestion of lipids\nbolus\nmass of food resulting from chewing action and\nwetting by saliva\ncarboxypeptidase\nprotease that breaks down peptides to\nsingle amino acids; secreted by the brush border of the\nsmall intestine\ncarnivore\nanimal that consumes animal flesh\ncephalic phase\nfirst phase of digestion, controlled by the\nneural response to the stimulus provided by food\ncholecystokinin\nhormone that stimulates the contraction\nof the gallbladder to release bile\nchylomicron\nsmall lipid globule\nchyme\nmixture of partially digested food and stomach\njuices\nchymotrypsin\npancreatic protease\ndigestion\nmechanical and chemical breakdown of food into\nsmall organic fragments\ndipeptidase\nprotease that breaks down peptides to single\namino acids; secreted by the brush border of small\nintestine\nduodenum\nfirst part of the small intestine where a large\npart of digestion of carbohydrates and fats occurs\nelastase\npancreatic protease\nendocrine system\nsystem that controls the response of the\nvarious glands in the body and the release of hormones at\nthe appropriate times\nesophagus\ntubular organ that connects the mouth to the\nstomach\nessential nutrient\nnutrient that cannot be synthesized by\nthe body; it must be obtained from food\ngallbladder\norgan that stores and concentrates bile\ngastric inhibitory peptide\nhormone secreted by the small\nintestine in the presence of fatty acids and sugars; it also\ninhibits acid production and peristalsis in order to slow\ndown the rate at which food enters the small intestine\ngastric phase\ndigestive phase beginning once food enters\nthe stomach; gastric acids and enzymes process the\ningested materials\ngastrin\nhormone which stimulates hydrochloric acid\nsecretion in the stomach\ngastrovascular cavity\ndigestive system consisting of a\nsingle opening\ngizzard\nmuscular organ that grinds food\nherbivore\nanimal that consumes a strictly plant diet\nileum\nlast part of the small intestine; connects the small\nintestine to the large intestine; important for absorption\nof B-12\ningestion\nact of taking in food\nintestinal phase\nthird digestive phase; begins when chyme\nenters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions\nand controlling the rate of gastric emptying\njejunum\nsecond part of the small intestine\nlactase\nenzyme that breaks down lactose into glucose and\ngalactose\nlarge intestine\ndigestive system organ that reabsorbs water\nfrom undigested material and processes waste matter\nlipase\nenzyme that chemically breaks down lipids\nliver\norgan that produces bile for digestion and processes\nvitamins and lipids\nmaltase\nenzyme that breaks down maltose into glucose\nmineral\ninorganic, elemental molecule that carries out\nimportant roles in the body\nmonogastric\ndigestive system that consists of a single-\nchambered stomach\nomnivore\nanimal that consumes both plants and animals\npancreas\ngland that secretes digestive juices\npepsin\nenzyme found in the stomach whose main role is\nprotein digestion\npepsinogen\ninactive form of pepsin\nperistalsis\nwave-like movements of muscle tissue\nproventriculus\nglandular part of a bird\u2019s stomach\nrectum\narea of the body where feces is stored until\nelimination\nroughage\ncomponent of food that is low in energy and high\nin fiber\nruminant\nanimal with a stomach divided into four\ncompartments\nsalivary amylase\nenzyme found in saliva, which converts\ncarbohydrates to maltose\nsecretin\nhormone which stimulates sodium bicarbonate\nsecretion in the small intestine\nsmall intestine\norgan where digestion of protein, fats, and\ncarbohydrates is completed\nsomatostatin\nhormone released to stop acid secretion\nwhen the stomach is empty\nsphincter\nband of muscle that controls movement of\nmaterials throughout the digestive tract\nstomach\nsaclike organ containing acidic digestive juices\nsucrase\nenzyme that breaks down sucrose into glucose and\nfructose\ntrypsin\npancreatic protease that breaks down protein\nvilli\nfolds on the inner surface of the small intestine whose\nrole is to increase absorption area\nvitamin\norganic substance necessary in small amounts to\nsustain life\n972\nChapter 34 \u2022 Key Terms\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n34.1 Digestive Systems\nDifferent animals have evolved different types of digestive\nsystems specialized to meet their dietary needs. Humans\nand many other animals have monogastric digestive systems\nwith a single-chambered stomach. Birds have evolved a\ndigestive system that includes a gizzard where the food is\ncrushed into smaller pieces. This compensates for their\ninability to masticate. Ruminants that consume large\namounts of plant material have a multi-chambered stomach\nthat digests roughage. Pseudo-ruminants have similar\ndigestive processes as ruminants but do not have the four-\ncompartment stomach. Processing food involves ingestion\n(eating), digestion (mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of\nlarge molecules), absorption (cellular uptake of nutrients),\nand elimination (removal of undigested waste as feces).\nMany organs work together to digest food and absorb\nnutrients. The mouth is the point of ingestion and the\nlocation where both mechanical and chemical breakdown of\nfood begins. Saliva contains an enzyme called amylase that\nbreaks down carbohydrates. The food bolus travels through\nthe esophagus by peristaltic movements to the stomach. The\nstomach has an extremely acidic environment. An enzyme\ncalled pepsin digests protein in the stomach. Further\ndigestion and absorption take place in the small intestine.\nThe large intestine reabsorbs water from the undigested food\nand stores waste until elimination.\n34.2 Nutrition and Energy\nProduction\nAnimal diet should be balanced and meet the needs of the\nbody. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are the primary\ncomponents of food. Some essential nutrients are required\nfor cellular function but cannot be produced by the animal\nbody. These include vitamins, minerals, some fatty acids,\nand some amino acids. Food intake in more than necessary\namounts is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells,\nand in fat cells. Excess adipose storage can lead to obesity\nand serious health problems. ATP is the energy currency of\nthe cell and is obtained from the metabolic pathways. Excess\ncarbohydrates and energy are stored as glycogen in the body.\n34.3 Digestive System Processes\nDigestion begins with ingestion, where the food is taken in\nthe mouth. Digestion and absorption take place in a series of\nsteps with special enzymes playing important roles in\ndigesting carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Elimination\ndescribes removal of undigested food contents and waste\nproducts from the body. While most absorption occurs in the\nsmall intestines, the large intestine is responsible for the\nfinal removal of water that remains after the absorptive\nprocess of the small intestines. The cells that line the large\nintestine absorb some vitamins as well as any leftover salts\nand water. The large intestine (colon) is also where feces is\nformed.\n34.4 Digestive System Regulation\nThe brain and the endocrine system control digestive\nprocesses. The brain controls the responses of hunger and\nsatiety. The endocrine system controls the release of\nhormones and enzymes required for digestion of food in the\ndigestive tract.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

A\nnervous system is an organism\u2019s control center: it processes sensory information from outside (and\ninside) the body and controls all behaviors\u2014from eating to sleeping to finding a mate.\nChapter Outline\n35.1 Neurons and Glial\nCells\n35.2 How Neurons\nCommunicate\n35.3 The Central\nNervous System\n35.4 The Peripheral\nNervous System\n35.5 Nervous System\nDisorders\nvariety of animals shown in Figure 35.2. Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system.\nOthers, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells\n(neurons) called a \u201cnerve net.\u201d Echinoderms such as sea stars have nerve cells that are bundled into fibers\ncalled nerves. Flatworms of the phylum Platyhelminthes have both a central nervous system (CNS), made up\nof a small \u201cbrain\u201d and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) containing a system of nerves\nthat extend throughout the body. The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly decentralized. It\ncontains a brain, ventral nerve cord, and ganglia (clusters of connected neurons). These ganglia can control\nmovements and behaviors without input from the brain. Octopi may have the most complicated of\ninvertebrate nervous systems\u2014they have neurons that are organized in specialized lobes and eyes that are\nstructurally similar to vertebrate species.\nFigure 35.2 Nervous systems vary in structure and complexity. In (a) cnidarians, nerve cells form a decentralized\nnerve net. In (b) echinoderms, nerve cells are bundled into fibers called nerves. In animals exhibiting bilateral\nsymmetry such as (c) planarians, neurons cluster into an anterior brain that processes information. In addition to a\nbrain, (d) arthropods have clusters of nerve cell bodies, called peripheral ganglia, located along the ventral nerve cord.\nMollusks such as squid and (e) octopi, which must hunt to survive, have complex brains containing millions of\nneurons. In (f) vertebrates, the brain and spinal cord comprise the central nervous system, while neurons extending\ninto the rest of the body comprise the peripheral nervous system. (credit e: modification of work by Michael\nVecchione, Clyde F.E. Roper, and Michael J. Sweeney, NOAA; credit f: modification of work by NIH)\nCompared to invertebrates, vertebrate nervous systems are more complex, centralized, and specialized.\nWhile there is great diversity among different vertebrate nervous systems, they all share a basic structure: a\nCNS that contains a brain and spinal cord and a PNS made up of peripheral sensory and motor nerves. One\ninteresting difference between the nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates is that the nerve cords\nof many invertebrates are located ventrally whereas the vertebrate spinal cords are located dorsally. There is\ndebate among evolutionary biologists as to whether these different nervous system plans evolved separately\n978\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nor whether the invertebrate body plan arrangement somehow \u201cflipped\u201d during the evolution of vertebrates.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video of biologist Mark Kirschner discussing the \u201cflipping\u201d phenomenon of vertebrate evolution.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/vertebrate_evol)\nThe nervous system is made up of neurons, specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals, and\nglia, cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to\nneurons. A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire\u2014it transmits a signal from one place to another. Glia can be compared\nto the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to the right places, maintain the wires, and take down wires that\nare broken. Although glia have been compared to workers, recent evidence suggests that they also usurp some of the signaling\nfunctions of neurons.\nThere is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in different parts of the nervous system. There are four\nmajor types of neurons, and they share several important cellular components.\nNeurons\nThe nervous system of the common laboratory fly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same\nnumber as a lobster. This number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the octopus. A human brain contains\naround 86 billion neurons. Despite these very different numbers, the nervous systems of these animals control many of the same\nbehaviors\u2014from basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like finding food and courting mates. The ability of neurons to\ncommunicate with each other as well as with other types of cells underlies all of these behaviors.\nMost neurons share the same cellular components. But neurons are also highly specialized\u2014different types of neurons have\ndifferent sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles.\nParts of a Neuron\nLike other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that contains a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi\napparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components. Neurons also contain unique structures, illustrated in Figure 35.3 for\nreceiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible. Dendrites are tree-like structures that\nextend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called synapses. Although some\nneurons do not have any dendrites, some types of neurons have multiple dendrites. Dendrites can have small protrusions called\ndendritic spines, which further increase surface area for possible synaptic connections.\nOnce a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels passively to the cell body. The cell body contains a specialized structure,\nthe axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon. An\naxon is a tube-like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals. These terminals\nin turn synapse on other neurons, muscle, or target organs. Chemicals released at axon terminals allow signals to be\ncommunicated to these other cells. Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like amacrine cells in the retina,\ndo not contain any axons. Some axons are covered with myelin, which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the\nelectrical signal as it travels down the axon, greatly increasing the speed of conduction. This insulation is important as the axon\nfrom a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter\u2014from the base of the spine to the toes. The myelin sheath is not actually\npart of the neuron. Myelin is produced by glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath. These gaps are\ncalled nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is \u201crecharged\u201d as it travels along the axon.\nIt is important to note that a single neuron does not act alone\u2014neuronal communication depends on the connections that\nneurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like muscle cells). Dendrites from a single neuron may receive\nsynaptic contact from many other neurons. For example, dendrites from a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive\ncontact from as many as 200,000 other neurons.\n35.1 \u2022 Neurons and Glial Cells\n979\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 35.3 Neurons contain organelles common to many other cells, such as a nucleus and mitochondria. They also have more specialized\nstructures, including dendrites and axons.\nWhich of the following statements is false?\na.\nThe soma is the cell body of a nerve cell.\nb.\nMyelin sheath provides an insulating layer to the dendrites.\nc.\nAxons carry the signal from the soma to the target.\nd.\nDendrites carry the signal to the soma.\nTypes of Neurons\nThere are different types of neurons, and the functional role of a given neuron is intimately dependent on its structure. There is\nan amazing diversity of neuron shapes and sizes found in different parts of the nervous system (and across species), as\nillustrated by the neurons shown in Figure 35.4.\n980\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 35.4 There is great diversity in the size and shape of neurons throughout the nervous system. Examples include (a) a pyramidal cell\nfrom the cerebral cortex, (b) a Purkinje cell from the cerebellar cortex, and (c) olfactory cells from the olfactory epithelium and olfactory\nbulb.\nWhile there are many defined neuron cell subtypes, neurons are broadly divided into four basic types: unipolar, bipolar,\nmultipolar, and pseudounipolar. Figure 35.5 illustrates these four basic neuron types. Unipolar neurons have only one structure\nthat extends away from the soma. These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate\nmuscles or glands. A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. An example of a bipolar neuron is\na retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to\nganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron. Each multipolar\nneuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system (brain and\nspinal cord). An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites but\nonly one axon. Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells. A pseudounipolar cell has a single\nprocess that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches into two distinct structures, like a\nbipolar cell. Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches into two extensions: one connected to\ndendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information to the spinal cord.\n35.1 \u2022 Neurons and Glial Cells\n981\nFigure 35.5 Neurons are broadly divided into four main types based on the number and placement of axons: (1) unipolar, (2) bipolar, (3)\nmultipolar, and (4) pseudounipolar.\nEveryday Connection\nNeurogenesis\nAt one time, scientists believed that people were born with all the neurons they would ever have. Research performed during\nthe last few decades indicates that neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, continues into adulthood. Neurogenesis was\nfirst discovered in songbirds that produce new neurons while learning songs. For mammals, new neurons also play an\nimportant role in learning: about 1000 new neurons develop in the hippocampus (a brain structure involved in learning and\nmemory) each day. While most of the new neurons will die, researchers found that an increase in the number of surviving\nnew neurons in the hippocampus correlated with how well rats learned a new task. Interestingly, both exercise and some\nantidepressant medications also promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Stress has the opposite effect. While\nneurogenesis is quite limited compared to regeneration in other tissues, research in this area may lead to new treatments\nfor disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s, stroke, and epilepsy.\nHow do scientists identify new neurons? A researcher can inject a compound called bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the\nbrain of an animal. While all cells will be exposed to BrdU, BrdU will only be incorporated into the DNA of newly generated\ncells that are in S phase. A technique called immunohistochemistry can be used to attach a fluorescent label to the\nincorporated BrdU, and a researcher can use fluorescent microscopy to visualize the presence of BrdU, and thus new\nneurons, in brain tissue. Figure 35.6 is a micrograph which shows fluorescently labeled neurons in the hippocampus of a rat.\n982\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis site (http://openstax.org/l/neurogenesis) contains more information about neurogenesis, including an interactive\nlaboratory simulation and a video that explains how BrdU labels new cells.\nGlia\nWhile glia are often thought of as the supporting cast of the nervous system, the number of glial cells in the brain actually\noutnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten. Neurons would be unable to function without the vital roles that are\nfulfilled by these glial cells. Glia guide developing neurons to their destinations, buffer ions and chemicals that would otherwise\nharm neurons, and provide myelin sheaths around axons. Scientists have recently discovered that they also play a role in\nresponding to nerve activity and modulating communication between nerve cells. When glia do not function properly, the result\ncan be disastrous\u2014most brain tumors are caused by mutations in glia.\nTypes of Glia\nThere are several different types of glia with different functions, two of which are shown in Figure 35.7. Astrocytes, shown in\nFigure 35.8a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS. They provide nutrients and other substances to\nneurons, regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid, and provide structural support for\nsynapses. Astrocytes also form the blood-brain barrier\u2014a structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the brain.\nAstrocytes, in particular, have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity,\ntransmit calcium waves between astrocytes, and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses. Satellite glia provide nutrients\nand structural support for neurons in the PNS. Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading\nmicroorganisms. Oligodendrocytes, shown in Figure 35.8b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS. One axon can be\nmyelinated by several oligodendrocytes, and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons. This is distinctive\nfrom the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon.\nRadial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations. Ependymal cells line fluid-filled\nventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. They are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid, which\nserves as a cushion for the brain, moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain, and is a component for the choroid\nplexus.\nFigure 35.6 This micrograph shows fluorescently labeled new neurons in a rat hippocampus. Cells that are actively dividing have\nbromodoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporated into their DNA and are labeled in red. Cells that express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) are\nlabeled in green. Astrocytes, but not neurons, express GFAP. Thus, cells that are labeled both red and green are actively dividing\nastrocytes, whereas cells labeled red only are actively dividing neurons.

While humans use words and body language to\ncommunicate, neurons use electrical and chemical signals. Just like a person in a committee, one neuron usually receives and\nsynthesizes messages from multiple other neurons before \u201cmaking the decision\u201d to send the message on to other neurons.\n984\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nNerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron\nFor the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because each\nneuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this\nmembrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To\nunderstand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or \u2018resting\u2019 membrane charge.\nNeuronal Charged Membranes\nThe lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the neuron,\nions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different\nconfigurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in Figure 35.9. Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open\nand allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape\naccordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels.\nVoltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The difference in\ntotal charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential.\nFigure 35.9 Voltage-gated ion channels open in response to changes in membrane voltage. After activation, they become inactivated for a\nbrief period and will no longer open in response to a signal.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis video discusses the basis of the resting membrane potential.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/resting_neuron)\nResting Membrane Potential\nA neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside (\u221270 mV,\nnote that this number varies by neuron type and by species). This voltage is called the resting membrane potential; it is caused by\ndifferences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions, each\ntype of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium. Because ions cannot simply cross the\nmembrane at will, there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell, as shown in Table 35.1. The\ndifference in the number of positively charged potassium ions (K+) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane\npotential (Figure 35.10). When the membrane is at rest, K+ ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net movement with the\nconcentration gradient. The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing the concentration of\ncations outside the cell (in the extracellular fluid) relative to inside the cell (in the cytoplasm). The negative charge within the cell\nis created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement. In neurons,\npotassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations\noutside of the cell. The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their\nconcentration gradient. However, the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels.\nTherefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in. Because more cations are leaving the cell\nthan are entering, this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell. The actions of the\nsodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential, once established. Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings\n35.2 \u2022 How Neurons Communicate\n985\ntwo K+ ions into the cell while removing three Na+ ions per ATP consumed. As more cations are expelled from the cell than taken\nin, the inside of the cell remains negatively charged relative to the extracellular fluid. It should be noted that chloride ions (Cl\u2013)\ntend to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm.\nIon Concentration Inside and Outside Neurons\nIon\nExtracellular concentration\n(mM)\nIntracellular concentration\n(mM)\nRatio outside/\ninside\nNa+\n145\n12\n12\nK+\n4\n155\n0.026\nCl\u2212\n120\n4\n30\nOrganic anions\n(A\u2212)\n\u2014\n100\nTable 35.1 The resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations inside and outside the cell.\n986\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 35.10 The (a) resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations of Na+ and K+ ions inside and outside the cell. A\nnerve impulse causes Na+ to enter the cell, resulting in (b) depolarization. At the peak action potential, K+ channels open and the cell\nbecomes (c) hyperpolarized.\nAction Potential\nA neuron can receive input from other neurons and, if this input is strong enough, send the signal to downstream neurons.\nTransmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter. Transmission of a signal\n35.2 \u2022 How Neurons Communicate\n987\nwithin a neuron (from dendrite to axon terminal) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action\npotential. When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron\u2019s dendrites, ion channels open. At excitatory\nsynapses, this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membrane\u2014a decrease in\nthe difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron. A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron\ndepolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential (-55 mV). Na+ channels in the axon hillock open, allowing positive ions to\nenter the cell (Figure 35.10 and Figure 35.11). Once the sodium channels open, the neuron completely depolarizes to a membrane\npotential of about +40 mV. Action potentials are considered an \"all-or nothing\" event, in that, once the threshold potential is\nreached, the neuron always completely depolarizes. Once depolarization is complete, the cell must now \"reset\" its membrane\nvoltage back to the resting potential. To accomplish this, the Na+ channels close and cannot be opened. This begins the neuron's\nrefractory period, in which it cannot produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open. At the same\ntime, voltage-gated K+ channels open, allowing K+ to leave the cell. As K+ ions leave the cell, the membrane potential once again\nbecomes negative. The diffusion of K+ out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell, in that the membrane potential becomes\nmore negative than the cell's normal resting potential. At this point, the sodium channels will return to their resting state,\nmeaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential. Eventually the extra K+\nions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium leakage channels, bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state, back to its\nresting membrane potential.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 35.11 The formation of an action potential can be divided into five steps: (1) A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron\ncauses the target cell to depolarize toward the threshold potential. (2) If the threshold of excitation is reached, all Na+ channels open and\nthe membrane depolarizes. (3) At the peak action potential, K+ channels open and K+ begins to leave the cell. At the same time, Na+\nchannels close. (4) The membrane becomes hyperpolarized as K+ ions continue to leave the cell. The hyperpolarized membrane is in a\nrefractory period and cannot fire. (5) The K+ channels close and the Na+/K+ transporter restores the resting potential.\nPotassium channel blockers, such as amiodarone and procainamide, which are used to treat abnormal electrical activity in the\nheart, called cardiac dysrhythmia, impede the movement of K+ through voltage-gated K+ channels. Which part of the action\npotential would you expect potassium channels to affect?\n988\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 35.12 The action potential is conducted down the axon as the axon membrane depolarizes, then repolarizes.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis video (http://openstax.org/l/actionpotential) presents an overview of action potential.\nMyelin and the Propagation of the Action Potential\nFor an action potential to communicate information to another neuron, it must travel along the axon and reach the axon\nterminals where it can initiate neurotransmitter release. The speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon is\ninfluenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon\u2019s resistance to current leak. Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents\ncurrent from leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential conduction. In demyelinating diseases like multiple\nsclerosis, action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas. The nodes of Ranvier,\nillustrated in Figure 35.13 are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon. These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer\nlong and contain voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels. Flow of ions through these channels, particularly the Na+ channels,\nregenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon. This \u2018jumping\u2019 of the action potential from one node to the\nnext is called saltatory conduction. If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon, the action potential would propagate\nvery slowly since Na+ and K+ channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon\ninstead of at specific points. Nodes of Ranvier also save energy for the neuron since the channels only need to be present at the\nnodes and not along the entire axon.\nFigure 35.13 Nodes of Ranvier are gaps in myelin coverage along axons. Nodes contain voltage-gated K+ and Na+ channels. Action\npotentials travel down the axon by jumping from one node to the next.\n35.2 \u2022 How Neurons Communicate\n989\nSynaptic Transmission\nThe synapse or \u201cgap\u201d is the place where information is transmitted from one neuron to another. Synapses usually form between\naxon terminals and dendritic spines, but this is not universally true. There are also axon-to-axon, dendrite-to-dendrite, and\naxon-to-cell body synapses. The neuron transmitting the signal is called the presynaptic neuron, and the neuron receiving the\nsignal is called the postsynaptic neuron. Note that these designations are relative to a particular synapse\u2014most neurons are\nboth presynaptic and postsynaptic. There are two types of synapses: chemical and electrical.\nChemical Synapse\nWhen an action potential reaches the axon terminal it depolarizes the membrane and opens voltage-gated Na+ channels. Na+\nions enter the cell, further depolarizing the presynaptic membrane. This depolarization causes voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to\nopen. Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes small membrane-bound vesicles, called synaptic\nvesicles, containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. Synaptic vesicles are shown in Figure\n35.14, which is an image from a scanning electron microscope.\nFigure 35.14 This pseudocolored image taken with a scanning electron microscope shows an axon terminal that was broken open to reveal\nsynaptic vesicles (blue and orange) inside the neuron. (credit: modification of work by Tina Carvalho, NIH-NIGMS; scale-bar data from Matt\nRussell)\nFusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft, the\nextracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, as illustrated in Figure 35.15. The neurotransmitter\ndiffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane.\n990\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 35.15 Communication at chemical synapses requires release of neurotransmitters. When the presynaptic membrane is depolarized,\nvoltage-gated Ca2+ channels open and allow Ca2+ to enter the cell. The calcium entry causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane\nand release neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to ligand-\ngated ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane, resulting in a localized depolarization or hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron.\nThe binding of a specific neurotransmitter causes particular ion channels, in this case ligand-gated channels, on the\npostsynaptic membrane to open. Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic\nmembrane, as detailed in Table 35.1. For example, when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between a nerve and muscle\n(called the neuromuscular junction) by a presynaptic neuron, it causes postsynaptic Na+ channels to open. Na+ enters the\npostsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize. This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic\n35.2 \u2022 How Neurons Communicate\n991\npotential (EPSP) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential. Release of neurotransmitter at\ninhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane. For\nexample, when the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released from a presynaptic neuron, it binds to and\nopens Cl- channels. Cl- ions enter the cell and hyperpolarizes the membrane, making the neuron less likely to fire an action\npotential.\nOnce neurotransmission has occurred, the neurotransmitter must be removed from the synaptic cleft so the postsynaptic\nmembrane can \u201creset\u201d and be ready to receive another signal. This can be accomplished in three ways: the neurotransmitter can\ndiffuse away from the synaptic cleft, it can be degraded by enzymes in the synaptic cleft, or it can be recycled (sometimes called\nreuptake) by the presynaptic neuron. Several drugs act at this step of neurotransmission. For example, some drugs that are\ngiven to Alzheimer\u2019s patients work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine. This inhibition of\nthe enzyme essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release acetylcholine. Once released, the acetylcholine\nstays in the cleft and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors.\nNeurotransmitter Function and Location\nNeurotransmitter\nExample\nLocation\nAcetylcholine\n\u2014\nCNS and/or PNS\nBiogenic amine\nDopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine\nCNS and/or PNS\nAmino acid\nGlycine, glutamate, aspartate, gamma aminobutyric acid\nCNS\nNeuropeptide\nSubstance P, endorphins\nCNS and/or PNS\nTable 35.2\nElectrical Synapse\nWhile electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical synapses, they are found in all nervous systems and play important\nand unique roles. The mode of neurotransmission in electrical synapses is quite different from that in chemical synapses. In an\nelectrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are very close together and are actually physically connected by\nchannel proteins forming gap junctions. Gap junctions allow current to pass directly from one cell to the next. In addition to the\nions that carry this current, other molecules, such as ATP, can diffuse through the large gap junction pores.\nThere are key differences between chemical and electrical synapses. Because chemical synapses depend on the release of\nneurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their signal, there is an approximately one millisecond delay\nbetween when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and when the neurotransmitter leads to opening of\npostsynaptic ion channels. Additionally, this signaling is unidirectional. Signaling in electrical synapses, in contrast, is virtually\ninstantaneous (which is important for synapses involved in key reflexes), and some electrical synapses are bidirectional.\nElectrical synapses are also more reliable as they are less likely to be blocked, and they are important for synchronizing the\nelectrical activity of a group of neurons. For example, electrical synapses in the thalamus are thought to regulate slow-wave\nsleep, and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures.\nSignal Summation\nSometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, but often multiple\npresynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an\naction potential. This process is called summation and occurs at the axon hillock, as illustrated in Figure 35.16. Additionally, one\nneuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons\u2014some excitatory and some inhibitory\u2014so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs\nand vice versa. It is the net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached\nits threshold of excitation needed to fire an action potential. Together, synaptic summation and the threshold for excitation act\nas a filter so that random \u201cnoise\u201d in the system is not transmitted as important information.\n992\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 35.16 A single neuron can receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from multiple neurons, resulting in local membrane\ndepolarization (EPSP input) and hyperpolarization (IPSP input). All these inputs are added together at the axon hillock. If the EPSPs are\nstrong enough to overcome the IPSPs and reach the threshold of excitation, the neuron will fire.\nEveryday Connection\nBrain-computer interface\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also called Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease) is a neurological disease characterized by the\ndegeneration of the motor neurons that control voluntary movements. The disease begins with muscle weakening and lack\nof coordination and eventually destroys the neurons that control speech, breathing, and swallowing; in the end, the disease\ncan lead to paralysis. At that point, patients require assistance from machines to be able to breathe and to communicate.\nSeveral special technologies have been developed to allow \u201clocked-in\u201d patients to communicate with the rest of the world.\nOne technology, for example, allows patients to type out sentences by twitching their cheek. These sentences can then be\nread aloud by a computer.\nA relatively new line of research for helping paralyzed patients, including those with ALS, to communicate and retain a\ndegree of self-sufficiency is called brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and is illustrated in Figure 35.17. This\ntechnology sounds like something out of science fiction: it allows paralyzed patients to control a computer using only their\nthoughts. There are several forms of BCI. Some forms use EEG recordings from electrodes taped onto the skull. These\nrecordings contain information from large populations of neurons that can be decoded by a computer. Other forms of BCI\nrequire the implantation of an array of electrodes smaller than a postage stamp in the arm and hand area of the motor\ncortex. This form of BCI, while more invasive, is very powerful as each electrode can record actual action potentials from one\nor more neurons. These signals are then sent to a computer, which has been trained to decode the signal and feed it to a\ntool\u2014such as a cursor on a computer screen. This means that a patient with ALS can use e-mail, read the Internet, and\ncommunicate with others by thinking of moving his or her hand or arm (even though the paralyzed patient cannot make\nthat bodily movement). Recent advances have allowed a paralyzed locked-in patient who suffered a stroke 15 years ago to\ncontrol a robotic arm and even to feed herself coffee using BCI technology.\nDespite the amazing advancements in BCI technology, it also has limitations. The technology can require many hours of\ntraining and long periods of intense concentration for the patient; it can also require brain surgery to implant the devices.\n35.2 \u2022 How Neurons Communicate\n993\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/paralyzation) in which a paralyzed woman uses a brain-controlled robotic arm to bring a\ndrink to her mouth, among other images of brain-computer interface technology in action.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/paralyzation)\nSynaptic Plasticity\nSynapses are not static structures. They can be weakened or strengthened. They can be broken, and new synapses can be made.\nSynaptic plasticity allows for these changes, which are all needed for a functioning nervous system. In fact, synaptic plasticity is\nthe basis of learning and memory. Two processes in particular, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD)\nare important forms of synaptic plasticity that occur in synapses in the hippocampus, a brain region that is involved in storing\nmemories.\nLong-term Potentiation (LTP)\nLong-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection. LTP is based on the Hebbian principle:\ncells that fire together wire together. There are various mechanisms, none fully understood, behind the synaptic strengthening\nseen with LTP. One known mechanism involves a type of postsynaptic glutamate receptor, called NMDA (N-Methyl-D-aspartate)\nreceptors, shown in Figure 35.18. These receptors are normally blocked by magnesium ions; however, when the postsynaptic\nneuron is depolarized by multiple presynaptic inputs in quick succession (either from one neuron or multiple neurons), the\nmagnesium ions are forced out allowing Ca ions to pass into the postsynaptic cell. Next, Ca2+ ions entering the cell initiate a\nsignaling cascade that causes a different type of glutamate receptor, called AMPA (\u03b1-\namino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors, to be inserted into the postsynaptic membrane, since\nactivated AMPA receptors allow positive ions to enter the cell. So, the next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic\nmembrane, it will have a larger excitatory effect (EPSP) on the postsynaptic cell because the binding of glutamate to these AMPA\nreceptors will allow more positive ions into the cell. The insertion of additional AMPA receptors strengthens the synapse and\nmeans that the postsynaptic neuron is more likely to fire in response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Some drugs of\nabuse co-opt the LTP pathway, and this synaptic strengthening can lead to addiction.\nFigure 35.17 With brain-computer interface technology, neural signals from a paralyzed patient are collected, decoded, and then fed\nto a tool, such as a computer, a wheelchair, or a robotic arm.\n994\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nLong-term Depression (LTD)\nLong-term depression (LTD) is essentially the reverse of LTP: it is a long-term weakening of a synaptic connection. One\nmechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors. In this situation, calcium that enters through NMDA receptors\ninitiates a different signaling cascade, which results in the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane, as\nillustrated in Figure 35.18. The decrease in AMPA receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to\nglutamate released from the presynaptic neuron. While it may seem counterintuitive, LTD may be just as important for learning\nand memory as LTP. The weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant connections to be lost and makes\nthe synapses that have undergone LTP that much stronger by comparison.\nFigure 35.18 Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors can initiate two different forms of synaptic plasticity: long-term\npotentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP arises when a single synapse is repeatedly stimulated. This stimulation causes a\ncalcium- and CaMKII-dependent cellular cascade, which results in the insertion of more AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane.\nThe next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic cell, it will bind to both NMDA and the newly inserted AMPA receptors, thus\ndepolarizing the membrane more efficiently. LTD occurs when few glutamate molecules bind to NMDA receptors at a synapse (due to a low\nfiring rate of the presynaptic neuron). The calcium that does flow through NMDA receptors initiates a different calcineurin and protein\nphosphatase 1-dependent cascade, which results in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors. This makes the postsynaptic neuron less\nresponsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron.\n35.3 The Central Nervous System\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nIdentify the spinal cord, cerebral lobes, and other brain areas on a diagram of the brain\n\u2022\nDescribe the basic functions of the spinal cord, cerebral lobes, and other brain areas\nThe central nervous system (CNS) is made up of the brain, a part of which is shown in Figure 35.19 and spinal cord and is covered\nwith three layers of protective coverings called meninges (from the Greek word for membrane). The outermost layer is the dura\n35.3 \u2022 The Central Nervous System\n995\nmater (Latin for \u201chard mother\u201d). As the Latin suggests, the primary function for this thick layer is to protect the brain and spinal\ncord. The dura mater also contains vein-like structures that carry blood from the brain back to the heart. The middle layer is the\nweb-like arachnoid mater. The last layer is the pia mater (Latin for \u201csoft mother\u201d), which directly contacts and covers the brain\nand spinal cord like plastic wrap. The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is\nproduced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid-filled compartments in the CNS called ventricles. The brain floats in CSF,\nwhich acts as a cushion and shock absorber and makes the brain neutrally buoyant. CSF also functions to circulate chemical\nsubstances throughout the brain and into the spinal cord.\nThe entire brain contains only about 8.5 tablespoons of CSF, but CSF is constantly produced in the ventricles. This creates a\nproblem when a ventricle is blocked\u2014the CSF builds up and creates swelling and the brain is pushed against the skull. This\nswelling condition is called hydrocephalus (\u201cwater head\u201d) and can cause seizures, cognitive problems, and even death if a shunt\nis not inserted to remove the fluid and pressure.\nFigure 35.19 The cerebral cortex is covered by three layers of meninges: the dura, arachnoid, and pia maters. (credit: modification of work\nby Gray\u2019s Anatomy)\nBrain\nThe brain is the part of the central nervous system that is contained in the cranial cavity of the skull. It includes the cerebral\ncortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. There are three different ways that a brain can be\nsectioned in order to view internal structures: a sagittal section cuts the brain left to right, as shown in Figure 35.21b, a coronal\nsection cuts the brain front to back, as shown in Figure 35.20a, and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to bottom.\nCerebral Cortex\nThe outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex, which is folded into hills\ncalled gyri (singular: gyrus) and valleys called sulci (singular: sulcus). The cortex is made up of two hemispheres\u2014right and\nleft\u2014which are separated by a large sulcus. A thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum (Latin: \u201ctough body\u201d) connects the\ntwo hemispheres and allows information to be passed from one side to the other. Although there are some brain functions that\nare localized more to one hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant. In fact,\nsometimes (very rarely) an entire hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy. While patients do suffer some deficits\nfollowing the surgery, they can have surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is performed on children who have\nvery immature nervous systems.\n996\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 35.20 These illustrations show the (a) coronal and (b) sagittal sections of the human brain.\nIn other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere. This causes a\ncondition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres. For example, when an object is\npresented to patients\u2019 left visual field, they may be unable to verbally name the object (and may claim to not have seen an object\nat all). This is because the visual input from the left visual field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then signal to\nthe speech center, which generally is found in the left side of the brain. Remarkably, if a split-brain patient is asked to pick up a\nspecific object out of a group of objects with the left hand, the patient will be able to do so but will still be unable to vocally\nidentify it.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSee this website (http://openstax.org/l/split-brain) to learn more about split-brain patients and to play a game where you can\nmodel the split-brain experiments yourself.\nEach cortical hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in different functions. Scientists use various techniques\nto determine what brain areas are involved in different functions: they examine patients who have had injuries or diseases that\naffect specific areas and see how those areas are related to functional deficits. They also conduct animal studies where they\nstimulate brain areas and see if there are any behavioral changes. They use a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation\n(TMS) to temporarily deactivate specific parts of the cortex using strong magnets placed outside the head; and they use\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at changes in oxygenated blood flow in particular brain regions that\ncorrelate with specific behavioral tasks. These techniques, and others, have given great insight into the functions of different\nbrain regions but have also showed that any given brain area can be involved in more than one behavior or process, and any\ngiven behavior or process generally involves neurons in multiple brain areas. That being said, each hemisphere of the\nmammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially defined lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal,\nand occipital. Figure 35.21 illustrates these four lobes of the human cerebral cortex.\nFigure 35.21 The human cerebral cortex includes the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.\n35.3 \u2022 The Central Nervous System\n997\nThe frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain, over the eyes. This lobe contains the olfactory bulb, which processes smells.\nThe frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex, which is important for planning and implementing movement. Areas within the\nmotor cortex map to different muscle groups, and there is some organization to this map, as shown in Figure 35.22. For\nexample, the neurons that control movement of the fingers are next to the neurons that control movement of the hand. Neurons\nin the frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining attention, speech, and decision-making. Studies of humans\nwho have damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are involved in personality, socialization, and assessing risk.\nFigure 35.22 Different parts of the motor cortex control different muscle groups. Muscle groups that are neighbors in the body are generally\ncontrolled by neighboring regions of the motor cortex as well. For example, the neurons that control finger movement are near the neurons\nthat control hand movement.\nThe parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain. Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading. Two of\nthe parietal lobe\u2019s main functions are processing somatosensation\u2014touch sensations like pressure, pain, heat, cold\u2014and\nprocessing proprioception\u2014the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space. The parietal lobe contains a\nsomatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex.\nThe occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain. It is primarily involved in vision\u2014seeing, recognizing, and identifying the\nvisual world.\nThe temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting\nsounds. It also contains the hippocampus (Greek for \u201cseahorse\u201d)\u2014a structure that processes memory formation. The\nhippocampus is illustrated in Figure 35.24. The role of the hippocampus in memory was partially determined by studying one\nfamous epileptic patient, HM, who had both sides of his hippocampus removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His seizures\nwent away, but he could no longer form new memories (although he could remember some facts from before his surgery and\ncould learn new motor tasks).\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nCerebral Cortex\nCompared to other vertebrates, mammals have exceptionally large brains for their body size. An entire alligator\u2019s brain, for\nexample, would fill about one and a half teaspoons. This increase in brain to body size ratio is especially pronounced in apes,\nwhales, and dolphins. While this increase in overall brain size doubtlessly played a role in the evolution of complex behaviors\nunique to mammals, it does not tell the whole story. Scientists have found a relationship between the relatively high surface area\nof the cortex and the intelligence and complex social behaviors exhibited by some mammals. This increased surface area is due,\nin part, to increased folding of the cortical sheet (more sulci and gyri). For example, a rat cortex is very smooth with very few\nsulci and gyri. Cat and sheep cortices have more sulci and gyri. Chimps, humans, and dolphins have even more.\n998\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 35.23 Mammals have larger brain-to-body ratios than other vertebrates. Within mammals, increased cortical folding and surface\narea is correlated with complex behavior.\nBasal Ganglia\nInterconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia (or basal nuclei), shown in Figure 35.20b, play important roles in movement\ncontrol and posture. Damage to the basal ganglia, as in Parkinson\u2019s disease, leads to motor impairments like a shuffling gait\nwhen walking. The basal ganglia also regulate motivation. For example, when a wasp sting led to bilateral basal ganglia damage\nin a 25-year-old businessman, he began to spend all his days in bed and showed no interest in anything or anybody. But when he\nwas externally stimulated\u2014as when someone asked to play a card game with him\u2014he was able to function normally.\nInterestingly, he and other similar patients do not report feeling bored or frustrated by their state.\nThalamus\nThe thalamus (Greek for \u201cinner chamber\u201d), illustrated in Figure 35.24, acts as a gateway to and from the cortex. It receives\nsensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback mechanism can modulate\nconscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the attention and arousal state of the animal. The thalamus\nhelps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states. A rare genetic disorder called fatal familial insomnia causes the\ndegeneration of thalamic neurons and glia. This disorder prevents affected patients from being able to sleep, among other\nsymptoms, and is eventually fatal.\n35.3 \u2022 The Central Nervous System\n999\nFigure 35.24 The limbic system regulates emotion and other behaviors. It includes parts of the cerebral cortex located near the center of\nthe brain, including the cingulate gyrus and the hippocampus as well as the thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala.\nHypothalamus\nBelow the thalamus is the hypothalamus, shown in Figure 35.24. The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending\nsignals to the pituitary gland, a pea-sized endocrine gland that releases several different hormones that affect other glands as\nwell as other cells. This relationship means that the hypothalamus regulates important behaviors that are controlled by these\nhormones. The hypothalamus is the body\u2019s thermostat\u2014it makes sure key functions like food and water intake, energy\nexpenditure, and body temperature are kept at appropriate levels. Neurons within the hypothalamus also regulate circadian\nrhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles.\nLimbic System\nThe limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation. It\nplays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus. One\nimportant structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala (Greek for \u201calmond\u201d), illustrated\nin Figure 35.24. The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces. The cingulate\ngyrus helps regulate emotions and pain.\nCerebellum\nThe cerebellum (Latin for \u201clittle brain\u201d), shown in Figure 35.21, sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem. The\ncerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks.\nBrainstem\nThe brainstem, illustrated in Figure 35.21, connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord. It consists of the midbrain,\nmedulla oblongata, and the pons. Motor and sensory neurons extend through the brainstem allowing for the relay of signals\nbetween the brain and spinal cord. Ascending neural pathways cross in this section of the brain allowing the left hemisphere of\nthe cerebrum to control the right side of the body and vice versa. The brainstem coordinates motor control signals sent from the\nbrain to the body. The brainstem controls several important functions of the body including alertness, arousal, breathing, blood\npressure, digestion, heart rate, swallowing, walking, and sensory and motor information integration.\nSpinal Cord\nConnecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord, shown in Figure 35.21.\nThe spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the\nbody. The spinal cord is contained within the bones of the vertebrate column but is able to communicate signals to and from the\n1000\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nbody through its connections with spinal nerves (part of the peripheral nervous system). A cross-section of the spinal cord looks\nlike a white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape, as illustrated in Figure 35.25. Myelinated axons make up the \u201cwhite matter\u201d\nand neuron and glial cell bodies make up the \u201cgray matter.\u201d Gray matter is also composed of interneurons, which connect two\nneurons each located in different parts of the body. Axons and cell bodies in the dorsal (facing the back of the animal) spinal cord\nconvey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain. Axons and cell bodies in the ventral (facing the front of the\nanimal) spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the body.\nThe spinal cord also controls motor reflexes. These reflexes are quick, unconscious movements\u2014like automatically removing a\nhand from a hot object. Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections. For example, the knee reflex that a\ndoctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron. While a\nreflex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit\ninformation to the brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was hot).\nIn the United States, there around 10,000 spinal cord injuries each year. Because the spinal cord is the information\nsuperhighway connecting the brain with the body, damage to the spinal cord can lead to paralysis. The extent of the paralysis\ndepends on the location of the injury along the spinal cord and whether the spinal cord was completely severed. For example, if\nthe spinal cord is damaged at the level of the neck, it can cause paralysis from the neck down, whereas damage to the spinal\ncolumn further down may limit paralysis to the legs. Spinal cord injuries are notoriously difficult to treat because spinal nerves\ndo not regenerate, although ongoing research suggests that stem cell transplants may be able to act as a bridge to reconnect\nsevered nerves. Researchers are also looking at ways to prevent the inflammation that worsens nerve damage after injury. One\nsuch treatment is to pump the body with cold saline to induce hypothermia. This cooling can prevent swelling and other\nprocesses that are thought to worsen spinal cord injuries.\nFigure 35.25 A cross-section of the spinal cord shows gray matter (containing cell bodies and interneurons) and white matter (containing\naxons).\n35.4 The Peripheral Nervous System\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the organization and functions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems\n\u2022\nDescribe the organization and function of the sensory-somatic nervous system\nThe peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the connection between the central nervous system and the rest of the body. The CNS is\nlike the power plant of the nervous system. It creates the signals that control the functions of the body. The PNS is like the wires\nthat go to individual houses. Without those \u201cwires,\u201d the signals produced by the CNS could not control the body (and the CNS\nwould not be able to receive sensory information from the body either).\nThe PNS can be broken down into the autonomic nervous system, which controls bodily functions without conscious control,\nand the sensory-somatic nervous system, which transmits sensory information from the skin, muscles, and sensory organs to\nthe CNS and sends motor commands from the CNS to the muscles.\n35.4 \u2022 The Peripheral Nervous System\n1001\nAutonomic Nervous System\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 35.26 In the autonomic nervous system, a preganglionic neuron of the CNS synapses with a postganglionic neuron of the PNS. The\npostganglionic neuron, in turn, acts on a target organ. Autonomic responses are mediated by the sympathetic and the parasympathetic\nsystems, which are antagonistic to one another. The sympathetic system activates the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, while the parasympathetic\nsystem activates the \u201crest and digest\u201d response.\nWhich of the following statements is false?\na.\nThe parasympathetic pathway is responsible for resting the body, while the sympathetic pathway is responsible for\npreparing for an emergency.\nb.\nMost preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic pathway originate in the spinal cord.\nc.\nSlowing of the heartbeat is a parasympathetic response.\nd.\nParasympathetic neurons are responsible for releasing norepinephrine on the target organ, while sympathetic neurons are\nresponsible for releasing acetylcholine.\nThe autonomic nervous system serves as the relay between the CNS and the internal organs. It controls the lungs, the heart,\n1002\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nsmooth muscle, and exocrine and endocrine glands. The autonomic nervous system controls these organs largely without\nconscious control; it can continuously monitor the conditions of these different systems and implement changes as needed.\nSignaling to the target tissue usually involves two synapses: a preganglionic neuron (originating in the CNS) synapses to a\nneuron in a ganglion that, in turn, synapses on the target organ, as illustrated in Figure 35.26. There are two divisions of the\nautonomic nervous system that often have opposing effects: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem.\nSympathetic Nervous System\nThe sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response that occurs when an animal encounters a\ndangerous situation. One way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a snake (\u201csnake\u201d\nand \u201csympathetic\u201d both begin with \u201cs\u201d). Examples of functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system include an\naccelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion. These functions help prepare an organism\u2019s body for the physical strain required\nto escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend off a predator.\nFigure 35.27 The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems often have opposing effects on target organs.\nMost preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord, as illustrated in Figure 35.27. The\naxons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia (the sympathetic ganglia\nform a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord). The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons. Postganglionic\n35.4 \u2022 The Peripheral Nervous System\n1003\nneurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs. As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test, speech, or athletic\nevent can attest, the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive. This is both because one preganglionic\nneuron synapses on multiple postganglionic neurons, amplifying the effect of the original synapse, and because the adrenal\ngland also releases norepinephrine (and the closely related hormone epinephrine) into the bloodstream. The physiological\neffects of this norepinephrine release include dilating the trachea and bronchi (making it easier for the animal to breathe),\nincreasing heart rate, and moving blood from the skin to the heart, muscles, and brain (so the animal can think and run). The\nstrength and speed of the sympathetic response helps an organism avoid danger, and scientists have found evidence that it may\nalso increase LTP\u2014allowing the animal to remember the dangerous situation and avoid it in the future.\nParasympathetic Nervous System\nWhile the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations, the parasympathetic nervous system allows an\nanimal to \u201crest and digest.\u201d One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic, the\nparasympathetic nervous system is in control (\u201cpicnic\u201d and \u201cparasympathetic\u201d both start with \u201cp\u201d). Parasympathetic\npreganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral (toward the bottom) spinal cord, as shown in\nFigure 35.27. The axons of the preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine on the postganglionic neurons, which are generally\nlocated very near the target organs. Most postganglionic neurons release acetylcholine onto target organs, although some\nrelease nitric oxide.\nThe parasympathetic nervous system resets organ function after the sympathetic nervous system is activated (the common\nadrenaline dump you feel after a \u2018fight-or-flight\u2019 event). Effects of acetylcholine release on target organs include slowing of heart\nrate, lowered blood pressure, and stimulation of digestion.\nSensory-Somatic Nervous System\nThe sensory-somatic nervous system is made up of cranial and spinal nerves and contains both sensory and motor neurons.\nSensory neurons transmit sensory information from the skin, skeletal muscle, and sensory organs to the CNS. Motor neurons\ntransmit messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles to make them contract. Without its sensory-somatic\nnervous system, an animal would be unable to process any information about its environment (what it sees, feels, hears, and so\non) and could not control motor movements. Unlike the autonomic nervous system, which has two synapses between the CNS\nand the target organ, sensory and motor neurons have only one synapse\u2014one ending of the neuron is at the organ and the other\ndirectly contacts a CNS neuron. Acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter released at these synapses.\nHumans have 12 cranial nerves, nerves that emerge from or enter the skull (cranium), as opposed to the spinal nerves, which\nemerge from the vertebral column. Each cranial nerve is accorded a name, which are detailed in Figure 35.28. Some cranial\nnerves transmit only sensory information. For example, the olfactory nerve transmits information about smells from the nose to\nthe brainstem. Other cranial nerves transmit almost solely motor information. For example, the oculomotor nerve controls the\nopening and closing of the eyelid and some eye movements. Other cranial nerves contain a mix of sensory and motor fibers. For\nexample, the glossopharyngeal nerve has a role in both taste (sensory) and swallowing (motor).\n1004\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 35.28 The human brain contains 12 cranial nerves that receive sensory input and control motor output for the head and neck.\nSpinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body. Each of the 31 spinal\nnerves (in humans) contains both sensory and motor axons. The sensory neuron cell bodies are grouped in structures called\ndorsal root ganglia and are shown in Figure 35.29. Each sensory neuron has one projection\u2014with a sensory receptor ending in\nskin, muscle, or sensory organs\u2014and another that synapses with a neuron in the dorsal spinal cord. Motor neurons have cell\nbodies in the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord that project to muscle through the ventral root. These neurons are usually\nstimulated by interneurons within the spinal cord but are sometimes directly stimulated by sensory neurons.\nFigure 35.29 Spinal nerves contain both sensory and motor axons. The somas of sensory neurons are located in dorsal root ganglia. The\nsomas of motor neurons are found in the ventral portion of the gray matter of the spinal cord.\n35.5 Nervous System Disorders\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the symptoms, potential causes, and treatment of several examples of nervous system disorders\nA nervous system that functions correctly is a fantastically complex, well-oiled machine\u2014synapses fire appropriately, muscles\n35.5 \u2022 Nervous System Disorders\n1005\nmove when needed, memories are formed and stored, and emotions are well regulated. Unfortunately, each year millions of\npeople in the United States deal with some sort of nervous system disorder. While scientists have discovered potential causes of\nmany of these diseases, and viable treatments for some, ongoing research seeks to find ways to better prevent and treat all of\nthese disorders.\nNeurodegenerative Disorders\nNeurodegenerative disorders are illnesses characterized by a loss of nervous system functioning that are usually caused by\nneuronal death. These diseases generally worsen over time as more and more neurons die. The symptoms of a particular\nneurodegenerative disease are related to where in the nervous system the death of neurons occurs. Spinocerebellar ataxia, for\nexample, leads to neuronal death in the cerebellum. The death of these neurons causes problems in balance and walking.\nNeurodegenerative disorders include Huntington\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other types of\ndementia disorders, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Here, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease will be discussed in more depth.\nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. In 2012, an estimated 5.4 million Americans suffered\nfrom Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and payments for their care are estimated at $200 billion. Roughly one in every eight people age 65 or\nolder has the disease. Due to the aging of the baby-boomer generation, there are projected to be as many as 13 million\nAlzheimer\u2019s patients in the United States in the year 2050.\nSymptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease include disruptive memory loss, confusion about time or place, difficulty planning or\nexecuting tasks, poor judgment, and personality changes. Problems smelling certain scents can also be indicative of Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease and may serve as an early warning sign. Many of these symptoms are also common in people who are aging normally, so\nit is the severity and longevity of the symptoms that determine whether a person is suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s.\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease was named for Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist who published a report in 1911 about a woman who\nshowed severe dementia symptoms. Along with his colleagues, he examined the woman\u2019s brain following her death and reported\nthe presence of abnormal clumps, which are now called amyloid plaques, along with tangled brain fibers called neurofibrillary\ntangles. Amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and an overall shrinking of brain volume are commonly seen in the brains of\nAlzheimer\u2019s patients. Loss of neurons in the hippocampus is especially severe in advanced Alzheimer\u2019s patients. Figure 35.30\ncompares a normal brain to the brain of an Alzheimer\u2019s patient. Many research groups are examining the causes of these\nhallmarks of the disease.\nOne form of the disease is usually caused by mutations in one of three known genes. This rare form of early onset Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease affects fewer than five percent of patients with the disease and causes dementia beginning between the ages of 30 and\n60. The more prevalent, late-onset form of the disease likely also has a genetic component. One particular gene, apolipoprotein\nE (APOE) has a variant (E4) that increases a carrier\u2019s likelihood of getting the disease. Many other genes have been identified\nthat might be involved in the pathology.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/alzheimers) for video links discussing genetics and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Current treatments focus on managing the symptoms of the disease.\nBecause decrease in the activity of cholinergic neurons (neurons that use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine) is common in\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, several drugs used to treat the disease work by increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission, often by\ninhibiting the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. Other clinical interventions focus on behavioral\ntherapies like psychotherapy, sensory therapy, and cognitive exercises. Since Alzheimer\u2019s disease appears to hijack the normal\naging process, research into prevention is prevalent. Smoking, obesity, and cardiovascular problems may be risk factors for the\ndisease, so treatments for those may also help to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Some studies have shown that people who remain\nintellectually active by playing games, reading, playing musical instruments, and being socially active in later life have a reduced\nrisk of developing the disease.\n1006\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 35.30 Compared to a normal brain (left), the brain from a patient with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (right) shows a dramatic\nneurodegeneration, particularly within the ventricles and hippocampus.

It was first characterized by James Parkinson in\n1817. Each year, 50,000-60,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease. Parkinson\u2019s disease causes the loss of\ndopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, a midbrain structure that regulates movement. Loss of these neurons causes many\nsymptoms including tremor (shaking of fingers or a limb), slowed movement, speech changes, balance and posture problems,\nand rigid muscles. The combination of these symptoms often causes a characteristic slow hunched shuffling walk, illustrated in\nFigure 35.31. Patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease can also exhibit psychological symptoms, such as dementia or emotional\nproblems.\nAlthough some patients have a form of the disease known to be caused by a single mutation, for most patients the exact causes\nof Parkinson\u2019s disease remain unknown: the disease likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors\n(similar to Alzheimer\u2019s disease). Post-mortem analysis of brains from Parkinson\u2019s patients shows the presence of Lewy\nbodies\u2014abnormal protein clumps\u2014in dopaminergic neurons. The prevalence of these Lewy bodies often correlates with the\nseverity of the disease.\nThere is no cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease, and treatment is focused on easing symptoms. One of the most commonly prescribed\ndrugs for Parkinson\u2019s is L-DOPA, which is a chemical that is converted into dopamine by neurons in the brain. This conversion\nincreases the overall level of dopamine neurotransmission and can help compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the\nsubstantia nigra. Other drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down dopamine.\n35.5 \u2022 Nervous System Disorders\n1007\nFigure 35.31 Parkinson\u2019s patients often have a characteristic hunched walk.\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\nNeurodevelopmental disorders occur when the development of the nervous system is disturbed. There are several different\nclasses of neurodevelopmental disorders. Some, like Down Syndrome, cause intellectual deficits. Others specifically affect\ncommunication, learning, or the motor system. Some disorders like autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder have complex symptoms.\nAutism\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder. Its severity differs from person to person. Estimates for the\nprevalence of the disorder have changed rapidly in the past few decades. Current estimates suggest that one in 88 children will\ndevelop the disorder. ASD is four times more prevalent in males than females.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis video (http://openstax.org/l/autism) discusses possible reasons why there has been a recent increase in the number of\npeople diagnosed with autism.\nA characteristic symptom of ASD is impaired social skills. Children with autism may have difficulty making and maintaining eye\ncontact and reading social cues. They also may have problems feeling empathy for others. Other symptoms of ASD include\nrepetitive motor behaviors (such as rocking back and forth), preoccupation with specific subjects, strict adherence to certain\nrituals, and unusual language use. Up to 30 percent of patients with ASD develop epilepsy, and patients with some forms of the\ndisorder (like Fragile X) also have intellectual disability. Because it is a spectrum disorder, other ASD patients are very functional\nand have good-to-excellent language skills. Many of these patients do not feel that they suffer from a disorder and instead think\n1008\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthat their brains just process information differently.\nExcept for some well-characterized, clearly genetic forms of autism (like Fragile X and Rett\u2019s Syndrome), the causes of ASD are\nlargely unknown. Variants of several genes correlate with the presence of ASD, but for any given patient, many different\nmutations in different genes may be required for the disease to develop. At a general level, ASD is thought to be a disease of\n\u201cincorrect\u201d wiring. Accordingly, brains of some ASD patients lack the same level of synaptic pruning that occurs in non-affected\npeople. In the 1990s, a research paper linked autism to a common vaccine given to children. This paper was retracted when it\nwas discovered that the author falsified data, and follow-up studies showed no connection between vaccines and autism.\nTreatment for autism usually combines behavioral therapies and interventions, along with medications to treat other disorders\ncommon to people with autism (depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder). Although early interventions can help\nmitigate the effects of the disease, there is currently no cure for ASD.\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\nApproximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected by attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Like\nASD, ADHD is more prevalent in males than females. Symptoms of the disorder include inattention (lack of focus), executive\nfunctioning difficulties, impulsivity, and hyperactivity beyond what is characteristic of the normal developmental stage. Some\npatients do not have the hyperactive component of symptoms and are diagnosed with a subtype of ADHD: attention deficit\ndisorder (ADD). Many people with ADHD also show comorbitity, in that they develop secondary disorders in addition to ADHD.\nExamples include depression or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Figure 35.32 provides some statistics concerning\ncomorbidity with ADHD.\nThe cause of ADHD is unknown, although research points to a delay and dysfunction in the development of the prefrontal cortex\nand disturbances in neurotransmission. According to studies of twins, the disorder has a strong genetic component. There are\nseveral candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder, but no definitive links have been discovered. Environmental factors,\nincluding exposure to certain pesticides, may also contribute to the development of ADHD in some patients. Treatment for\nADHD often involves behavioral therapies and the prescription of stimulant medications, which paradoxically cause a calming\neffect in these patients.\nFigure 35.32 Many people with ADHD have one or more other neurological disorders. (credit \u201cchart design and illustration\u201d: modification of\nwork by Leigh Coriale; credit \u201cdata\u201d: Drs. Biederman and Faraone, Massachusetts General Hospital).\nCAREER CONNECTION\nNeurologist\nNeurologists are physicians who specialize in disorders of the nervous system. They diagnose and treat disorders such as\nepilepsy, stroke, dementia, nervous system injuries, Parkinson\u2019s disease, sleep disorders, and multiple sclerosis. Neurologists\nare medical doctors who have attended college, medical school, and completed three to four years of neurology residency.\nWhen examining a new patient, a neurologist takes a full medical history and performs a complete physical exam. The physical\nexam contains specific tasks that are used to determine what areas of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system may\nbe damaged. For example, to check whether the hypoglossal nerve is functioning correctly, the neurologist will ask the patient to\nmove his or her tongue in different ways. If the patient does not have full control over tongue movements, then the hypoglossal\n35.5 \u2022 Nervous System Disorders\n1009\nnerve may be damaged or there may be a lesion in the brainstem where the cell bodies of these neurons reside (or there could be\ndamage to the tongue muscle itself).\nNeurologists have other tools besides a physical exam they can use to diagnose particular problems in the nervous system. If the\npatient has had a seizure, for example, the neurologist can use electroencephalography (EEG), which involves taping electrodes\nto the scalp to record brain activity, to try to determine which brain regions are involved in the seizure. In suspected stroke\npatients, a neurologist can use a computerized tomography (CT) scan, which is a type of X-ray, to look for bleeding in the brain\nor a possible brain tumor. To treat patients with neurological problems, neurologists can prescribe medications or refer the\npatient to a neurosurgeon for surgery.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis website (http://openstax.org/l/neurologic_exam) allows you to see the different tests a neurologist might use to see what\nregions of the nervous system may be damaged in a patient.\nMental Illnesses\nMental illnesses are nervous system disorders that result in problems with thinking, mood, or relating with other people. These\ndisorders are severe enough to affect a person\u2019s quality of life and often make it difficult for people to perform the routine tasks\nof daily living. Debilitating mental disorders plague approximately 12.5 million Americans (about 1 in 17 people) at an annual\ncost of more than $300 billion. There are several types of mental disorders including schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar\ndisorder, anxiety disorders and phobias, post-traumatic stress disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), among\nothers. The American Psychiatric Association publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (or DSM),\nwhich describes the symptoms required for a patient to be diagnosed with a particular mental disorder. Each newly released\nversion of the DSM contains different symptoms and classifications as scientists learn more about these disorders, their causes,\nand how they relate to each other. A more detailed discussion of two mental illnesses\u2014schizophrenia and major depression\u2014is\ngiven below.\nSchizophrenia\nSchizophrenia is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the United States. Symptoms\nof the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination, inappropriate and unregulated emotional\nresponses, difficulty thinking, and problems with social situations. People with schizophrenia can suffer from hallucinations\nand hear voices; they may also suffer from delusions. Patients also have so-called \u201cnegative\u201d symptoms like a flattened emotional\nstate, loss of pleasure, and loss of basic drives. Many schizophrenic patients are diagnosed in their late adolescence or early 20s.\nThe development of schizophrenia is thought to involve malfunctioning dopaminergic neurons and may also involve problems\nwith glutamate signaling. Treatment for the disease usually requires antipsychotic medications that work by blocking dopamine\nreceptors and decreasing dopamine neurotransmission in the brain. This decrease in dopamine can cause Parkinson\u2019s disease-\nlike symptoms in some patients. While some classes of antipsychotics can be quite effective at treating the disease, they are not\na cure, and most patients must remain medicated for the rest of their lives.\nDepression\nMajor depression affects approximately 6.7 percent of the adults in the United States each year and is one of the most common\nmental disorders. To be diagnosed with major depressive disorder, a person must have experienced a severely depressed mood\nlasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously\nenjoyed, changes in appetite and sleep schedules, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts. The\nexact causes of major depression are unknown and likely include both genetic and environmental risk factors. Some research\nsupports the \u201cclassic monoamine hypothesis,\u201d which suggests that depression is caused by a decrease in norepinephrine and\nserotonin neurotransmission. One argument against this hypothesis is the fact that some antidepressant medications cause an\nincrease in norepinephrine and serotonin release within a few hours of beginning treatment\u2014but clinical results of these\nmedications are not seen until weeks later. This has led to alternative hypotheses: for example, dopamine may also be decreased\nin depressed patients, or it may actually be an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin that causes the disease, and\nantidepressants force a feedback loop that decreases this release. Treatments for depression include psychotherapy,\nelectroconvulsive therapy, deep-brain stimulation, and prescription medications. There are several classes of antidepressant\nmedications that work through different mechanisms. For example, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) block the\nenzyme that degrades many neurotransmitters (including dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine), resulting in increased\n1010\nChapter 35 \u2022 The Nervous System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nneurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block the reuptake of serotonin into the\npresynaptic neuron. This blockage results in an increase in serotonin in the synaptic cleft. Other types of drugs such as\nnorepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also used to treat\ndepression.\nOther Neurological Disorders\nThere are several other neurological disorders that cannot be easily placed in the above categories. These include chronic pain\nconditions, cancers of the nervous system, epilepsy disorders, and stroke. Epilepsy and stroke are discussed below.\nEpilepsy\nEstimates suggest that up to three percent of people in the United States will be diagnosed with epilepsy in their lifetime. While\nthere are several different types of epilepsy, all are characterized by recurrent seizures. Epilepsy itself can be a symptom of a\nbrain injury, disease, or other illness. For example, people who have intellectual disability or ASD can experience seizures,\npresumably because the developmental wiring malfunctions that caused their disorders also put them at risk for epilepsy. For\nmany patients, however, the cause of their epilepsy is never identified and is likely to be a combination of genetic and\nenvironmental factors. Often, seizures can be controlled with anticonvulsant medications. However, for very severe cases,\npatients may undergo brain surgery to remove the brain area where seizures originate.\nStroke\nA stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage. Without the oxygen\nsupplied by blood flow, neurons in this brain region die. This neuronal death can cause many different symptoms\u2014depending\non the brain area affected\u2014 including headache, muscle weakness or paralysis, speech disturbances, sensory problems,\nmemory loss, and confusion. Stroke is often caused by blood clots and can also be caused by the bursting of a weak blood vessel.\nStrokes are extremely common and are the third most common cause of death in the United States. On average one person\nexperiences a stroke every 40 seconds in the United States. Approximately 75 percent of strokes occur in people older than 65.\nRisk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and a family history of stroke. Smoking doubles\nthe risk of stroke. Because a stroke is a medical emergency, patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go to the\nemergency room, where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed. These drugs will not work if the\nstroke was caused by a burst blood vessel or if the stroke occurred more than three hours before arriving at the hospital.\nTreatment following a stroke can include blood pressure medication (to prevent future strokes) and (sometimes intense)\nphysical therapy.\n35.5 \u2022 Nervous System Disorders\n1011\n", "key_terms": "\nacetylcholine\nneurotransmitter released by neurons in the\ncentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\naction potential\nself-propagating momentary change in\nthe electrical potential of a neuron (or muscle) membrane\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease\nneurodegenerative disorder\ncharacterized by problems with memory and thinking\namygdala\nstructure within the limbic system that\nprocesses fear\narachnoid mater\nspiderweb-like middle layer of the\nmeninges that cover the central nervous system\nastrocyte\nglial cell in the central nervous system that\nprovide nutrients, extracellular buffering, and structural\nsupport for neurons;

Neurons\nare specialized cells that are capable of sending electrical as\nwell as chemical signals. Most neurons contain dendrites,\nwhich receive these signals, and axons that send signals to\nother neurons or tissues. There are four main types of\nneurons: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar\nneurons. Glia are non-neuronal cells in the nervous system\nthat support neuronal development and signaling. There are\nseveral types of glia that serve different functions.\n35.2 How Neurons Communicate\nNeurons have charged membranes because there are\ndifferent concentrations of ions inside and outside of the\ncell. Voltage-gated ion channels control the movement of\nions into and out of a neuron. When a neuronal membrane is\ndepolarized to at least the threshold of excitation, an action\npotential is fired. The action potential is then propagated\nalong a myelinated axon to the axon terminals. In a chemical\nsynapse, the action potential causes release of\nneurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft. Through\nbinding to postsynaptic receptors, the neurotransmitter can\ncause excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials by\ndepolarizing or hyperpolarizing, respectively, the\npostsynaptic membrane. In electrical synapses, the action\npotential is directly communicated to the postsynaptic cell\nthrough gap junctions\u2014large channel proteins that connect\nthe pre-and postsynaptic membranes. Synapses are not\nstatic structures and can be strengthened and weakened.\nTwo mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are long-term\npotentiation and long-term depression.\n35.3 The Central Nervous System\nThe vertebrate central nervous system contains the brain and\nthe spinal cord, which are covered and protected by three\nChapter 35 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n1013\nmeninges. The brain contains structurally and functionally\ndefined regions. In mammals, these include the cortex\n(which can be broken down into four primary functional\nlobes: frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal), basal\nganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, limbic system,\ncerebellum, and brainstem\u2014although structures in some of\nthese designations overlap. While functions may be\nprimarily localized to one structure in the brain, most\ncomplex functions, like language and sleep, involve neurons\nin multiple brain regions. The spinal cord is the information\nsuperhighway that connects the brain with the rest of the\nbody through its connections with peripheral nerves. It\ntransmits sensory and motor input and also controls motor\nreflexes.\n35.4 The Peripheral Nervous\nSystem\nThe peripheral nervous system contains both the autonomic\nand sensory-somatic nervous systems. The autonomic\nnervous system provides unconscious control over visceral\nfunctions and has two divisions: the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous\nsystem is activated in stressful situations to prepare the\nanimal for a \u201cfight or flight\u201d response. The parasympathetic\nnervous system is active during restful periods. The sensory-\nsomatic nervous system is made of cranial and spinal nerves\nthat transmit sensory information from skin and muscle to\nthe CNS and motor commands from the CNS to the muscles.\n35.5 Nervous System Disorders\nSome general themes emerge from the sampling of nervous\nsystem disorders presented above. The causes for most\ndisorders are not fully understood\u2014at least not for all\npatients\u2014and likely involve a combination of nature (genetic\nmutations that become risk factors) and nurture (emotional\ntrauma, stress, hazardous chemical exposure).

(credit: modification of work by Hermanus Backpackers Hostel, South Africa)\nINTRODUCTION In more advanced animals, the senses are constantly at work, making the animal\naware of stimuli\u2014such as light, or sound, or the presence of a chemical substance in the external\nenvironment\u2014and monitoring information about the organism\u2019s internal environment. All bilaterally\nsymmetric animals have a sensory system, and the development of any species\u2019 sensory system has been\ndriven by natural selection; thus, sensory systems differ among species according to the demands of\ntheir environments. The shark, unlike most fish predators, is electrosensitive\u2014that is, sensitive to\nelectrical fields produced by other animals in its environment. While it is helpful to this underwater\npredator, electrosensitivity is a sense not found in most land animals.\nChapter Outline\n36.1 Sensory Processes\n36.2 Somatosensation\n36.3 Taste and Smell\n36.4 Hearing and\nVestibular\nSensation\n36.5 Vision\nSenses provide information about the body and its environment. Humans have five special senses: olfaction\n(smell), gustation (taste), equilibrium (balance and body position), vision, and hearing. Additionally, we\npossess general senses, also called somatosensation, which respond to stimuli like temperature, pain,\npressure, and vibration. Vestibular sensation, which is an organism\u2019s sense of spatial orientation and\nbalance, proprioception (position of bones, joints, and muscles), and the sense of limb position that is used\nto track kinesthesia (limb movement) are part of somatosensation. Although the sensory systems associated\nwith these senses are very different, all share a common function: to convert a stimulus (such as light, or\nsound, or the position of the body) into an electrical signal in the nervous system. This process is called\nsensory transduction.\nThere are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction. In one, a neuron works\nwith a sensory receptor, a cell, or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific\nstimulus. Stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron, which carries\ninformation about the stimulus to the central nervous system. In the second type of sensory transduction, a\nsensory nerve ending responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment: this neuron constitutes\nthe sensory receptor. Free nerve endings can be stimulated by several different stimuli, thus showing little\nreceptor specificity. For example, pain receptors in your gums and teeth may be stimulated by temperature\nchanges, chemical stimulation, or pressure.\nReception\nThe first step in sensation is reception, which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as\nmechanical stimuli (being bent or squished, for example), chemicals, or temperature. The receptor can then\nrespond to the stimuli. The region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus, be it\nfar away or in contact with the body, is that receptor\u2019s receptive field. Think for a moment about the\ndifferences in receptive fields for the different senses. For the sense of touch, a stimulus must come into\ncontact with the body. For the sense of hearing, a stimulus can be a moderate distance away (some baleen\nwhale sounds can propagate for many kilometers). For vision, a stimulus can be very far away; for example,\nthe visual system perceives light from stars at enormous distances.\nTransduction\nThe most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical\nsignal in the nervous system. This takes place at the sensory receptor, and the change in electrical potential\nthat is produced is called the receptor potential. How is sensory input, such as pressure on the skin,\nchanged to a receptor potential? In this example, a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor (as shown in\nFigure 36.2) possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure. Disturbance of these dendrites by\ncompressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory\nneuron, changing its electrical potential. Recall that in the nervous system, a positive change of a neuron\u2019s\nelectrical potential (also called the membrane potential), depolarizes the neuron. Receptor potentials are\ngraded potentials: the magnitude of these graded (receptor) potentials varies with the strength of the\nstimulus. If the magnitude of depolarization is sufficient (that is, if membrane potential reaches a\nthreshold), the neuron will fire an action potential. In most cases, the correct stimulus impinging on a\nsensory receptor will drive membrane potential in a positive direction, although for some receptors, such as\nthose in the visual system, this is not always the case.\n1018\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 36.2 (a) Mechanosensitive ion channels are gated ion channels that respond to mechanical deformation of the plasma membrane. A\nmechanosensitive channel is connected to the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton by hair-like tethers. When pressure causes the\nextracellular matrix to move, the channel opens, allowing ions to enter or exit the cell. (b) Stereocilia in the human ear are connected to\nmechanosensitive ion channels. When a sound causes the stereocilia to move, mechanosensitive ion channels transduce the signal to the\ncochlear nerve.\nSensory receptors for different senses are very different from each other, and they are specialized according to the type of\nstimulus they sense: they have receptor specificity. For example, touch receptors, light receptors, and sound receptors are each\nactivated by different stimuli. Touch receptors are not sensitive to light or sound; they are sensitive only to touch or pressure.\nHowever, stimuli may be combined at higher levels in the brain, as happens with olfaction, contributing to our sense of taste.\nEncoding and Transmission of Sensory Information\nFour aspects of sensory information are encoded by sensory systems: the type of stimulus, the location of the stimulus in the\nreceptive field, the duration of the stimulus, and the relative intensity of the stimulus. Thus, action potentials transmitted over a\nsensory receptor\u2019s afferent axons encode one type of stimulus, and this segregation of the senses is preserved in other sensory\ncircuits. For example, auditory receptors transmit signals over their own dedicated system, and electrical activity in the axons of\nthe auditory receptors will be interpreted by the brain as an auditory stimulus\u2014a sound.\nThe intensity of a stimulus is often encoded in the rate of action potentials produced by the sensory receptor. Thus, an intense\nstimulus will produce a more rapid train of action potentials, and reducing the stimulus will likewise slow the rate of production\nof action potentials. A second way in which intensity is encoded is by the number of receptors activated. An intense stimulus\nmight initiate action potentials in a large number of adjacent receptors, while a less intense stimulus might stimulate fewer\nreceptors. Integration of sensory information begins as soon as the information is received in the CNS, and the brain will\nfurther process incoming signals.\n36.1 \u2022 Sensory Processes\n1019\nPerception\nPerception is an individual\u2019s interpretation of a sensation. Although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors,\nperception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor, but at higher levels in the nervous system, in the brain. The brain\ndistinguishes sensory stimuli through a sensory pathway: action potentials from sensory receptors travel along neurons that are\ndedicated to a particular stimulus. These neurons are dedicated to that particular stimulus and synapse with particular neurons\nin the brain or spinal cord.\nAll sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, are transmitted though the central nervous system and are routed to\nthe thalamus and to the appropriate region of the cortex. Recall that the thalamus is a structure in the forebrain that serves as a\nclearinghouse and relay station for sensory (as well as motor) signals. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is\nconducted to the specific area of the cortex (Figure 36.3) dedicated to processing that particular sense.\nHow are neural signals interpreted? Interpretation of sensory signals between individuals of the same species is largely similar,\nowing to the inherited similarity of their nervous systems; however, there are some individual differences. A good example of\nthis is individual tolerances to a painful stimulus, such as dental pain, which certainly differ.\nFigure 36.3 In humans, with the exception of olfaction, all sensory signals are routed from the (a) thalamus to (b) final processing regions in\nthe cortex of the brain. (credit b: modification of work by Polina Tishina)\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD CONNECTION\nJust-Noticeable Difference\nIt is easy to differentiate between a one-pound bag of rice and a two-pound bag of rice. There is a one-pound difference, and one\nbag is twice as heavy as the other. However, would it be as easy to differentiate between a 20- and a 21-pound bag?\nQuestion: What is the smallest detectible weight difference between a one-pound bag of rice and a larger bag? What is the\nsmallest detectible difference between a 20-pound bag and a larger bag? In both cases, at what weights are the differences\ndetected? This smallest detectible difference in stimuli is known as the just-noticeable difference (JND).\nBackground: Research background literature on JND and on Weber\u2019s Law, a description of a proposed mathematical\nrelationship between the overall magnitude of the stimulus and the JND. You will be testing JND of different weights of rice in\nbags. Choose a convenient increment that is to be stepped through while testing. For example, you could choose 10 percent\nincrements between one and two pounds (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and so on) or 20 percent increments (1.2, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8).\nHypothesis: Develop a hypothesis about JND in terms of percentage of the whole weight being tested (such as \u201cthe JND between\nthe two small bags and between the two large bags is proportionally the same,\u201d or \u201c. . . is not proportionally the same.\u201d) So, for\nthe first hypothesis, if the JND between the one-pound bag and a larger bag is 0.2 pounds (that is, 20 percent; 1.0 pound feels\nthe same as 1.1 pounds, but 1.0 pound feels less than 1.2 pounds), then the JND between the 20-pound bag and a larger bag will\nalso be 20 percent. (So, 20 pounds feels the same as 22 pounds or 23 pounds, but 20 pounds feels less than 24 pounds.)\nTest the hypothesis: Enlist 24 participants, and split them into two groups of 12. To set up the demonstration, assuming a 10\npercent increment was selected, have the first group be the one-pound group. As a counter-balancing measure against a\n1020\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nsystematic error, however, six of the first group will compare one pound to two pounds, and step down in weight (1.0 to 2.0, 1.0\nto 1.9, and so on), while the other six will step up (1.0 to 1.1, 1.0 to 1.2, and so on). Apply the same principle to the 20-pound\ngroup (20 to 40, 20 to 38, and so on, and 20 to 22, 20 to 24, and so on). Given the large difference between 20 and 40 pounds, you\nmay wish to use 30 pounds as your larger weight. In any case, use two weights that are easily detectable as different.\nRecord the observations: Record the data in a table similar to the table below. For the one-pound and 20-pound groups (base\nweights) record a plus sign (+) for each participant that detects a difference between the base weight and the step weight. Record\na minus sign (-) for each participant that finds no difference. If one-tenth steps were not used, then replace the steps in the\n\u201cStep Weight\u201d columns with the step you are using.\nResults of JND Testing (+ = difference; \u2013 = no difference)\nStep Weight\nOne pound\n20 pounds\nStep Weight\n1.1\n22\n1.2\n24\n1.3\n26\n1.4\n28\n1.5\n30\n1.6\n32\n1.7\n34\n1.8\n36\n1.9\n38\n2.0\n40\nTable 36.1\nAnalyze the data/report the results: What step weight did all participants find to be equal with one-pound base weight? What\nabout the 20-pound group?\nDraw a conclusion: Did the data support the hypothesis? Are the final weights proportionally the same? If not, why not? Do the\nfindings adhere to Weber\u2019s Law? Weber\u2019s Law states that the concept that a just-noticeable difference in a stimulus is\nproportional to the magnitude of the original stimulus.\n36.2 Somatosensation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe four important mechanoreceptors in human skin\n\u2022\nDescribe the topographical distribution of somatosensory receptors between glabrous and hairy skin\n\u2022\nExplain why the perception of pain is subjective\nSomatosensation is a mixed sensory category and includes all sensation received from the skin and mucous membranes, as well\nfrom as the limbs and joints. Somatosensation is also known as tactile sense, or more familiarly, as the sense of touch.\nSomatosensation occurs all over the exterior of the body and at some interior locations as well. A variety of receptor\ntypes\u2014embedded in the skin, mucous membranes, muscles, joints, internal organs, and cardiovascular system\u2014play a role.\n36.2 \u2022 Somatosensation\n1021\nRecall that the epidermis is the outermost layer of skin in mammals. It is relatively thin, is composed of keratin-filled cells, and\nhas no blood supply. The epidermis serves as a barrier to water and to invasion by pathogens. Below this, the much thicker\ndermis contains blood vessels, sweat glands, hair follicles, lymph vessels, and lipid-secreting sebaceous glands (Figure 36.4).\nBelow the epidermis and dermis is the subcutaneous tissue, or hypodermis, the fatty layer that contains blood vessels,\nconnective tissue, and the axons of sensory neurons. The hypodermis, which holds about 50 percent of the body\u2019s fat, attaches\nthe dermis to the bone and muscle, and supplies nerves and blood vessels to the dermis.\nFigure 36.4 Mammalian skin has three layers: an epidermis, a dermis, and a hypodermis. (credit: modification of work by Don Bliss,\nNational Cancer Institute)\nSomatosensory Receptors\nSensory receptors are classified into five categories: mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, proprioceptors, pain receptors, and\nchemoreceptors. These categories are based on the nature of stimuli each receptor class transduces. What is commonly referred\nto as \u201ctouch\u201d involves more than one kind of stimulus and more than one kind of receptor. Mechanoreceptors in the skin are\ndescribed as encapsulated (that is, surrounded by a capsule) or unencapsulated (a group that includes free nerve endings). A free\nnerve ending, as its name implies, is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron. Free nerve endings are the most common\nnerve endings in skin, and they extend into the middle of the epidermis. Free nerve endings are sensitive to painful stimuli, to\nhot and cold, and to light touch. They are slow to adjust to a stimulus and so are less sensitive to abrupt changes in stimulation.\nThere are three classes of mechanoreceptors: tactile, proprioceptors, and baroreceptors. Mechanoreceptors sense stimuli due to\nphysical deformation of their plasma membranes. They contain mechanically gated ion channels whose gates open or close in\nresponse to pressure, touch, stretching, and sound.\u201d There are four primary tactile mechanoreceptors in human skin: Merkel\u2019s\ndisks, Meissner\u2019s corpuscles, Ruffini endings, and Pacinian corpuscles; two are located toward the surface of the skin and two\nare located deeper. A fifth type of mechanoreceptor, Krause end bulbs, are found only in specialized regions. Merkel\u2019s disks\n(shown in Figure 36.5) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis, both in skin that has hair and on\nglabrous skin, that is, the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers, the soles of the feet, and the lips of humans and other\nprimates. Merkel\u2019s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips. They are slow-adapting, encapsulated nerve endings,\nand they respond to light touch. Light touch, also known as discriminative touch, is a light pressure that allows the location of a\nstimulus to be pinpointed. The receptive fields of Merkel\u2019s disks are small with well-defined borders. That makes them finely\nsensitive to edges and they come into use in tasks such as typing on a keyboard.\n1022\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 36.5 Four of the primary mechanoreceptors in human skin are shown. Merkel\u2019s disks, which are unencapsulated, respond to light\ntouch. Meissner\u2019s corpuscles, Ruffini endings, Pacinian corpuscles, and Krause end bulbs are all encapsulated. Meissner\u2019s corpuscles\nrespond to touch and low-frequency vibration. Ruffini endings detect stretch, deformation within joints, and warmth. Pacinian corpuscles\ndetect transient pressure and high-frequency vibration. Krause end bulbs detect cold.\nWhich of the following statements about mechanoreceptors is false?\na.\nPacinian corpuscles are found in both glabrous and hairy skin.\nb.\nMerkel\u2019s disks are abundant on the fingertips and lips.\nc.\nRuffini endings are encapsulated mechanoreceptors.\nd.\nMeissner\u2019s corpuscles extend into the lower dermis.\nMeissner\u2019s corpuscles, (shown in Figure 36.6) also known as tactile corpuscles, are found in the upper dermis, but they project\ninto the epidermis. They, too, are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and eyelids. They respond to fine touch\nand pressure, but they also respond to low-frequency vibration or flutter. They are rapidly adapting, fluid-filled, encapsulated\nneurons with small, well-defined borders and are responsive to fine details. Like Merkel\u2019s disks, Meissner\u2019s corpuscles are not as\nplentiful in the palms as they are in the fingertips.\nFigure 36.6 Meissner corpuscles in the fingertips, such as the one viewed here using bright field light microscopy, allow for touch\ndiscrimination of fine detail. (credit: modification of work by \"Wbensmith\"/Wikimedia Commons; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nDeeper in the epidermis, near the base, are Ruffini endings, which are also known as bulbous corpuscles. They are found in both\nglabrous and hairy skin. These are slow-adapting, encapsulated mechanoreceptors that detect skin stretch and deformations\nwithin joints, so they provide valuable feedback for gripping objects and controlling finger position and movement. Thus, they\nalso contribute to proprioception and kinesthesia. Ruffini endings also detect warmth. Note that these warmth detectors are\nsituated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors. It is not surprising, then, that humans detect cold stimuli before they\ndetect warm stimuli.\n36.2 \u2022 Somatosensation\n1023\nPacinian corpuscles (seen in Figure 36.7) are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and are structurally\nsimilar to Meissner\u2019s corpuscles; they are found in the bone periosteum, joint capsules, pancreas and other viscera, breast, and\ngenitals. They are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient (but not prolonged) pressure and high-\nfrequency vibration. Pacinian receptors detect pressure and vibration by being compressed, stimulating their internal\ndendrites. There are fewer Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings in skin than there are Merkel\u2019s disks and Meissner\u2019s\ncorpuscles.\nFigure 36.7 Pacinian corpuscles, such as these visualized using bright field light microscopy, detect pressure (touch) and high-frequency\nvibration. (credit: modification of work by Ed Uthman; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nIn proprioception, proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals travel through myelinated afferent neurons running from the spinal\ncord to the medulla. Neurons are not physically connected, but communicate via neurotransmitters secreted into synapses or\n\u201cgaps\u201d between communicating neurons. Once in the medulla, the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus.\nMuscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch, or lengthening of muscles. Related to these are Golgi\ntendon organs, which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction. Proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals\ncome from limbs. Unconscious proprioceptive signals run from the spinal cord to the cerebellum, the brain region that\ncoordinates muscle contraction, rather than to the thalamus, like most other sensory information.\nBaroreceptors detect pressure changes in an organ. They are found in the walls of the carotid artery and the aorta where they\nmonitor blood pressure, and in the lungs where they detect the degree of lung expansion. Stretch receptors are found at various\nsites in the digestive and urinary systems.\nIn addition to these two types of deeper receptors, there are also rapidly adapting hair receptors, which are found on nerve\nendings that wrap around the base of hair follicles. There are a few types of hair receptors that detect slow and rapid hair\nmovement, and they differ in their sensitivity to movement. Some hair receptors also detect skin deflection, and certain rapidly\nadapting hair receptors allow detection of stimuli that have not yet touched the skin.\nIntegration of Signals from Mechanoreceptors\nThe configuration of the different types of receptors working in concert in human skin results in a very refined sense of touch.\nThe nociceptive receptors\u2014those that detect pain\u2014are located near the surface. Small, finely calibrated\nmechanoreceptors\u2014Merkel\u2019s disks and Meissner\u2019s corpuscles\u2014are located in the upper layers and can precisely localize even\ngentle touch. The large mechanoreceptors\u2014Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings\u2014are located in the lower layers and\nrespond to deeper touch. (Consider that the deep pressure that reaches those deeper receptors would not need to be finely\nlocalized.) Both the upper and lower layers of the skin hold rapidly and slowly adapting receptors. Both primary somatosensory\ncortex and secondary cortical areas are responsible for processing the complex picture of stimuli transmitted from the interplay\nof mechanoreceptors.\nDensity of Mechanoreceptors\nThe distribution of touch receptors in human skin is not consistent over the body. In humans, touch receptors are less dense in\n1024\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nskin covered with any type of hair, such as the arms, legs, torso, and face. Touch receptors are denser in glabrous skin (the type\nfound on human fingertips and lips, for example), which is typically more sensitive and is thicker than hairy skin (4 to 5 mm\nversus 2 to 3 mm).\nHow is receptor density estimated in a human subject? The relative density of pressure receptors in different locations on the\nbody can be demonstrated experimentally using a two-point discrimination test. In this demonstration, two sharp points, such\nas two thumbtacks, are brought into contact with the subject\u2019s skin (though not hard enough to cause pain or break the skin).\nThe subject reports if he or she feels one point or two points. If the two points are felt as one point, it can be inferred that the two\npoints are both in the receptive field of a single sensory receptor. If two points are felt as two separate points, each is in the\nreceptive field of two separate sensory receptors. The points could then be moved closer and retested until the subject reports\nfeeling only one point, and the size of the receptive field of a single receptor could be estimated from that distance.\nThermoreception\nIn addition to Krause end bulbs that detect cold and Ruffini endings that detect warmth, there are different types of cold\nreceptors on some free nerve endings: thermoreceptors, located in the dermis, skeletal muscles, liver, and hypothalamus, that\nare activated by different temperatures. Their pathways into the brain run from the spinal cord through the thalamus to the\nprimary somatosensory cortex. Warmth and cold information from the face travels through one of the cranial nerves to the\nbrain. You know from experience that a tolerably cold or hot stimulus can quickly progress to a much more intense stimulus that\nis no longer tolerable. Any stimulus that is too intense can be perceived as pain because temperature sensations are conducted\nalong the same pathways that carry pain sensations.\nPain\nPain is the name given to nociception, which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage. Pain is\ncaused by true sources of injury, such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive\nchemical. But pain also can be caused by harmless stimuli that mimic the action of damaging stimuli, such as contact with\ncapsaicins, the compounds that cause peppers to taste hot and which are used in self-defense pepper sprays and certain topical\nmedications. Peppers taste \u201chot\u201d because the protein receptors that bind capsaicin open the same calcium channels that are\nactivated by warm receptors.\nNociception starts at the sensory receptors, but pain, inasmuch as it is the perception of nociception, does not start until it is\ncommunicated to the brain. There are several nociceptive pathways to and through the brain. Most axons carrying nociceptive\ninformation into the brain from the spinal cord project to the thalamus (as do other sensory neurons) and the neural signal\nundergoes final processing in the primary somatosensory cortex. Interestingly, one nociceptive pathway projects not to the\nthalamus but directly to the hypothalamus in the forebrain, which modulates the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine functions\nof the autonomic nervous system. Recall that threatening\u2014or painful\u2014stimuli stimulate the sympathetic branch of the visceral\nsensory system, readying a fight-or-flight response.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView this video (http://openstax.org/l/nociceptive) that animates the five phases of nociceptive pain.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/nociceptive)\n36.3 Taste and Smell\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain in what way smell and taste stimuli differ from other sensory stimuli\n\u2022\nIdentify the five primary tastes that can be distinguished by humans\n\u2022\nExplain in anatomical terms why a dog\u2019s sense of smell is more acute than a human\u2019s\nTaste, also called gustation, and smell, also called olfaction, are the most interconnected senses in that both involve molecules\nof the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors. Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other\nanimals\u2014whether potential mates, predators, or prey\u2014or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival.\nSimilarly, the sense of taste allows animals to discriminate between types of foods. While the value of a sense of smell is obvious,\nwhat is the value of a sense of taste? Different tasting foods have different attributes, both helpful and harmful. For example,\nsweet-tasting substances tend to be highly caloric, which could be necessary for survival in lean times. Bitterness is associated\n36.3 \u2022 Taste and Smell\n1025\nwith toxicity, and sourness is associated with spoiled food. Salty foods are valuable in maintaining homeostasis by helping the\nbody retain water and by providing ions necessary for cells to function.\nTastes and Odors\nBoth taste and odor stimuli are molecules taken in from the environment. The primary tastes detected by humans are sweet,\nsour, bitter, salty, and umami. The first four tastes need little explanation. The identification of umami as a fundamental taste\noccurred fairly recently\u2014it was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth, but\nit was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later. The taste of umami, also\nknown as savoriness, is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L-glutamate. In fact, monosodium glutamate, or MSG, is\noften used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods. What is the adaptive value of being able to distinguish\numami? Savory substances tend to be high in protein.\nAll odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe. If a substance does not release molecules into the air from its\nsurface, it has no smell. And if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that recognizes a specific molecule, then that\nmolecule has no smell. Humans have about 350 olfactory receptor subtypes that work in various combinations to allow us to\nsense about 10,000 different odors. Compare that to mice, for example, which have about 1,300 olfactory receptor types, and\ntherefore probably sense more odors. Both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specific chemoreceptors. Although\nhumans commonly distinguish taste as one sense and smell as another, they work together to create the perception of flavor. A\nperson\u2019s perception of flavor is reduced if he or she has congested nasal passages.\nReception and Transduction\nOdorants (odor molecules) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium, the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity (as\nillustrated in Figure 36.8). The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal\ncavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans. Recall that sensory cells are neurons. An olfactory receptor, which is a\ndendrite of a specialized neuron, responds when it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by sending impulses\ndirectly to the olfactory bulb of the brain. Humans have about 12 million olfactory receptors, distributed among hundreds of\ndifferent receptor types that respond to different odors. Twelve million seems like a large number of receptors, but compare that\nto other animals: rabbits have about 100 million, most dogs have about 1 billion, and bloodhounds\u2014dogs selectively bred for\ntheir sense of smell\u2014have about 4 billion. The overall size of the olfactory epithelium also differs between species, with that of\nbloodhounds, for example, being many times larger than that of humans.\nOlfactory neurons are bipolar neurons (neurons with two processes from the cell body). Each neuron has a single dendrite\nburied in the olfactory epithelium, and extending from this dendrite are 5 to 20 receptor-laden, hair-like cilia that trap odorant\nmolecules. The sensory receptors on the cilia are proteins, and it is the variations in their amino acid chains that make the\nreceptors sensitive to different odorants. Each olfactory sensory neuron has only one type of receptor on its cilia, and the\nreceptors are specialized to detect specific odorants, so the bipolar neurons themselves are specialized. When an odorant binds\nwith a receptor that recognizes it, the sensory neuron associated with the receptor is stimulated. Olfactory stimulation is the\nonly sensory information that directly reaches the cerebral cortex, whereas other sensations are relayed through the thalamus.\n1026\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 36.8 In the human olfactory system, (a) bipolar olfactory neurons extend from (b) the olfactory epithelium, where olfactory\nreceptors are located, to the olfactory bulb.

Carl Jaffe, MD,\ncardiologist)\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nPheromones\nA pheromone is a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or physiology of animals of the same species.\nPheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them, but pheromones apparently are not consciously\nperceived in the same way as other odors. There are several different types of pheromones, which are released in urine or as\nglandular secretions. Certain pheromones are attractants to potential mates, others are repellants to potential competitors of\nthe same sex, and still others play roles in mother-infant attachment. Some pheromones can also influence the timing of\npuberty, modify reproductive cycles, and even prevent embryonic implantation. While the roles of pheromones in many\nnonhuman species are important, pheromones have become less important in human behavior over evolutionary time\ncompared to their importance to organisms with more limited behavioral repertoires.\nThe vomeronasal organ (VNO, or Jacobson\u2019s organ) is a tubular, fluid-filled, olfactory organ present in many vertebrate animals\nthat sits adjacent to the nasal cavity. It is very sensitive to pheromones and is connected to the nasal cavity by a duct. When\nmolecules dissolve in the mucosa of the nasal cavity, they then enter the VNO where the pheromone molecules among them\nbind with specialized pheromone receptors. Upon exposure to pheromones from their own species or others, many animals,\nincluding cats, may display the flehmen response (shown in Figure 36.9), a curling of the upper lip that helps pheromone\nmolecules enter the VNO.\nPheromonal signals are sent, not to the main olfactory bulb, but to a different neural structure that projects directly to the\namygdala (recall that the amygdala is a brain center important in emotional reactions, such as fear). The pheromonal signal then\ncontinues to areas of the hypothalamus that are key to reproductive physiology and behavior. While some scientists assert that\nthe VNO is apparently functionally vestigial in humans, even though there is a similar structure located near human nasal\ncavities, others are researching it as a possible functional system that may, for example, contribute to synchronization of\nmenstrual cycles in women living in close proximity.\n36.3 \u2022 Taste and Smell\n1027\nFigure 36.9 The flehmen response in this tiger results in the curling of the upper lip and helps airborne pheromone molecules enter the\nvomeronasal organ. (credit: modification of work by \"chadh\"/Flickr)\nTaste\nDetecting a taste (gustation) is fairly similar to detecting an odor (olfaction), given that both taste and smell rely on chemical\nreceptors being stimulated by certain molecules. The primary organ of taste is the taste bud. A taste bud is a cluster of gustatory\nreceptors (taste cells) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae (singular: papilla) (illustrated in Figure\n36.11). There are several structurally distinct papillae. Filiform papillae, which are located across the tongue, are tactile,\nproviding friction that helps the tongue move substances, and contain no taste cells. In contrast, fungiform papillae, which are\nlocated mainly on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, each contain one to eight taste buds and also have receptors for\npressure and temperature. The large circumvallate papillae contain up to 250 taste buds and form a V near the posterior margin\nof the tongue.\nFigure 36.10 (a) Foliate, circumvallate, and fungiform papillae are located on different regions of the tongue. (b) Foliate papillae are\nprominent protrusions on this light micrograph. (credit a: modification of work by NCI; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nIn addition to those two types of chemically and mechanically sensitive papillae are foliate papillae\u2014leaf-like papillae located in\nparallel folds along the edges and toward the back of the tongue, as seen in the Figure 36.10 micrograph. Foliate papillae contain\nabout 1,300 taste buds within their folds. Finally, there are circumvallate papillae, which are wall-like papillae in the shape of an\ninverted \u201cV\u201d at the back of the tongue. Each of these papillae is surrounded by a groove and contains about 250 taste buds.\nEach taste bud\u2019s taste cells are replaced every 10 to 14 days. These are elongated cells with hair-like processes called microvilli at\nthe tips that extend into the taste bud pore (illustrated in Figure 36.11). Food molecules (tastants) are dissolved in saliva, and they\nbind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli. The receptors for tastants are located across the outer portion and front\nof the tongue, outside of the middle area where the filiform papillae are most prominent.\n1028\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 36.11 Pores in the tongue allow tastants to enter taste pores in the tongue. (credit: modification of work by Vincenzo Rizzo)\nIn humans, there are five primary tastes, and each taste has only one corresponding type of receptor. Thus, like olfaction, each\nreceptor is specific to its stimulus (tastant). Transduction of the five tastes happens through different mechanisms that reflect\nthe molecular composition of the tastant. A salty tastant (containing NaCl) provides the sodium ions (Na+) that enter the taste\nneurons and excite them directly. Sour tastants are acids and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family. Binding of an acid or\nother sour-tasting molecule triggers a change in the ion channel and these increase hydrogen ion (H+) concentrations in the\ntaste neurons, thus depolarizing them. Sweet, bitter, and umami tastants require a G-protein coupled receptor. These tastants\nbind to their respective receptors, thereby exciting the specialized neurons associated with them.\nBoth tasting abilities and sense of smell change with age. In humans, the senses decline dramatically by age 50 and continue to\ndecline. A child may find a food to be too spicy, whereas an elderly person may find the same food to be bland and unappetizing.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView this animation (http://openstax.org/l/taste) that shows how the sense of taste works.\nSmell and Taste in the Brain\nOlfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin, unmyelinated axons. The olfactory bulb is\ncomposed of neural clusters called glomeruli, and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory receptor, so each\nglomerulus is specific to one odorant. From glomeruli, olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the\nfrontal cortex and the thalamus. Recall that this is a different path from most other sensory information, which is sent directly\n36.3 \u2022 Taste and Smell\n1029\nto the thalamus before ending up in the cortex. Olfactory signals also travel directly to the amygdala, thereafter reaching the\nhypothalamus, thalamus, and frontal cortex. The last structure that olfactory signals directly travel to is a cortical center in the\ntemporal lobe structure important in spatial, autobiographical, declarative, and episodic memories. Olfaction is finally\nprocessed by areas of the brain that deal with memory, emotions, reproduction, and thought.\nTaste neurons project from taste cells in the tongue, esophagus, and palate to the medulla, in the brainstem. From the medulla,\ntaste signals travel to the thalamus and then to the primary gustatory cortex. Information from different regions of the tongue\nis segregated in the medulla, thalamus, and cortex.\n36.4 Hearing and Vestibular Sensation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the relationship of amplitude and frequency of a sound wave to attributes of sound\n\u2022\nTrace the path of sound through the auditory system to the site of transduction of sound\n\u2022\nIdentify the structures of the vestibular system that respond to gravity\nAudition, or hearing, is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions. It enables an organism to\ndetect and receive information about danger, such as an approaching predator, and to participate in communal exchanges like\nthose concerning territories or mating. On the other hand, although it is physically linked to the auditory system, the vestibular\nsystem is not involved in hearing. Instead, an animal\u2019s vestibular system detects its own movement, both linear and angular\nacceleration and deceleration, and balance.\nSound\nAuditory stimuli are sound waves, which are mechanical, pressure waves that move through a medium, such as air or water.\nThere are no sound waves in a vacuum since there are no air molecules to move in waves. The speed of sound waves differs, based\non altitude, temperature, and medium, but at sea level and a temperature of 20\u00ba C (68\u00ba F), sound waves travel in the air at about\n343 meters per second.\nAs is true for all waves, there are four main characteristics of a sound wave: frequency, wavelength, period, and amplitude.\nFrequency is the number of waves per unit of time, and in sound is heard as pitch. High-frequency (\u226515.000Hz) sounds are\nhigher-pitched (short wavelength) than low-frequency (long wavelengths; \u2264100Hz) sounds. Frequency is measured in cycles per\nsecond, and for sound, the most commonly used unit is hertz (Hz), or cycles per second. Most humans can perceive sounds with\nfrequencies between 30 and 20,000 Hz. Women are typically better at hearing high frequencies, but everyone\u2019s ability to hear\nhigh frequencies decreases with age. Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz; cats, 60,000 Hz; bats, 100,000 Hz; and dolphins\n150,000 Hz, and American shad (Alosa sapidissima), a fish, can hear 180,000 Hz. Those frequencies above the human range are\ncalled ultrasound.\nAmplitude, or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough, in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in Figure 36.12. The\nsound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds. For sound, volume is measured in decibels\n(dB). The softest sound that a human can hear is the zero point. Humans speak normally at 60 decibels.\nFigure 36.12 For sound waves, wavelength corresponds to pitch. Amplitude of the wave corresponds to volume. The sound wave shown\n1030\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nwith a dashed line is softer in volume than the sound wave shown with a solid line. (credit: NIH)\nReception of Sound\nIn mammals, sound waves are collected by the external, cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna, then travel through the\nauditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum, the innermost part of the outer ear\n(illustrated in Figure 36.13). Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear. The middle ear holds three small bones called the\nossicles, which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear. The three ossicles are the malleus (also known as\nthe hammer), the incus (the anvil), and stapes (the stirrup). The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup. The three\nossicles are unique to mammals, and each plays a role in hearing. The malleus attaches at three points to the interior surface of\nthe tympanic membrane. The incus attaches the malleus to the stapes. In humans, the stapes is not long enough to reach the\ntympanum. If we did not have the malleus and the incus, then the vibrations of the tympanum would never reach the inner ear.\nThese bones also function to collect force and amplify sounds. The ear ossicles are homologous to bones in a fish mouth: the\nbones that support gills in fish are thought to be adapted for use in the vertebrate ear over evolutionary time. Many animals\n(frogs, reptiles, and birds, for example) use the stapes of the middle ear to transmit vibrations to the middle ear.\nFigure 36.13 Sound travels through the outer ear to the middle ear, which is bounded on its exterior by the tympanic membrane. The\nmiddle ear contains three bones called ossicles that transfer the sound wave to the oval window, the exterior boundary of the inner ear. The\norgan of Corti, which is the organ of sound transduction, lies inside the cochlea.\nTransduction of Sound\nVibrating objects, such as vocal cords, create sound waves or pressure waves in the air. When these pressure waves reach the ear,\nthe ear transduces this mechanical stimulus (pressure wave) into a nerve impulse (electrical signal) that the brain perceives as\nsound. The pressure waves strike the tympanum, causing it to vibrate. The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum\ntransmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear. The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the\noval window, which is the outermost structure of the inner ear. The structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth, a\nbony, hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear. Here, the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the\nstapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea. The vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves\nin the fluid (perilymph) inside the cochlea. The cochlea is a whorled structure, like the shell of a snail, and it contains receptors\nfor transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal (as illustrated in Figure 36.14). Inside the cochlea, the basilar\nmembrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea, curling toward the cochlea\u2019s center.\nThe mechanical properties of the basilar membrane change along its length, such that it is thicker, tauter, and narrower at the\noutside of the whorl (where the cochlea is largest), and thinner, floppier, and broader toward the apex, or center, of the whorl\n(where the cochlea is smallest). Different regions of the basilar membrane vibrate according to the frequency of the sound wave\n36.4 \u2022 Hearing and Vestibular Sensation\n1031\nconducted through the fluid in the cochlea. For these reasons, the fluid-filled cochlea detects different wave frequencies\n(pitches) at different regions of the membrane. When the sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar membrane, it\nflexes back and forth in a wave-like fashion. Above the basilar membrane is the tectorial membrane.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 36.14 A sound wave causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate. This vibration is amplified as it moves across the malleus, incus, and\nstapes. The amplified vibration is picked up by the oval window causing pressure waves in the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani.\nThe complexity of the pressure waves is determined by the changes in amplitude and frequency of the sound waves entering the ear.\nCochlear implants can restore hearing in people who have a nonfunctional cochlea. The implant consists of a microphone that\npicks up sound. A speech processor selects sounds in the range of human speech, and a transmitter converts these sounds to\nelectrical impulses, which are then sent to the auditory nerve. Which of the following types of hearing loss would not be restored\nby a cochlear implant?\na.\nHearing loss resulting from absence or loss of hair cells in the organ of Corti.\nb.\nHearing loss resulting from an abnormal auditory nerve.\nc.\nHearing loss resulting from fracture of the cochlea.\nd.\nHearing loss resulting from damage to bones of the middle ear.\nThe site of transduction is in the organ of Corti (spiral organ). It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar\nmembrane like flowers projecting up from soil, with their exposed short, hair-like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the\ntectorial membrane above them. The inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row, numbering\napproximately 3,500. The stereocilia from inner hair cells extend into small dimples on the tectorial membrane\u2019s lower surface.\nThe outer hair cells are arranged in three or four rows. They number approximately 12,000, and they function to fine tune\nincoming sound waves. The longer stereocilia that project from the outer hair cells actually attach to the tectorial membrane. All\n1032\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nof the stereocilia are mechanoreceptors, and when bent by vibrations they respond by opening a gated ion channel (refer to\nFigure 36.15). As a result, the hair cell membrane is depolarized, and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear nerve. Intensity\n(volume) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated.\nFigure 36.15 The hair cell is a mechanoreceptor with an array of stereocilia emerging from its apical surface. The stereocilia are tethered\ntogether by proteins that open ion channels when the array is bent toward the tallest member of their array, and closed when the array is\nbent toward the shortest member of their array.\nThe hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way. The basilar membrane vibrates in different regions,\naccording to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it. Likewise, the hair cells that lay above it are most sensitive to a\nspecific frequency of sound waves. Hair cells can respond to a small range of similar frequencies, but they require stimulation of\ngreater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their optimal range. The difference in response frequency between adjacent\ninner hair cells is about 0.2 percent. Compare that to adjacent piano strings, which are about six percent different. Place theory,\nwhich is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear, states that high frequency sounds\nselectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port (the oval window). Lower frequencies travel\nfarther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane. The basic pitch-determining mechanism is\nbased on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated. The place theory is the first step toward an\nunderstanding of pitch perception. Considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear, it is thought that there must be\nsome auditory \u201csharpening\u201d mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution.\nWhen sound waves produce fluid waves inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane flexes, bending the stereocilia that attach to\nthe tectorial membrane. Their bending results in action potentials in the hair cells, and auditory information travels along the\nneural endings of the bipolar neurons of the hair cells (collectively, the auditory nerve) to the brain. When the hairs bend, they\nrelease an excitatory neurotransmitter at a synapse with a sensory neuron, which then conducts action potentials to the central\nnervous system. The cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve sends information on hearing. The auditory system\nis very refined, and there is some modulation or \u201csharpening\u201d built in. The brain can send signals back to the cochlea, resulting\nin a change of length in the outer hair cells, sharpening or dampening the hair cells\u2019 response to certain frequencies.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch an animation (http://openstax.org/l/hearing) of sound entering the outer ear, moving through the ear structure,\nstimulating cochlear nerve impulses, and eventually sending signals to the temporal lobe.\nHigher Processing\nThe inner hair cells are most important for conveying auditory information to the brain. About 90 percent of the afferent\nneurons carry information from inner hair cells, with each hair cell synapsing with 10 or so neurons. Outer hair cells connect to\nonly 10 percent of the afferent neurons, and each afferent neuron innervates many hair cells. The afferent, bipolar neurons that\nconvey auditory information travel from the cochlea to the medulla, through the pons and midbrain in the brainstem, finally\nreaching the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe.\n36.4 \u2022 Hearing and Vestibular Sensation\n1033\nVestibular Information\nThe stimuli associated with the vestibular system are linear acceleration (gravity) and angular acceleration and deceleration.\nGravity, acceleration, and deceleration are detected by evaluating the inertia on receptive cells in the vestibular system. Gravity\nis detected through head position. Angular acceleration and deceleration are expressed through turning or tilting of the head.\nThe vestibular system has some similarities with the auditory system. It utilizes hair cells just like the auditory system, but it\nexcites them in different ways. There are five vestibular receptor organs in the inner ear: the utricle, the saccule, and three\nsemicircular canals. Together, they make up what\u2019s known as the vestibular labyrinth that is shown in Figure 36.16. The utricle\nand saccule respond to acceleration in a straight line, such as gravity. The roughly 30,000 hair cells in the utricle and 16,000 hair\ncells in the saccule lie below a gelatinous layer, with their stereocilia projecting into the gelatin. Embedded in this gelatin are\ncalcium carbonate crystals\u2014like tiny rocks. When the head is tilted, the crystals continue to be pulled straight down by gravity,\nbut the new angle of the head causes the gelatin to shift, thereby bending the stereocilia. The bending of the stereocilia\nstimulates the neurons, and they signal to the brain that the head is tilted, allowing the maintenance of balance. It is the\nvestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve that deals with balance.\nFigure 36.16 The structure of the vestibular labyrinth is shown. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nThe fluid-filled semicircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles. They are arranged in three spatial planes. The base of\neach canal has a swelling that contains a cluster of hair cells. The hairs project into a gelatinous cap called the cupula and\nmonitor angular acceleration and deceleration from rotation. They would be stimulated by driving your car around a corner,\nturning your head, or falling forward. One canal lies horizontally, while the other two lie at about 45 degree angles to the\nhorizontal axis, as illustrated in Figure 36.16. When the brain processes input from all three canals together, it can detect\nangular acceleration or deceleration in three dimensions. When the head turns, the fluid in the canals shifts, thereby bending\nstereocilia and sending signals to the brain. Upon cessation accelerating or decelerating\u2014or just moving\u2014the movement of the\nfluid within the canals slows or stops. For example, imagine holding a glass of water. When moving forward, water may splash\nbackwards onto the hand, and when motion has stopped, water may splash forward onto the fingers. While in motion, the\nwater settles in the glass and does not splash. Note that the canals are not sensitive to velocity itself, but to changes in velocity,\nso moving forward at 60mph with your eyes closed would not give the sensation of movement, but suddenly accelerating or\nbraking would stimulate the receptors.\nHigher Processing\nHair cells from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals also communicate through bipolar neurons to the cochlear nucleus\nin the medulla. Cochlear neurons send descending projections to the spinal cord and ascending projections to the pons,\nthalamus, and cerebellum. Connections to the cerebellum are important for coordinated movements. There are also projections\nto the temporal cortex, which account for feelings of dizziness; projections to autonomic nervous system areas in the brainstem,\nwhich account for motion sickness; and projections to the primary somatosensory cortex, which monitors subjective\nmeasurements of the external world and self-movement. People with lesions in the vestibular area of the somatosensory cortex\nsee vertical objects in the world as being tilted. Finally, the vestibular signals project to certain optic muscles to coordinate eye\nand head movements.\n1034\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick through this interactive tutorial (http://openstax.org/l/ear_anatomy) to review the parts of the ear and how they function\nto process sound.\n36.5 Vision\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how electromagnetic waves differ from sound waves\n\u2022\nTrace the path of light through the eye to the point of the optic nerve\n\u2022\nExplain tonic activity as it is manifested in photoreceptors in the retina\nVision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images. Animals are\nbombarded with sensory information, and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic. Fortunately, the visual\nsystems of species have evolved to attend to the most-important stimuli. The importance of vision to humans is further\nsubstantiated by the fact that about one-third of the human cerebral cortex is dedicated to analyzing and perceiving visual\ninformation.\nLight\nAs with auditory stimuli, light travels in waves. The compression waves that compose sound must travel in a medium\u2014a gas, a\nliquid, or a solid. In contrast, light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs no medium; light can travel in a vacuum\n(Figure 36.17). The behavior of light can be discussed in terms of the behavior of waves and also in terms of the behavior of the\nfundamental unit of light\u2014a packet of electromagnetic radiation called a photon. A glance at the electromagnetic spectrum\nshows that visible light for humans is just a small slice of the entire spectrum, which includes radiation that we cannot see as\nlight because it is below the frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible violet light.\nCertain variables are important when discussing perception of light. Wavelength (which varies inversely with frequency)\nmanifests itself as hue. Light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths (and is lower frequency), while light\nat the violet end has shorter wavelengths (and is higher frequency). The wavelength of light is expressed in nanometers (nm); one\nnanometer is one billionth of a meter. Humans perceive light that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740 nm. Some\nother animals, though, can detect wavelengths outside of the human range. For example, bees see near-ultraviolet light in order\nto locate nectar guides on flowers, and some non-avian reptiles sense infrared light (heat that prey gives off).\nFigure 36.17 In the electromagnetic spectrum, visible light lies between 380 nm and 740 nm. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nWave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity, or brightness. The standard unit of intensity of light is the candela, which is\napproximately the luminous intensity of one common candle.\nLight waves travel 299,792 km per second in a vacuum, (and somewhat slower in various media such as air and water), and those\nwaves arrive at the eye as long (red), medium (green), and short (blue) waves. What is termed \u201cwhite light\u201d is light that is\nperceived as white by the human eye. This effect is produced by light that stimulates equally the color receptors in the human\neye. The apparent color of an object is the color (or colors) that the object reflects. Thus a red object reflects the red wavelengths\n36.5 \u2022 Vision\n1035\nin mixed (white) light and absorbs all other wavelengths of light.\nAnatomy of the Eye\nThe photoreceptive cells of the eye, where transduction of light to nervous impulses occurs, are located in the retina (shown in\nFigure 36.18) on the inner surface of the back of the eye. But light does not impinge on the retina unaltered. It passes through\nother layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina (Figure 36.18b). The cornea, the front transparent layer of\nthe eye, and the crystalline lens, a transparent convex structure behind the cornea, both refract (bend) light to focus the image\non the retina. The iris, which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye, is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and\ncornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye. In conditions of high ambient light, the iris contracts, reducing the\nsize of the pupil at its center. In conditions of low light, the iris relaxes and the pupil enlarges.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 36.18 (a) The human eye is shown in cross section. (b) A blowup shows the layers of the retina.\nWhich of the following statements about the human eye is false?\na.\nRods detect color, while cones detect only shades of gray.\nb.\nWhen light enters the retina, it passes the ganglion cells and bipolar cells before reaching photoreceptors at the rear of the\neye.\nc.\nThe iris adjusts the amount of light coming into the eye.\nd.\nThe cornea is a protective layer on the front of the eye.\nThe main function of the lens is to focus light on the retina and fovea centralis. The lens is dynamic, focusing and re-focusing\nlight as the eye rests on near and far objects in the visual field. The lens is operated by muscles that stretch it flat or allow it to\nthicken, changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina. With age comes the loss of the\nflexibility of the lens, and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results. Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses\nbehind the retina. Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that\nis too short. For both defects, images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry. Myopia (nearsightedness) occurs\nwhen an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina. In this case, images in the distance are blurry but\nimages nearby are clear.\nThere are two types of photoreceptors in the retina: rods and cones, named for their general appearance as illustrated in Figure\n36.19. Rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina. They detect dim light and are used\nprimarily for peripheral and nighttime vision. Cones are weakly photosensitive and are located near the center of the retina.\nThey respond to bright light, and their primary role is in daytime, color vision.\n1036\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 36.19 Rods and cones are photoreceptors in the retina. Rods respond in low light and can detect only shades of gray. Cones respond\nin intense light and are responsible for color vision. (credit: modification of work by Piotr Sliwa)\nThe fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision. The fovea has a high density of cones.\nWhen you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light, the eyes orient so that the object\u2019s image falls on the\nfovea. However, when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim light, the object can be better viewed by the\nperipheral vision because it is the rods at the edges of the retina, rather than the cones at the center, that operate better in low\nlight. In humans, cones far outnumber rods in the fovea.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReview the anatomical structure (http://openstax.org/l/eye_diagram) of the eye, clicking on each part to practice identification.\nTransduction of Light\nThe rods and cones are the site of transduction of light to a neural signal. Both rods and cones contain photopigments. In\nvertebrates, the main photopigment, rhodopsin, has two main parts (Figure 36.20): an opsin, which is a membrane protein (in\nthe form of a cluster of \u03b1-helices that span the membrane), and retinal\u2014a molecule that absorbs light. When light hits a\nphotoreceptor, it causes a shape change in the retinal, altering its structure from a bent (cis) form of the molecule to its linear\n(trans) isomer. This isomerization of retinal activates the rhodopsin, starting a cascade of events that ends with the closing of\nNa+ channels in the membrane of the photoreceptor. Thus, unlike most other sensory neurons (which become depolarized by\nexposure to a stimulus) visual receptors become hyperpolarized and thus driven away from threshold (Figure 36.21).\n36.5 \u2022 Vision\n1037\nFigure 36.20 (a) Rhodopsin, the photoreceptor in vertebrates, has two parts: the trans-membrane protein opsin, and retinal. When light\nstrikes retinal, it changes shape from (b) a cis to a trans form. The signal is passed to a G-protein called transducin, triggering a series of\ndownstream events.\n1038\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 36.21 When light strikes rhodopsin, the G-protein transducin is activated, which in turn activates phosphodiesterase.\nPhosphodiesterase converts cGMP to GMP, thereby closing sodium channels. As a result, the membrane becomes hyperpolarized. The\nhyperpolarized membrane does not release glutamate to the bipolar cell.\nTrichromatic Coding\nThere are three types of cones (with different photopsins), and they differ in the wavelength to which they are most responsive,\nas shown in Figure 36.22. Some cones are maximally responsive to short light waves of 420 nm, so they are called S cones (\u201cS\u201d for\n\u201cshort\u201d); others respond maximally to waves of 530 nm (M cones, for \u201cmedium\u201d); a third group responds maximally to light of\nlonger wavelengths, at 560 nm (L, or \u201clong\u201d cones). With only one type of cone, color vision would not be possible, and a two-\ncone (dichromatic) system has limitations. Primates use a three-cone (trichromatic) system, resulting in full color vision.\nThe color we perceive is a result of the ratio of activity of our three types of cones. The colors of the visual spectrum, running\nfrom long-wavelength light to short, are red (700 nm), orange (600 nm), yellow (565 nm), green (497 nm), blue (470 nm), indigo\n(450 nm), and violet (425 nm). Humans have very sensitive perception of color and can distinguish about 500 levels of\nbrightness, 200 different hues, and 20 steps of saturation, or about 2 million distinct colors.\n36.5 \u2022 Vision\n1039\nFigure 36.22 Human rod cells and the different types of cone cells each have an optimal wavelength. However, there is considerable\noverlap in the wavelengths of light detected.\nRetinal Processing\nVisual signals leave the cones and rods, travel to the bipolar cells, and then to ganglion cells. A large degree of processing of\nvisual information occurs in the retina itself, before visual information is sent to the brain.\nPhotoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity. That is, they are always slightly active even when not\nstimulated by light. In neurons that exhibit tonic activity, the absence of stimuli maintains a firing rate at a baseline; while some\nstimuli increase firing rate from the baseline, and other stimuli decrease firing rate. In the absence of light, the bipolar neurons\nthat connect rods and cones to ganglion cells are continuously and actively inhibited by the rods and cones. Exposure of the\nretina to light hyperpolarizes the rods and cones and removes their inhibition of bipolar cells. The now active bipolar cells in turn\nstimulate the ganglion cells, which send action potentials along their axons (which leave the eye as the optic nerve). Thus, the\nvisual system relies on change in retinal activity, rather than the absence or presence of activity, to encode visual signals for the\nbrain. Sometimes horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other photoreceptors and to several bipolar cells. When a\nrod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell, the horizontal cell inhibits more distant photoreceptors and bipolar cells, creating\nlateral inhibition. This inhibition sharpens edges and enhances contrast in the images by making regions receiving light appear\nlighter and dark surroundings appear darker. Amacrine cells can distribute information from one bipolar cell to many ganglion\ncells.\nYou can demonstrate this using an easy demonstration to \u201ctrick\u201d your retina and brain about the colors you are observing in\nyour visual field. Look fixedly at Figure 36.23 for about 45 seconds. Then quickly shift your gaze to a sheet of blank white paper or\na white wall. You should see an afterimage of the Norwegian flag in its correct colors. At this point, close your eyes for a\nmoment, then reopen them, looking again at the white paper or wall; the afterimage of the flag should continue to appear as\nred, white, and blue. What causes this? According to an explanation called opponent process theory, as you gazed fixedly at the\ngreen, black, and yellow flag, your retinal ganglion cells that respond positively to green, black, and yellow increased their firing\ndramatically. When you shifted your gaze to the neutral white ground, these ganglion cells abruptly decreased their activity and\nthe brain interpreted this abrupt downshift as if the ganglion cells were responding now to their \u201copponent\u201d colors: red, white,\nand blue, respectively, in the visual field. Once the ganglion cells return to their baseline activity state, the false perception of\ncolor will disappear.\n1040\nChapter 36 \u2022 Sensory Systems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 36.23 View this flag to understand how retinal processing works. Stare at the center of the flag (indicated by the white dot) for 45\nseconds, and then quickly look at a white background, noticing how colors appear.\nHigher Processing\nThe myelinated axons of ganglion cells make up the optic nerves. Within the nerves, different axons carry different qualities of\nthe visual signal. Some axons constitute the magnocellular (big cell) pathway, which carries information about form, movement,\ndepth, and differences in brightness. Other axons constitute the parvocellular (small cell) pathway, which carries information on\ncolor and fine detail. Some visual information projects directly back into the brain, while other information crosses to the\nopposite side of the brain. This crossing of optical pathways produces the distinctive optic chiasma (Greek, for \u201ccrossing\u201d) found\nat the base of the brain and allows us to coordinate information from both eyes.\nOnce in the brain, visual information is processed in several places, and its routes reflect the complexity and importance of\nvisual information to humans and other animals. One route takes the signals to the thalamus, which serves as the routing\nstation for all incoming sensory impulses except olfaction. In the thalamus, the magnocellular and parvocellular distinctions\nremain intact, and there are different layers of the thalamus dedicated to each. When visual signals leave the thalamus, they\ntravel to the primary visual cortex at the rear of the brain. From the visual cortex, the visual signals travel in two directions. One\nstream that projects to the parietal lobe, in the side of the brain, carries magnocellular (\u201cwhere\u201d) information. A second stream\nprojects to the temporal lobe and carries both magnocellular (\u201cwhere\u201d) and parvocellular (\u201cwhat\u201d) information.\nAnother important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain, where eye movements\nare coordinated and integrated with auditory information. Finally, there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body\u2019s internal clock, which controls\nour circadian (day-long) cycle. The SCN sends information to the pineal gland, which is important in sleep/wake patterns and\nannual cycles.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView this interactive presentation (http://openstax.org/l/sense_of_sight) to review what you have learned about how vision\nfunctions.\n36.5 \u2022 Vision\n1041\n", "key_terms": "\naudition\nsense of hearing\nbasilar membrane\nstiff structure in the cochlea that\nindirectly anchors auditory receptors\nbipolar neuron\nneuron with two processes from the cell\nbody, typically in opposite directions\ncandela\n(cd) unit of measurement of luminous intensity\n(brightness)\ncircadian\ndescribes a time cycle about one day in length\ncochlea\nwhorled structure that contains receptors for\ntransduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical\nsignal\ncone\nweakly photosensitive, chromatic, cone-shaped\nneuron in the fovea of the retina that detects bright light\nand is used in daytime color vision\ncornea\ntransparent layer over the front of the eye that helps\nfocus light waves\nfovea\nregion in the center of the retina with a high density\nof photoreceptors and which is responsible for acute\nvision\nfree nerve ending\nending of an afferent neuron that lacks a\nspecialized structure for detection of sensory stimuli;\nsome respond to touch, pain, or temperature\nglabrous\ndescribes the non-hairy skin found on palms and\nfingers, soles of feet, and lips of humans and other\nprimates\nglomerulus\nin the olfactory bulb, one of the two neural\nclusters that receives signals from one type of olfactory\nreceptor\nGolgi tendon organ\nmuscular proprioceptive tension\nreceptor that provides the sensory component of the\nGolgi tendon reflex\ngustation\nsense of taste\nhyperopia\n(also, farsightedness) visual defect in which the\nimage focus falls behind the retina, thereby making\nimages in the distance clear, but close-up images blurry\nincus\n(also, anvil) second of the three bones of the middle\near\ninner ear\ninnermost part of the ear;

Perception is an\nindividual interpretation of a sensation and is a brain\nfunction. Humans have special senses: olfaction, gustation,\nequilibrium, and hearing, plus the general senses of\nsomatosensation.\nSensory receptors are either specialized cells associated with\nsensory neurons or the specialized ends of sensory neurons\nthat are a part of the peripheral nervous system, and they are\nused to receive information about the environment (internal\nor external). Each sensory receptor is modified for the type\nof stimulus it detects. For example, neither gustatory\nreceptors nor auditory receptors are sensitive to light. Each\nsensory receptor is responsive to stimuli within a specific\nregion in space, which is known as that receptor\u2019s receptive\nfield. The most fundamental function of a sensory system is\nthe translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in\nthe nervous system.\nAll sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system,\nenter the central nervous system and are routed to the\nthalamus. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is\nconducted to the specific area of the cortex dedicated to\nprocessing that particular sense.\n36.2 Somatosensation\nSomatosensation includes all sensation received from the\nskin and mucous membranes, as well as from the limbs and\njoints. Somatosensation occurs all over the exterior of the\nbody and at some interior locations as well, and a variety of\nreceptor types, embedded in the skin and mucous\nmembranes, play a role.\nThere are several types of specialized sensory receptors.\nRapidly adapting free nerve endings detect nociception, hot\nand cold, and light touch. Slowly adapting, encapsulated\nMerkel\u2019s disks are found in fingertips and lips, and respond\nto light touch. Meissner\u2019s corpuscles, found in glabrous skin,\nare rapidly adapting, encapsulated receptors that detect\ntouch, low-frequency vibration, and flutter. Ruffini endings\nare slowly adapting, encapsulated receptors that detect skin\nstretch, joint activity, and warmth. Hair receptors are rapidly\nadapting nerve endings wrapped around the base of hair\nfollicles that detect hair movement and skin deflection.\nFinally, Pacinian corpuscles are encapsulated, rapidly\nadapting receptors that detect transient pressure and high-\nfrequency vibration.\n36.3 Taste and Smell\nThere are five primary tastes in humans: sweet, sour, bitter,\nsalty, and umami. Each taste has its own receptor type that\nresponds only to that taste. Tastants enter the body and are\nChapter 36 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n1043\ndissolved in saliva. Taste cells are located within taste buds,\nwhich are found on three of the four types of papillae in the\nmouth.\nRegarding olfaction, there are many thousands of odorants,\nbut humans detect only about 10,000. Like taste receptors,\nolfactory receptors are each responsive to only one odorant.\nOdorants dissolve in nasal mucosa, where they excite their\ncorresponding olfactory sensory cells. When these cells\ndetect an odorant, they send their signals to the main\nolfactory bulb and then to other locations in the brain,\nincluding the olfactory cortex.\n36.4 Hearing and Vestibular\nSensation\nAudition is important for territory defense, predation,\npredator defense, and communal exchanges. The vestibular\nsystem, which is not auditory, detects linear acceleration and\nangular acceleration and deceleration. Both the auditory\nsystem and vestibular system use hair cells as their\nreceptors.\nAuditory stimuli are sound waves. The sound wave energy\nreaches the outer ear (pinna, canal, tympanum), and\nvibrations of the tympanum send the energy to the middle\near. The middle ear bones shift and the stapes transfers\nmechanical energy to the oval window of the fluid-filled\ninner ear cochlea. Once in the cochlea, the energy causes the\nbasilar membrane to flex, thereby bending the stereocilia on\nreceptor hair cells. This activates the receptors, which send\ntheir auditory neural signals to the brain.\nThe vestibular system has five parts that work together to\nprovide the sense of direction, thus helping to maintain\nbalance. The utricle and saccule measure head orientation:\ntheir calcium carbonate crystals shift when the head is tilted,\nthereby activating hair cells. The semicircular canals work\nsimilarly, such that when the head is turned, the fluid in the\ncanals bends stereocilia on hair cells. The vestibular hair cells\nalso send signals to the thalamus and to the somatosensory\ncortex, but also to the cerebellum, the structure above the\nbrainstem that plays a large role in timing and coordination\nof movement.\n36.5 Vision\nVision is the only photo responsive sense. Visible light travels\nin waves and is a very small slice of the electromagnetic\nradiation spectrum. Light waves differ based on their\nfrequency (wavelength = hue) and amplitude (intensity =\nbrightness).\nIn the vertebrate retina, there are two types of light receptors\n(photoreceptors): cones and rods. Cones, which are the\nsource of color vision, exist in three forms\u2014L, M, and\nS\u2014and they are differentially sensitive to different\nwavelengths. Cones are located in the retina, along with the\ndim-light, achromatic receptors (rods). Cones are found in\nthe fovea, the central region of the retina, whereas rods are\nfound in the peripheral regions of the retina.\nVisual signals travel from the eye over the axons of retinal\nganglion cells, which make up the optic nerves. Ganglion\ncells come in several versions. Some ganglion cell axons carry\ninformation on form, movement, depth, and brightness,\nwhile other axons carry information on color and fine detail.\nVisual information is sent to the superior colliculi in the\nmidbrain, where coordination of eye movements and\nintegration of auditory information takes place. Visual\ninformation is also sent to the suprachiasmatic nucleus\n(SCN) of the hypothalamus, which plays a role in the\ncircadian cycle.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

Hormones are released into body fluids (usually\nblood) that carry these chemicals to their target cells. At the target cells, which are cells that have a receptor\nfor a signal or ligand from a signal cell, the hormones elicit a response. The cells, tissues, and organs that\nsecrete hormones make up the endocrine system. Examples of glands of the endocrine system include the\nadrenal glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses\nto stress, and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates.\nAlthough there are many different hormones in the human body, they can be divided into three classes based\non their chemical structure: lipid-derived, amino acid-derived, and peptide (peptide and proteins)\nhormones. One of the key distinguishing features of lipid-derived hormones is that they can diffuse across\nplasma membranes whereas the amino acid-derived and peptide hormones cannot.\nFigure 37.1 The process of amphibian metamorphosis, as seen in the tadpole-to-frog stages\nshown here, is driven by hormones. (credit \"tadpole\": modification of work by Brian Gratwicke)\nINTRODUCTION An animal\u2019s endocrine system controls body processes through the production,\nsecretion, and regulation of hormones, which serve as chemical \u201cmessengers\u201d functioning in cellular and\norgan activity and, ultimately, maintaining the body\u2019s homeostasis. The endocrine system plays a role in\ngrowth, metabolism, and sexual development. In humans, common endocrine system diseases include\nthyroid disease and diabetes mellitus. In organisms that undergo metamorphosis, the process is\ncontrolled by the endocrine system. The transformation from tadpole to frog, for example, is complex\nand nuanced to adapt to specific environments and ecological circumstances.\nChapter Outline\n37.1 Types of Hormones\n37.2 How Hormones\nWork\n37.3 Regulation of Body\nProcesses\n37.4 Regulation of\nHormone\nProduction\n37.5 Endocrine Glands\nLipid-Derived Hormones (or Lipid-soluble Hormones)\nMost lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it, as illustrated in\nFigure 37.2. The primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones. Chemically, these\nhormones are usually ketones or alcohols; their chemical names will end in \u201c-ol\u201d for alcohols or \u201c-one\u201d for\nketones. Examples of steroid hormones include estradiol, which is an estrogen, or female sex hormone, and\ntestosterone, which is an androgen, or male sex hormone. These two hormones are released by the female\nand male reproductive organs, respectively. Other steroid hormones include aldosterone and cortisol, which\nare released by the adrenal glands along with some other types of androgens. Steroid hormones are\ninsoluble in water, and they are transported by transport proteins in blood. As a result, they remain in\ncirculation longer than peptide hormones. For example, cortisol has a half-life of 60 to 90 minutes, while\nepinephrine, an amino acid derived-hormone, has a half-life of approximately one minute.\nFigure 37.2 The structures shown here represent (a) cholesterol, plus the steroid hormones (b) testosterone and (c)\nestradiol.\nAmino Acid-Derived Hormones\nThe amino acid-derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids\ntyrosine and tryptophan, shown in Figure 37.3. If a hormone is amino acid-derived, its chemical name will\nend in \u201c-ine\u201d. Examples of amino acid-derived hormones include epinephrine and norepinephrine, which\nare synthesized in the medulla of the adrenal glands, and thyroxine, which is produced by the thyroid gland.\nThe pineal gland in the brain makes and secretes melatonin which regulates sleep cycles.\n1050\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 37.3 (a) The hormone epinephrine, which triggers the fight-or-flight response, is derived from the amino acid tyrosine. (b) The\nhormone melatonin, which regulates circadian rhythms, is derived from the amino acid tryptophan.\nPeptide Hormones\nThe structure of peptide hormones is that of a polypeptide chain (chain of amino acids). The peptide hormones include\nmolecules that are short polypeptide chains, such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in the brain and released into\nthe blood in the posterior pituitary gland. This class also includes small proteins, like growth hormones produced by the\npituitary, and large glycoproteins such as follicle-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary. Figure 37.4 illustrates these\npeptide hormones.\nSecreted peptides like insulin are stored within vesicles in the cells that synthesize them. They are then released in response to\nstimuli such as high blood glucose levels in the case of insulin. Amino acid-derived and polypeptide hormones are water-soluble\nand insoluble in lipids. These hormones cannot pass through plasma membranes of cells; therefore, their receptors are found on\nthe surface of the target cells.\nFigure 37.4 The structures of peptide hormones (a) oxytocin, (b) growth hormone, and (c) follicle-stimulating hormone are shown. These\npeptide hormones are much larger than those derived from cholesterol or amino acids.\n37.1 \u2022 Types of Hormones\n1051\nCAREER CONNECTION\nEndocrinologist\nAn endocrinologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the endocrine glands, hormone systems, and\nglucose and lipid metabolic pathways. An endocrine surgeon specializes in the surgical treatment of endocrine diseases and\nglands. Some of the diseases that are managed by endocrinologists: disorders of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus), disorders of\nthe pituitary (gigantism, acromegaly, and pituitary dwarfism), disorders of the thyroid gland (goiter and Graves\u2019 disease), and\ndisorders of the adrenal glands (Cushing\u2019s disease and Addison\u2019s disease).\nEndocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through extensive use of laboratory tests.\nMany endocrine diseases are diagnosed using tests that stimulate or suppress endocrine organ functioning. Blood samples are\nthen drawn to determine the effect of stimulating or suppressing an endocrine organ on the production of hormones. For\nexample, to diagnose diabetes mellitus, patients are required to fast for 12 to 24 hours. They are then given a sugary drink, which\nstimulates the pancreas to produce insulin to decrease blood glucose levels. A blood sample is taken one to two hours after the\nsugar drink is consumed. If the pancreas is functioning properly, the blood glucose level will be within a normal range. Another\nexample is the A1C test, which can be performed during blood screening. The A1C test measures average blood glucose levels\nover the past two to three months by examining how well the blood glucose is being managed over a long time.\nOnce a disease has been diagnosed, endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes and/or medications to treat the disease.\nSome cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise, weight loss, and a healthy diet; in other cases, medications may be\nrequired to enhance insulin release. If the disease cannot be controlled by these means, the endocrinologist may prescribe\ninsulin injections.\nIn addition to clinical practice, endocrinologists may also be involved in primary research and development activities. For\nexample, ongoing islet transplant research is investigating how healthy pancreas islet cells may be transplanted into diabetic\npatients. Successful islet transplants may allow patients to stop taking insulin injections.\n37.2 How Hormones Work\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how hormones work\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of different types of hormone receptors\nHormones mediate changes in target cells by binding to specific hormone receptors. In this way, even though hormones\ncirculate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the\nnecessary receptors. Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on many different cells or may be limited to a small number\nof specialized cells. For example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic activity\nthroughout the body. Cells can have many receptors for the same hormone but often also possess receptors for different types of\nhormones. The number of receptors that respond to a hormone determines the cell\u2019s sensitivity to that hormone, and the\nresulting cellular response. Additionally, the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time, resulting in\nincreased or decreased cell sensitivity. In up-regulation, the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels,\nmaking the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity. When the number of receptors decreases\nin response to rising hormone levels, called down-regulation, cellular activity is reduced.\nReceptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes. Depending on the\nlocation of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone, hormones can mediate changes\ndirectly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and modulating gene transcription, or indirectly by binding to cell\nsurface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways.\nIntracellular Hormone Receptors\nLipid-derived (soluble) hormones such as steroid hormones diffuse across the membranes of the endocrine cell. Once outside\nthe cell, they bind to transport proteins that keep them soluble in the bloodstream. At the target cell, the hormones are released\nfrom the carrier protein and diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane of cells. The steroid hormones pass through\nthe plasma membrane of a target cell and adhere to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. The cell\nsignaling pathways induced by the steroid hormones regulate specific genes on the cell's DNA. The hormones and receptor\n1052\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncomplex act as transcription regulators by increasing or decreasing the synthesis of mRNA molecules of specific genes. This, in\nturn, determines the amount of corresponding protein that is synthesized by altering gene expression. This protein can be used\neither to change the structure of the cell or to produce enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions. In this way, the steroid\nhormone regulates specific cell processes as illustrated in Figure 37.5.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 37.5 An intracellular nuclear receptor (NR) is located in the cytoplasm bound to a heat shock protein (HSP). Upon hormone binding,\nthe receptor dissociates from the heat shock protein and translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the hormone-receptor complex binds\nto a DNA sequence called a hormone response element (HRE), which triggers gene transcription and translation. The corresponding protein\nproduct can then mediate changes in cell function.\nHeat shock proteins (HSP) are so named because they help refold misfolded proteins. In response to increased temperature (a\n\u201cheat shock\u201d), heat shock proteins are activated by release from the NR/HSP complex. At the same time, transcription of HSP\ngenes is activated. Why do you think the cell responds to a heat shock by increasing the activity of proteins that help refold\nmisfolded proteins?\nOther lipid-soluble hormones that are not steroid hormones, such as vitamin D and thyroxine, have receptors located in the\nnucleus. While thyroxine is mostly hydrophobic, its passage across the membrane is dependent on transporter protein. Vitamin\nD diffuses across both the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope. Once in the cell, both hormones bind to receptors in the\nnucleus. The hormone-receptor complex stimulates transcription of specific genes.\nPlasma Membrane Hormone Receptors\nAmino acid-derived hormones (with the exception of thyroxine) and polypeptide hormones are not lipid-derived (lipid-soluble)\nand therefore cannot diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells. Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer\nsurface of the plasma membrane, via plasma membrane hormone receptors. Unlike steroid hormones, lipid insoluble\nhormones do not directly affect the target cell because they cannot enter the cell and act directly on DNA. Binding of these\nhormones to a cell surface receptor results in activation of a signaling pathway; this triggers intracellular activity and carries out\nthe specific effects associated with the hormone. In this way, nothing passes through the cell membrane; the hormone that\nbinds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell. The hormone that\ninitiates the signaling pathway is called a first messenger, which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm, as illustrated in\nFigure 37.6.\n37.2 \u2022 How Hormones Work\n1053\nFigure 37.6 The amino acid-derived hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine bind to beta-adrenergic receptors on the plasma\nmembrane of cells. Hormone binding to receptor activates a G-protein, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase, converting ATP to cAMP.\ncAMP is a second messenger that mediates a cell-specific response. An enzyme called phosphodiesterase breaks down cAMP, terminating\nthe signal.\nOne very important second messenger is cyclic AMP (cAMP). When a hormone binds to its membrane receptor, a G-protein that\nis associated with the receptor is activated; G-proteins are proteins separate from receptors that are found in the cell membrane.\nWhen a hormone is not bound to the receptor, the G-protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine diphosphate, or GDP. When a\nhormone binds to the receptor, the G-protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate, or GTP, in place of GDP. After\nbinding, GTP is hydrolysed by the G-protein into GDP and becomes inactive.\nThe activated G-protein in turn activates a membrane-bound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the\nconversion of ATP to cAMP. cAMP, in turn, activates a group of proteins called protein kinases, which transfer a phosphate\ngroup from ATP to a substrate molecule in a process called phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of a substrate molecule\nchanges its structural orientation, thereby activating it. These activated molecules can then mediate changes in cellular\nprocesses.\nThe effect of a hormone is amplified as the signaling pathway progresses. The binding of a hormone at a single receptor causes\nthe activation of many G-proteins, which activates adenylyl cyclase. Each molecule of adenylyl cyclase then triggers the\nformation of many molecules of cAMP. Further amplification occurs as protein kinases, once activated by cAMP, can catalyze\nmany reactions. In this way, a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular product. To stop\nhormone activity, cAMP is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme phosphodiesterase, or PDE. PDE is always present in the cell\nand breaks down cAMP to control hormone activity, preventing overproduction of cellular products.\nThe specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the cell\nmembrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm. Cellular responses to hormone binding of a receptor\ninclude altering membrane permeability and metabolic pathways, stimulating synthesis of proteins and enzymes, and\nactivating hormone release.\n37.3 Regulation of Body Processes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how hormones regulate the excretory system\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of hormones in the reproductive system\n\u2022\nDescribe how hormones regulate metabolism\n\u2022\nExplain the role of hormones in different diseases\n1054\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nHormones have a wide range of effects and modulate many different body processes. The key regulatory processes that will be\nexamined here are those affecting the excretory system, the reproductive system, metabolism, blood calcium concentrations,\ngrowth, and the stress response.\nHormonal Regulation of the Excretory System\nMaintaining a proper water balance in the body is important to avoid dehydration or over-hydration (hyponatremia). The water\nconcentration of the body is monitored by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which detect the concentration of electrolytes in\nthe extracellular fluid. The concentration of electrolytes in the blood rises when there is water loss caused by excessive\nperspiration, inadequate water intake, or low blood volume due to blood loss. An increase in blood electrolyte levels results in a\nneuronal signal being sent from the osmoreceptors in hypothalamic nuclei. The pituitary gland has two components: anterior\nand posterior. The anterior pituitary is composed of glandular cells that secrete protein hormones. The posterior pituitary is an\nextension of the hypothalamus. It is composed largely of neurons that are continuous with the hypothalamus.\nThe hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is transported to and\nreleased from the posterior pituitary gland. The principal action of ADH is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the\nkidneys. As ADH (which is also known as vasopressin) causes direct water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, salts and\nwastes are concentrated in what will eventually be excreted as urine. The hypothalamus controls the mechanisms of ADH\nsecretion, either by regulating blood volume or the concentration of water in the blood. Dehydration or physiological stress can\ncause an increase of osmolarity above 300 mOsm/L, which in turn, raises ADH secretion and water will be retained, causing an\nincrease in blood pressure. ADH travels in the bloodstream to the kidneys. Once at the kidneys, ADH changes the kidneys to\nbecome more permeable to water by temporarily inserting water channels, aquaporins, into the kidney tubules. Water moves\nout of the kidney tubules through the aquaporins, reducing urine volume. The water is reabsorbed into the capillaries lowering\nblood osmolarity back toward normal. As blood osmolarity decreases, a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor\nactivity in the hypothalamus, and ADH secretion is reduced. ADH release can be reduced by certain substances, including\nalcohol, which can cause increased urine production and dehydration.\nChronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in diabetes insipidus. If the posterior pituitary\ndoes not release enough ADH, water cannot be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine. This causes increased thirst, but\nwater taken in is lost again and must be continually consumed. If the condition is not severe, dehydration may not occur, but\nsevere cases can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration.\nAnother hormone responsible for maintaining electrolyte concentrations in extracellular fluids is aldosterone, a steroid\nhormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex. In contrast to ADH, which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain\nproper water balance, aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion from\nextracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules. Because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the\nconcentrations of minerals Na+and K+, aldosterone is referred to as a mineralocorticoid, a corticosteroid that affects ion and\nwater balance. Aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels, blood volume, or blood pressure, or an\nincrease in blood potassium levels. It also prevents the loss of Na+ from sweat, saliva, and gastric juice. The reabsorption of Na+\nalso results in the osmotic reabsorption of water, which alters blood volume and blood pressure.\nAldosterone production can be stimulated by low blood pressure, which triggers a sequence of chemical release, as illustrated in\nFigure 37.7. When blood pressure drops, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated. Cells in the\njuxtaglomerular apparatus, which regulates the functions of the nephrons of the kidney, detect this and release renin. Renin, an\nenzyme, circulates in the blood and reacts with a plasma protein produced by the liver called angiotensinogen. When\nangiotensinogen is cleaved by renin, it produces angiotensin I, which is then converted into angiotensin II in the lungs.\nAngiotensin II functions as a hormone and then causes the release of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, resulting\nin increased Na+ reabsorption, water retention, and an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II in addition to being a potent\nvasoconstrictor also causes an increase in ADH and increased thirst, both of which help to raise blood pressure.\n37.3 \u2022 Regulation of Body Processes\n1055\nFigure 37.7 ADH and aldosterone increase blood pressure and volume. Angiotensin II stimulates release of these hormones. Angiotensin\nII, in turn, is formed when renin cleaves angiotensinogen. (credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nHormonal Regulation of the Reproductive System\nRegulation of the reproductive system is a process that requires the action of hormones from the pituitary gland, the adrenal\ncortex, and the gonads. During puberty in both males and females, the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone (GnRH), which stimulates the production and release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone\n(LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones regulate the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females) and\ntherefore are called gonadotropins. In both males and females, FSH stimulates gamete production and LH stimulates\nproduction of hormones by the gonads. An increase in gonad hormone levels inhibits GnRH production through a negative\nfeedback loop.\nRegulation of the Male Reproductive System\nIn males, FSH stimulates the maturation of sperm cells. FSH production is inhibited by the hormone inhibin, which is released\nby the testes. LH stimulates production of the sex hormones (androgens) by the interstitial cells of the testes and therefore is\nalso called interstitial cell-stimulating hormone.\nThe most widely known androgen in males is testosterone. Testosterone promotes the production of sperm and masculine\ncharacteristics. The adrenal cortex also produces small amounts of testosterone precursor, although the role of this additional\nhormone production is not fully understood.\nEveryday Connection\nThe Dangers of Synthetic Hormones\n1056\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nRegulation of the Female Reproductive System\nIn females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. Follicle cells produce\nthe hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production. LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of ovulation, and\nstimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries, as illustrated in Figure 37.9. Estradiol and progesterone are\nsteroid hormones that prepare the body for pregnancy. Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both\nestradiol and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle.\nFigure 37.8 Professional baseball player Jason Giambi publically admitted to, and apologized for, his use of anabolic steroids supplied\nby a trainer. (credit: Bryce Edwards)\nSome athletes attempt to boost their performance by using artificial hormones that enhance muscle performance. Anabolic\nsteroids, a form of the male sex hormone testosterone, are one of the most widely known performance-enhancing drugs.\nSteroids are used to help build muscle mass. Other hormones that are used to enhance athletic performance include\nerythropoietin, which triggers the production of red blood cells, and human growth hormone, which can help in building\nmuscle mass. Most performance enhancing drugs are illegal for nonmedical purposes. They are also banned by national and\ninternational governing bodies including the International Olympic Committee, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the National\nCollegiate Athletic Association, the Major League Baseball, and the National Football League.\nThe side effects of synthetic hormones are often significant and nonreversible, and in some cases, fatal. Androgens produce\nseveral complications such as liver dysfunctions and liver tumors, prostate gland enlargement, difficulty urinating,\npremature closure of epiphyseal cartilages, testicular atrophy, infertility, and immune system depression. The physiological\nstrain caused by these substances is often greater than what the body can handle, leading to unpredictable and dangerous\neffects and linking their use to heart attacks, strokes, and impaired cardiac function.\n37.3 \u2022 Regulation of Body Processes\n1057\nFigure 37.9 Hormonal regulation of the female reproductive system involves hormones from the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries.\nIn addition to producing FSH and LH, the anterior portion of the pituitary gland also produces the hormone prolactin (PRL) in\nfemales. Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth. Prolactin levels are regulated\nby the hypothalamic hormones prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) and prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH), which is now\nknown to be dopamine. PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it.\nThe posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth. The uterine\nsmooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus\npeaks. Stretching of tissues in the uterus and cervix stimulates oxytocin release during childbirth. Contractions increase in\nintensity as blood levels of oxytocin rise via a positive feedback mechanism until the birth is complete. Oxytocin also stimulates\nthe contraction of myoepithelial cells around the milk-producing mammary glands. As these cells contract, milk is forced from\nthe secretory alveoli into milk ducts and is ejected from the breasts in milk ejection (\u201clet-down\u201d) reflex. Oxytocin release is\nstimulated by the suckling of an infant, which triggers the synthesis of oxytocin in the hypothalamus and its release into\ncirculation at the posterior pituitary.\nHormonal Regulation of Metabolism\nBlood glucose levels vary widely over the course of a day as periods of food consumption alternate with periods of fasting.\nInsulin and glucagon are the two hormones primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis of blood glucose levels.\n1058\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nAdditional regulation is mediated by the thyroid hormones.\nRegulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Insulin and Glucagon\nCells of the body require nutrients in order to function, and these nutrients are obtained through feeding. In order to manage\nnutrient intake, storing excess intake and utilizing reserves when necessary, the body uses hormones to moderate energy stores.\nInsulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, which are stimulated to release insulin as blood glucose levels rise (for\nexample, after a meal is consumed). Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by enhancing the rate of glucose uptake and utilization\nby target cells, which use glucose for ATP production. It also stimulates the liver to convert glucose to glycogen, which is then\nstored by cells for later use. Insulin also increases glucose transport into certain cells, such as muscle cells and the liver. This\nresults from an insulin-mediated increase in the number of glucose transporter proteins in cell membranes, which remove\nglucose from circulation by facilitated diffusion. As insulin binds to its target cell via insulin receptors and signal transduction,\nit triggers the cell to incorporate glucose transport proteins into its membrane. This allows glucose to enter the cell, where it can\nbe used as an energy source. However, this does not occur in all cells: some cells, including those in the kidneys and brain, can\naccess glucose without the use of insulin. Insulin also stimulates the conversion of glucose to fat in adipocytes and the synthesis\nof proteins. These actions mediated by insulin cause blood glucose concentrations to fall, called a hypoglycemic \u201clow sugar\u201d\neffect, which inhibits further insulin release from beta cells through a negative feedback loop.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis animation describes the role of insulin and the pancreas in diabetes.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/insulin)\nImpaired insulin function can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus, the main symptoms of which are illustrated in Figure\n37.10. This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas, or by reduced sensitivity of tissue\ncells to insulin. This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells, causing high levels of blood glucose, or hyperglycemia (high\nsugar). High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine, resulting in\nglucose being lost in urine. High glucose levels also result in less water being reabsorbed by the kidneys, causing high amounts\nof urine to be produced; this may result in dehydration. Over time, high blood glucose levels can cause nerve damage to the eyes\nand peripheral body tissues, as well as damage to the kidneys and cardiovascular system. Oversecretion of insulin can cause\nhypoglycemia, low blood glucose levels. This causes insufficient glucose availability to cells, often leading to muscle weakness,\nand can sometimes cause unconsciousness or death if left untreated.\nFigure 37.10 The main symptoms of diabetes are shown. (credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nWhen blood glucose levels decline below normal levels, for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during\nexercise, the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas. Glucagon raises blood glucose levels, eliciting\nwhat is called a hyperglycemic effect, by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells\nin a process called glycogenolysis. Glucose can then be utilized as energy by muscle cells and released into circulation by the\nliver cells. Glucagon also stimulates absorption of amino acids from the blood by the liver, which then converts them to glucose.\nThis process of glucose synthesis is called gluconeogenesis. Glucagon also stimulates adipose cells to release fatty acids into the\n37.3 \u2022 Regulation of Body Processes\n1059\nblood. These actions mediated by glucagon result in an increase in blood glucose levels to normal homeostatic levels. Rising\nblood glucose levels inhibit further glucagon release by the pancreas via a negative feedback mechanism. In this way, insulin and\nglucagon work together to maintain homeostatic glucose levels, as shown in Figure 37.11.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 37.11 Insulin and glucagon regulate blood glucose levels.\nPancreatic tumors may cause excess secretion of glucagon. Type I diabetes results from the failure of the pancreas to produce\ninsulin. Which of the following statement about these two conditions is true?\na.\nA pancreatic tumor and type I diabetes will have the opposite effects on blood sugar levels.\nb.\nA pancreatic tumor and type I diabetes will both cause hyperglycemia.\nc.\nA pancreatic tumor and type I diabetes will both cause hypoglycemia.\nd.\nBoth pancreatic tumors and type I diabetes result in the inability of cells to take up glucose.\nRegulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Thyroid Hormones\nThe basal metabolic rate, which is the amount of calories required by the body at rest, is determined by two hormones produced\nby the thyroid gland: thyroxine, also known as tetraiodothyronine or T4, and triiodothyronine, also known as T3. These\nhormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult brain, uterus, testes, blood cells, and spleen. They are\ntransported across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to receptors on the mitochondria resulting in increased ATP\nproduction. In the nucleus, T3and T4activate genes involved in energy production and glucose oxidation. This results in\nincreased rates of metabolism and body heat production, which is known as the hormone\u2019s calorigenic effect.\nT3and T4release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the anterior\npituitary. TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of T3 and T4 from a glycoprotein\ncalled thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is present in the follicles of the thyroid, and is converted into thyroid hormones with the\naddition of iodine. Iodine is formed from iodide ions that are actively transported into the thyroid follicle from the bloodstream.\nA peroxidase enzyme then attaches the iodine to the tyrosine amino acid found in thyroglobulin. T3 has three iodine ions\nattached, while T4 has four iodine ions attached. T3 and T4 are then released into the bloodstream, with T4 being released in\nmuch greater amounts than T3. As T3 is more active than T4 and is responsible for most of the effects of thyroid hormones,\ntissues of the body convert T4 to T3 by the removal of an iodine ion. Most of the released T3and T4becomes attached to transport\nproteins in the bloodstream and is unable to cross the plasma membrane of cells. These protein-bound molecules are only\nreleased when blood levels of the unattached hormone begin to decline. In this way, a week\u2019s worth of reserve hormone is\nmaintained in the blood. Increased T3and T4levels in the blood inhibit the release of TSH, which results in lower T3and T4\nrelease from the thyroid.\n1060\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe follicular cells of the thyroid require iodides (anions of iodine) in order to synthesize T3and T4. Iodides obtained from the\ndiet are actively transported into follicle cells resulting in a concentration that is approximately 30 times higher than in blood.\nThe typical diet in North America provides more iodine than required due to the addition of iodide to table salt. Inadequate\niodine intake, which occurs in many developing countries, results in an inability to synthesize T3and T4hormones. The thyroid\ngland enlarges in a condition called goiter, which is caused by overproduction of TSH without the formation of thyroid\nhormone. Thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid, and TSH stimulation results in higher levels of colloid\naccumulation in the thyroid. In the absence of iodine, this is not converted to thyroid hormone, and colloid begins to accumulate\nmore and more in the thyroid gland, leading to goiter.\nDisorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones. Hypothyroidism,\nunderproduction of the thyroid hormones, can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain, sensitivity to cold, and\nreduced mental activity, among other symptoms. In children, hypothyroidism can cause cretinism, which can lead to mental\nretardation and growth defects. Hyperthyroidism, the overproduction of thyroid hormones, can lead to an increased metabolic\nrate and its effects: weight loss, excess heat production, sweating, and an increased heart rate. Graves\u2019 disease is one example of\na hyperthyroid condition.\nHormonal Control of Blood Calcium Levels\nRegulation of blood calcium concentrations is important for generation of muscle contractions and nerve impulses, which are\nelectrically stimulated. If calcium levels get too high, membrane permeability to sodium decreases and membranes become less\nresponsive. If calcium levels get too low, membrane permeability to sodium increases and convulsions or muscle spasms can\nresult.\nBlood calcium levels are regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is produced by the parathyroid glands, as illustrated in\nFigure 37.12. PTH is released in response to low blood Ca2+ levels. PTH increases Ca2+levels by targeting the skeleton, the\nkidneys, and the intestine. In the skeleton, PTH stimulates osteoclasts, which causes bone to be reabsorbed, releasing Ca2+from\nbone into the blood. PTH also inhibits osteoblasts, reducing Ca2+deposition in bone. In the intestines, PTH increases dietary\nCa2+ absorption, and in the kidneys, PTH stimulates reabsorption of the CA2+. While PTH acts directly on the kidneys to\nincrease Ca2+ reabsorption, its effects on the intestine are indirect. PTH triggers the formation of calcitriol, an active form of\nvitamin D, which acts on the intestines to increase absorption of dietary calcium. PTH release is inhibited by rising blood\ncalcium levels.\n37.3 \u2022 Regulation of Body Processes\n1061\nFigure 37.12 Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is released in response to low blood calcium levels. It increases blood calcium levels by targeting\nthe skeleton, the kidneys, and the intestine. (credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nHyperparathyroidism results from an overproduction of parathyroid hormone. This results in excessive calcium being removed\nfrom bones and introduced into blood circulation, producing structural weakness of the bones, which can lead to deformation\nand fractures, plus nervous system impairment due to high blood calcium levels. Hypoparathyroidism, the underproduction of\nPTH, results in extremely low levels of blood calcium, which causes impaired muscle function and may result in tetany (severe\nsustained muscle contraction).\nThe hormone calcitonin, which is produced by the parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid, has the opposite effect on blood\ncalcium levels as does PTH. Calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts, stimulating osteoblasts, and\nstimulating calcium excretion by the kidneys. This results in calcium being added to the bones to promote structural integrity.\nCalcitonin is most important in children (when it stimulates bone growth), during pregnancy (when it reduces maternal bone\nloss), and during prolonged starvation (because it reduces bone mass loss). In healthy nonpregnant, unstarved adults, the role of\ncalcitonin is unclear.\nHormonal Regulation of Growth\nHormonal regulation is required for the growth and replication of most cells in the body. Growth hormone (GH), produced by\nthe anterior portion of the pituitary gland, accelerates the rate of protein synthesis, particularly in skeletal muscle and bones.\nGrowth hormone has direct and indirect mechanisms of action. The first direct action of GH is stimulation of triglyceride\nbreakdown (lipolysis) and release into the blood by adipocytes. This results in a switch by most tissues from utilizing glucose as\nan energy source to utilizing fatty acids. This process is called a glucose-sparing effect. In another direct mechanism, GH\nstimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver; the glycogen is then released into the blood as glucose. Blood glucose levels increase\nas most tissues are utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose for their energy needs. The GH mediated increase in blood glucose\nlevels is called a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose levels seen in diabetes mellitus.\nThe indirect mechanism of GH action is mediated by insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) or somatomedins, which are a family of\ngrowth-promoting proteins produced by the liver, which stimulates tissue growth. IGFs stimulate the uptake of amino acids\n1062\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nfrom the blood, allowing the formation of new proteins, particularly in skeletal muscle cells, cartilage cells, and other target\ncells, as shown in Figure 37.13. This is especially important after a meal, when glucose and amino acid concentration levels are\nhigh in the blood. GH levels are regulated by two hormones produced by the hypothalamus. GH release is stimulated by growth\nhormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and is inhibited by growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH), also called\nsomatostatin.\nFigure 37.13 Growth hormone directly accelerates the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and bones. Insulin-like growth factor 1\n(IGF-1) is activated by growth hormone and also allows formation of new proteins in muscle cells and bone. (credit: modification of work by\nMikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nA balanced production of growth hormone is critical for proper development. Underproduction of GH in adults does not appear\nto cause any abnormalities, but in children it can result in pituitary dwarfism, in which growth is reduced. Pituitary dwarfism is\ncharacterized by symmetric body formation. In some cases, individuals are under 30 inches in height. Oversecretion of growth\nhormone can lead to gigantism in children, causing excessive growth. In some documented cases, individuals can reach heights\nof over eight feet. In adults, excessive GH can lead to acromegaly, a condition in which there is enlargement of bones in the face,\nhands, and feet that are still capable of growth.\n37.3 \u2022 Regulation of Body Processes\n1063\nHormonal Regulation of Stress\nWhen a threat or danger is perceived, the body responds by releasing hormones that will ready it for the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d\nresponse. The effects of this response are familiar to anyone who has been in a stressful situation: increased heart rate, dry\nmouth, and hair standing up.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nFight-or-Flight Response\nInteractions of the endocrine hormones have evolved to ensure the body\u2019s internal environment remains stable. Stressors are\nstimuli that disrupt homeostasis. The sympathetic division of the vertebrate autonomic nervous system has evolved the fight-\nor-flight response to counter stress-induced disruptions of homeostasis. In the initial alarm phase, the sympathetic nervous\nsystem stimulates an increase in energy levels through increased blood glucose levels. This prepares the body for physical\nactivity that may be required to respond to stress: to either fight for survival or to flee from danger.\nHowever, some stresses, such as illness or injury, can last for a long time. Glycogen reserves, which provide energy in the short-\nterm response to stress, are exhausted after several hours and cannot meet long-term energy needs. If glycogen reserves were\nthe only energy source available, neural functioning could not be maintained once the reserves became depleted due to the\nnervous system\u2019s high requirement for glucose. In this situation, the body has evolved a response to counter long-term stress\nthrough the actions of the glucocorticoids, which ensure that long-term energy requirements can be met. The glucocorticoids\nmobilize lipid and protein reserves, stimulate gluconeogenesis, conserve glucose for use by neural tissue, and stimulate the\nconservation of salts and water. The mechanisms to maintain homeostasis that are described here are those observed in the\nhuman body. However, the fight-or-flight response exists in some form in all vertebrates.\nThe sympathetic nervous system regulates the stress response via the hypothalamus. Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus\nto signal the adrenal medulla (which mediates short-term stress responses) via nerve impulses, and the adrenal cortex, which\nmediates long-term stress responses, via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is produced by the\nanterior pituitary.\nShort-term Stress Response\nWhen presented with a stressful situation, the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of\nenergy. The hormones epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) are released\nby the adrenal medulla. How do these hormones provide a burst of energy? Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase blood\nglucose levels by stimulating the liver and skeletal muscles to break down glycogen and by stimulating glucose release by liver\ncells. Additionally, these hormones increase oxygen availability to cells by increasing the heart rate and dilating the bronchioles.\nThe hormones also prioritize body function by increasing blood supply to essential organs such as the heart, brain, and skeletal\nmuscles, while restricting blood flow to organs not in immediate need, such as the skin, digestive system, and kidneys.\nEpinephrine and norepinephrine are collectively called catecholamines.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this Discovery Channel animation (http://openstax.org/l/adrenaline) describing the flight-or-flight response.\nLong-term Stress Response\nLong-term stress response differs from short-term stress response. The body cannot sustain the bursts of energy mediated by\nepinephrine and norepinephrine for long times. Instead, other hormones come into play. In a long-term stress response, the\nhypothalamus triggers the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland. The adrenal cortex is stimulated by ACTH to\nrelease steroid hormones called corticosteroids. Corticosteroids turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of target\ncells. They change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism. There are two main corticosteroids:\nglucocorticoids such as cortisol, and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. These hormones target the breakdown of fat into\nfatty acids in the adipose tissue. The fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues to use for ATP production.\nThe glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis. Glucocorticoids also have anti-\ninflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system. For example, cortisone is used as an anti-inflammatory\nmedication; however, it cannot be used long term as it increases susceptibility to disease due to its immune-suppressing effects.\n1064\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nMineralocorticoids function to regulate ion and water balance of the body. The hormone aldosterone stimulates the\nreabsorption of water and sodium ions in the kidney, which results in increased blood pressure and volume.\nHypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as Cushing\u2019s disease, characterized by a shifting of fat storage\nareas of the body. This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck, and excessive glucose in the blood.\nHyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause Addison\u2019s disease, which may result in bronzing of the skin, hypoglycemia, and\nlow electrolyte levels in the blood.\n37.4 Regulation of Hormone Production\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how hormone production is regulated\n\u2022\nDiscuss the different stimuli that control hormone levels in the body\nHormone production and release are primarily controlled by negative feedback. In negative feedback systems, a stimulus elicits\nthe release of a substance; once the substance reaches a certain level, it sends a signal that stops further release of the substance.\nIn this way, the concentration of hormones in blood is maintained within a narrow range. For example, the anterior pituitary\nsignals the thyroid to release thyroid hormones. Increasing levels of these hormones in the blood then give feedback to the\nhypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit further signaling to the thyroid gland, as illustrated in Figure 37.14. There are\nthree mechanisms by which endocrine glands are stimulated to synthesize and release hormones: humoral stimuli, hormonal\nstimuli, and neural stimuli.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 37.14 The anterior pituitary stimulates the thyroid gland to release thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Increasing levels of these hormones\nin the blood results in feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit further signaling to the thyroid gland. (credit:\nmodification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nHyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is overactive. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid\ngland is underactive. Which of the conditions are the following two patients most likely to have?\nPatient A has symptoms including weight gain, cold sensitivity, low heart rate, and fatigue.\n37.4 \u2022 Regulation of Hormone Production\n1065\nPatient B has symptoms including weight loss, profuse sweating, increased heart rate, and difficulty sleeping.\nHumoral Stimuli\nThe term \u201chumoral\u201d is derived from the term \u201chumor,\u201d which refers to bodily fluids such as blood. A humoral stimulus refers to\nthe control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the ion concentration in the blood.\nFor example, a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release of insulin. Insulin causes blood glucose levels to drop,\nwhich signals the pancreas to stop producing insulin in a negative feedback loop.\nHormonal Stimuli\nHormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone. A number of endocrine glands release\nhormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands. For example, the hypothalamus produces\nhormones that stimulate the anterior portion of the pituitary gland. The anterior pituitary in turn releases hormones that\nregulate hormone production by other endocrine glands. The anterior pituitary releases the thyroid-stimulating hormone,\nwhich then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce the hormones T3 and T4. As blood concentrations of T3 and T4 rise, they\ninhibit both the pituitary and the hypothalamus in a negative feedback loop.\nNeural Stimuli\nIn some cases, the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones, which is referred to as neural\nstimuli. Recall that in a short-term stress response, the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are important for providing\nthe bursts of energy required for the body to respond. Here, neuronal signaling from the sympathetic nervous system directly\nstimulates the adrenal medulla to release the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine in response to stress.\n37.5 Endocrine Glands\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the role of different glands in the endocrine system\n\u2022\nExplain how the different glands work together to maintain homeostasis\nBoth the endocrine and nervous systems use chemical signals to communicate and regulate the body's physiology. The\nendocrine system releases hormones that act on target cells to regulate development, growth, energy metabolism,\nreproduction, and many behaviors. The nervous system releases neurotransmitters or neurohormones that regulate neurons,\nmuscle cells, and endocrine cells. Because the neurons can regulate the release of hormones, the nervous and endocrine systems\nwork in a coordinated manner to regulate the body's physiology.\nHypothalamic-Pituitary Axis\nThe hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems. The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ\nlocated in the diencephalon of the brain. It receives input from the body and other brain areas and initiates endocrine responses\nto environmental changes. The hypothalamus acts as an endocrine organ, synthesizing hormones and transporting them along\naxons to the posterior pituitary gland. It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the\nanterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via\nneuronal control.\nThe pituitary gland, sometimes called the hypophysis or \u201cmaster gland\u201d is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica, a\ngroove of the sphenoid bone of the skull, illustrated in Figure 37.15. It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the\npituitary stalk (or infundibulum). The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release-inhibiting\nhormones produced by the hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release\nhormones produced by the hypothalamus. The pituitary has two distinct regions\u2014the anterior pituitary and the posterior\npituitary\u2014which between them secrete nine different peptide or protein hormones. The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland\ncontains axons of the hypothalamic neurons.\n1066\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 37.15 The pituitary gland is located at (a) the base of the brain and (b) connected to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk. (credit\na: modification of work by NCI; credit b: modification of work by Gray\u2019s Anatomy)\nAnterior Pituitary\nThe anterior pituitary gland, or adenohypophysis, is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus,\ndown along the infundibulum, and to the anterior pituitary. This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system\nthat carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the\ncirculatory system. A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another; therefore, the hypophyseal portal\nsystem allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the\ncirculatory system.\nThe anterior pituitary produces seven hormones: growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),\nmelanin-stimulating hormone (MSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and\nluteinizing hormone (LH). Anterior pituitary hormones are sometimes referred to as tropic hormones, because they control the\nfunctioning of other organs. While these hormones are produced by the anterior pituitary, their production is controlled by\nregulatory hormones produced by the hypothalamus. These regulatory hormones can be releasing hormones or inhibiting\nhormones, causing more or less of the anterior pituitary hormones to be secreted. These travel from the hypothalamus through\nthe hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary where they exert their effect. Negative feedback then regulates how\nmuch of these regulatory hormones are released and how much anterior pituitary hormone is secreted.\nPosterior Pituitary\nThe posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary. It is a part of the brain, extending down\nfrom the hypothalamus, and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells, which support axons that extend from the\nhypothalamus to the posterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary and the infundibulum together are referred to as the\nneurohypophysis.\nThe hormones antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, and oxytocin are produced by neurons in the\nhypothalamus and transported within these axons along the infundibulum to the posterior pituitary. They are released into the\ncirculatory system via neural signaling from the hypothalamus. These hormones are considered to be posterior pituitary\nhormones, even though they are produced by the hypothalamus, because that is where they are released into the circulatory\nsystem. The posterior pituitary itself does not produce hormones, but instead stores hormones produced by the hypothalamus\nand releases them into the bloodstream.\nThyroid Gland\nThe thyroid gland is located in the neck, just below the larynx and in front of the trachea, as shown in Figure 37.16. It is a\nbutterfly-shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus. It has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular\nsystem. When the thyroid swells due to dysfunction, it can be felt under the skin of the neck.\n37.5 \u2022 Endocrine Glands\n1067\nFigure 37.16 This illustration shows the location of the thyroid gland.\nThe thyroid gland is made up of many spherical thyroid follicles, which are lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium. These\nfollicles contain a viscous fluid, called colloid, which stores the glycoprotein thyroglobulin, the precursor to the thyroid\nhormones. The follicles produce hormones that can be stored in the colloid or released into the surrounding capillary network\nfor transport to the rest of the body via the circulatory system.\nThyroid follicle cells synthesize the hormone thyroxine, which is also known as T4 because it contains four atoms of iodine, and\ntriiodothyronine, also known as T3 because it contains three atoms of iodine. Follicle cells are stimulated to release stored T3and\nT4by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the anterior pituitary. These thyroid hormones increase the\nrates of mitochondrial ATP production.\nA third hormone, calcitonin, is produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid either releasing hormones or inhibiting\nhormones. Calcitonin release is not controlled by TSH, but instead is released when calcium ion concentrations in the blood\nrise. Calcitonin functions to help regulate calcium concentrations in body fluids. It acts in the bones to inhibit osteoclast activity\nand in the kidneys to stimulate excretion of calcium. The combination of these two events lowers body fluid levels of calcium.\nParathyroid Glands\nMost people have four parathyroid glands; however, the number can vary from two to six. These glands are located on the\nposterior surface of the thyroid gland, as shown in Figure 37.17. Normally, there is a superior gland and an inferior gland\nassociated with each of the thyroid\u2019s two lobes. Each parathyroid gland is covered by connective tissue and contains many\nsecretory cells that are associated with a capillary network.\n1068\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 37.17 The parathyroid glands are located on the posterior of the thyroid gland. (credit: modification of work by NCI)\nThe parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH increases blood calcium concentrations when calcium ion\nlevels fall below normal. PTH (1) enhances reabsorption of Ca2+ by the kidneys, (2) stimulates osteoclast activity and inhibits\nosteoblast activity, and (3) it stimulates synthesis and secretion of calcitriol by the kidneys, which enhances Ca2+ absorption by\nthe digestive system. PTH is produced by chief cells of the parathyroid. PTH and calcitonin work in opposition to one another to\nmaintain homeostatic Ca2+ levels in body fluids. Another type of cells, oxyphil cells, exist in the parathyroid but their function is\nnot known. These hormones encourage bone growth, muscle mass, and blood cell formation in children and women.\nAdrenal Glands\nThe adrenal glands are associated with the kidneys; one gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated in Figure 37.18. The\nadrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla. These regions secrete different hormones.\nFigure 37.18 The location of the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys is shown. (credit: modification of work by NCI)\nAdrenal Cortex\nThe adrenal cortex is made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks. These layers form three distinct\nregions: an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids, a middle zona fasciculata that produces glucocorticoids,\nand an inner zona reticularis that produces androgens.\nThe main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone, which regulates the concentration of Na+ ions in urine, sweat, pancreas, and saliva.\nAldosterone release from the adrenal cortex is stimulated by a decrease in blood concentrations of sodium ions, blood volume,\nor blood pressure, or by an increase in blood potassium levels.\n37.5 \u2022 Endocrine Glands\n1069\nThe three main glucocorticoids are cortisol, corticosterone, and cortisone. The glucocorticoids stimulate the synthesis of glucose\nand gluconeogenesis (converting a non-carbohydrate to glucose) by liver cells and they promote the release of fatty acids from\nadipose tissue. These hormones increase blood glucose levels to maintain levels within a normal range between meals. These\nhormones are secreted in response to ACTH and levels are regulated by negative feedback.\nAndrogens are sex hormones that promote masculinity. They are produced in small amounts by the adrenal cortex in both males\nand females. They do not affect sexual characteristics and may supplement sex hormones released from the gonads.\nAdrenal Medulla\nThe adrenal medulla contains large, irregularly shaped cells that are closely associated with blood vessels. These cells are\ninnervated by preganglionic autonomic nerve fibers from the central nervous system.\nThe adrenal medulla contains two types of secretory cells: one that produces epinephrine (adrenaline) and another that produces\nnorepinephrine (noradrenaline). Epinephrine is the primary adrenal medulla hormone accounting for 75 to 80 percent of its\nsecretions. Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase heart rate, breathing rate, cardiac muscle contractions, blood pressure,\nand blood glucose levels. They also accelerate the breakdown of glucose in skeletal muscles and stored fats in adipose tissue.\nThe release of epinephrine and norepinephrine is stimulated by neural impulses from the sympathetic nervous system.\nSecretion of these hormones is stimulated by acetylcholine release from preganglionic sympathetic fibers innervating the\nadrenal medulla. These neural impulses originate from the hypothalamus in response to stress to prepare the body for the fight-\nor-flight response.\nPancreas\nThe pancreas, illustrated in Figure 37.19, is an elongated organ that is located between the stomach and the proximal portion of\nthe small intestine. It contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release hormones. It is\nsometimes referred to as a heterocrine gland because it has both endocrine and exocrine functions.\nFigure 37.19 The pancreas is found underneath the stomach and points toward the spleen. (credit: modification of work by NCI)\nThe endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans, as visible in the micrograph\nshown in Figure 37.20. The pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types: alpha cells, which produce the hormone glucagon,\nand beta cells, which produce the hormone insulin. These hormones regulate blood glucose levels. As blood glucose levels\ndecline, alpha cells release glucagon to raise the blood glucose levels by increasing rates of glycogen breakdown and glucose\nrelease by the liver. When blood glucose levels rise, such as after a meal, beta cells release insulin to lower blood glucose levels by\nincreasing the rate of glucose uptake in most body cells, and by increasing glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscles and the liver.\nTogether, glucagon and insulin regulate blood glucose levels.\n1070\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 37.20 The islets of Langerhans are clusters of endocrine cells found in the pancreas; they stain lighter than surrounding cells.\n(credit: modification of work by Muhammad T. Tabiin, Christopher P. White, Grant Morahan, and Bernard E. Tuch; scale-bar data from Matt\nRussell)\nPineal Gland\nThe pineal gland produces melatonin. The rate of melatonin production is affected by the photoperiod. Collaterals from the\nvisual pathways innervate the pineal gland. During the day photoperiod, little melatonin is produced; however, melatonin\nproduction increases during the dark photoperiod (night). In some mammals, melatonin has an inhibitory affect on\nreproductive functions by decreasing production and maturation of sperm, oocytes, and reproductive organs. Melatonin is an\neffective antioxidant, protecting the CNS from free radicals such as nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide. Lastly, melatonin is\ninvolved in biological rhythms, particularly circadian rhythms such as the sleep-wake cycle and eating habits.\nGonads\nThe gonads\u2014the male testes and female ovaries\u2014produce steroid hormones. The testes produce androgens, testosterone being\nthe most prominent, which allow for the development of secondary sex characteristics and the production of sperm cells. The\novaries produce estradiol and progesterone, which cause secondary sex characteristics and prepare the body for childbirth.\nEndocrine Glands and their Associated Hormones\nEndocrine\nGland\nAssociated\nHormones\nEffect\nHypothalamus\nreleasing and\ninhibiting hormones\nregulate hormone release from pituitary gland; produce oxytocin; produce\nuterine contractions and milk secretion in females\nantidiuretic hormone\n(ADH)\nwater reabsorption from kidneys; vasoconstriction to increase blood pressure\nPituitary\n(Anterior)\ngrowth hormone (GH)\npromotes growth of body tissues, protein synthesis; metabolic functions\nprolactin (PRL)\npromotes milk production\nthyroid stimulating\nhormone (TSH)\nstimulates thyroid hormone release\nadrenocorticotropic\nhormone (ACTH)\nstimulates hormone release by adrenal cortex, glucocorticoids\nTable 37.1\n37.5 \u2022 Endocrine Glands\n1071\nEndocrine\nGland\nAssociated\nHormones\nEffect\nfollicle-stimulating\nhormone (FSH)\nstimulates gamete production (both ova and sperm); secretion of estradiol\nluteinizing hormone\n(LH)\nstimulates androgen production by gonads; ovulation, secretion of progesterone\nmelanocyte-\nstimulating hormone\n(MSH)\nstimulates melanocytes of the skin increasing melanin pigment production.\nPituitary\n(Posterior)\nantidiuretic hormone\n(ADH)\nstimulates water reabsorption by kidneys\noxytocin\nstimulates uterine contractions during childbirth; milk ejection; stimulates\nductus deferens and prostate gland contraction during emission\nThyroid\nthyroxine,\ntriiodothyronine\nstimulate and maintain metabolism; growth and development\ncalcitonin\nreduces blood Ca2+ levels\nParathyroid\nparathyroid hormone\n(PTH)\nincreases blood Ca2+levels\nAdrenal\n(Cortex)\naldosterone\nincreases blood Na+ levels; increases K+ secretion\ncortisol,\ncorticosterone,\ncortisone\nincrease blood glucose levels; anti-inflammatory effects\nAdrenal\n(Medulla)\nepinephrine,\nnorepinephrine\nstimulate fight-or-flight response; increase blood gluclose levels; increase\nmetabolic activities\nPancreas\ninsulin\nreduces blood glucose levels\nglucagon\nincreases blood glucose levels\nPineal gland\nmelatonin\nregulates some biological rhythms and protects CNS from free radicals\nTestes\nandrogens\nregulate, promote, increase or maintain sperm production; male secondary\nsexual characteristics\nOvaries\nestrogen\npromotes uterine lining growth; female secondary sexual characteristics\nprogestins\npromote and maintain uterine lining growth\nTable 37.1\n1072\nChapter 37 \u2022 The Endocrine System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nOrgans with Secondary Endocrine Functions\nThere are several organs whose primary functions are non-endocrine but that also possess endocrine functions. These include\nthe heart, kidneys, intestines, thymus, gonads, and adipose tissue.\nThe heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells. These cells release the\nhormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in response to increased blood volume. High blood volume causes the cells to be\nstretched, resulting in hormone release. ANP acts on the kidneys to reduce the reabsorption of Na+, causing Na+ and water to be\nexcreted in the urine. ANP also reduces the amounts of renin released by the kidneys and aldosterone released by the adrenal\ncortex, further preventing the retention of water. In this way, ANP causes a reduction in blood volume and blood pressure, and\nreduces the concentration of Na+ in the blood.\nThe gastrointestinal tract produces several hormones that aid in digestion. The endocrine cells are located in the mucosa of the\nGI tract throughout the stomach and small intestine. Some of the hormones produced include gastrin, secretin, and\ncholecystokinin, which are secreted in the presence of food, and some of which act on other organs such as the pancreas,\ngallbladder, and liver. They trigger the release of gastric juices, which help to break down and digest food in the GI tract.\nWhile the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are major endocrine glands, the kidneys themselves also possess\nendocrine function. Renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone then causes the retention of Na+ and water, raising\nblood volume. The kidneys also release calcitriol, which aids in the absorption of Ca2+ and phosphate ions. Erythropoietin (EPO)\nis a protein hormone that triggers the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. EPO is released in response to low\noxygen levels. Because red blood cells are oxygen carriers, increased production results in greater oxygen delivery throughout\nthe body. EPO has been used by athletes to improve performance, as greater oxygen delivery to muscle cells allows for greater\nendurance. Because red blood cells increase the viscosity of blood, artificially high levels of EPO can cause severe health risks.\nThe thymus is found behind the sternum; it is most prominent in infants, becoming smaller in size through adulthood. The\nthymus produces hormones referred to as thymosins, which contribute to the development of the immune response.\nAdipose tissue is a connective tissue found throughout the body. It produces the hormone leptin in response to food intake.\nLeptin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons and decreases that of orexigenic neurons, producing a feeling of satiety\nafter eating, thus affecting appetite and reducing the urge for further eating. Leptin is also associated with reproduction. It\nmust be present for GnRH and gonadotropin synthesis to occur. Extremely thin females may enter puberty late; however, if\nadipose levels increase, more leptin will be produced, improving fertility.\n37.5 \u2022 Endocrine Glands\n1073\n", "key_terms": "\nacromegaly\ncondition caused by overproduction of GH in\nadults\nAddison\u2019s disease\ndisorder caused by the hyposecretion of\ncorticosteroids\nadenylate cyclase\nan enzyme that catalyzes the conversion\nof ATP to cyclic AMP\nadrenal cortex\nouter portion of adrenal glands that\nproduces corticosteroids\nadrenal gland\nendocrine glands associated with the\nkidneys\nadrenal medulla\ninner portion of adrenal glands that\nproduces epinephrine and norepinephrine\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)\nhormone released\nby the anterior pituitary, which stimulates the adrenal\ncortex to release corticosteroids during the long-term\nstress response\naldosterone\nsteroid hormone produced by the adrenal\ncortex that stimulates the reabsorption of Na+ from\nextracellular fluids and secretion of K+\nalpha cell\nendocrine cell of the pancreatic islets that\nproduces the hormone glucagon\namino acid-derived hormone\nhormone derived from\namino acids\nandrogen\nmale sex hormone such as testosterone\nanterior pituitary\nportion of the pituitary gland that\nproduces six hormones;

Lipid-derived hormones\nare structurally similar to cholesterol and include steroid\nhormones such as estradiol and testosterone. Amino acid-\nderived hormones are relatively small molecules and include\nthe adrenal hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine.\nPeptide hormones are polypeptide chains or proteins and\ninclude the pituitary hormones, antidiuretic hormone\n(vasopressin), and oxytocin.\n37.2 How Hormones Work\nHormones cause cellular changes by binding to receptors on\ntarget cells. The number of receptors on a target cell can\nincrease or decrease in response to hormone activity.\nHormones can affect cells directly through intracellular\nhormone receptors or indirectly through plasma membrane\nChapter 37 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n1075\nhormone receptors.\nLipid-derived (soluble) hormones can enter the cell by\ndiffusing across the plasma membrane and binding to DNA\nto regulate gene transcription and to change the cell\u2019s\nactivities by inducing production of proteins that affect, in\ngeneral, the long-term structure and function of the cell.\nLipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the plasma\nmembrane surface and trigger a signaling pathway to change\nthe cell\u2019s activities by inducing production of various cell\nproducts that affect the cell in the short-term. The hormone\nis called a first messenger and the cellular component is\ncalled a second messenger. G-proteins activate the second\nmessenger (cyclic AMP), triggering the cellular response.\nResponse to hormone binding is amplified as the signaling\npathway progresses. Cellular responses to hormones include\nthe production of proteins and enzymes and altered\nmembrane permeability.\n37.3 Regulation of Body Processes\nWater levels in the body are controlled by antidiuretic\nhormone (ADH), which is produced in the hypothalamus and\ntriggers the reabsorption of water by the kidneys.\nUnderproduction of ADH can cause diabetes insipidus.\nAldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal cortex of\nthe kidneys, enhances Na+ reabsorption from the\nextracellular fluids and subsequent water reabsorption by\ndiffusion. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is one\nway that aldosterone release is controlled.\nThe reproductive system is controlled by the gonadotropins\nfollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone\n(LH), which are produced by the pituitary gland.\nGonadotropin release is controlled by the hypothalamic\nhormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). FSH\nstimulates the maturation of sperm cells in males and is\ninhibited by the hormone inhibin, while LH stimulates the\nproduction of the androgen testosterone. FSH stimulates\negg maturation in females, while LH stimulates the\nproduction of estrogens and progesterone. Estrogens are a\ngroup of steroid hormones produced by the ovaries that\ntrigger the development of secondary sex characteristics in\nfemales as well as control the maturation of the ova. In\nfemales, the pituitary also produces prolactin, which\nstimulates milk production after childbirth, and oxytocin,\nwhich stimulates uterine contraction during childbirth and\nmilk let-down during suckling.\nInsulin is produced by the pancreas in response to rising\nblood glucose levels and allows cells to utilize blood glucose\nand store excess glucose for later use. Diabetes mellitus is\ncaused by reduced insulin activity and causes high blood\nglucose levels, or hyperglycemia. Glucagon is released by the\npancreas in response to low blood glucose levels and\nstimulates the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which\ncan be used by the body. The body\u2019s basal metabolic rate is\ncontrolled by the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and\ntriiodothyronine (T3). The anterior pituitary produces thyroid\nstimulating hormone (TSH), which controls the release of T3\nand T4 from the thyroid gland. Iodine is necessary in the\nproduction of thyroid hormone, and the lack of iodine can\nlead to a condition called goiter.\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) is produced by the parathyroid\nglands in response to low blood Ca2+ levels. The parafollicular\ncells of the thyroid produce calcitonin, which reduces blood\nCa2+ levels. Growth hormone (GH) is produced by the\nanterior pituitary and controls the growth rate of muscle and\nbone. GH action is indirectly mediated by insulin-like\ngrowth factors (IGFs). Short-term stress causes the\nhypothalamus to trigger the adrenal medulla to release\nepinephrine and norepinephrine, which trigger the fight or\nflight response. Long-term stress causes the hypothalamus\nto trigger the anterior pituitary to release\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which causes the\nrelease of corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, and\nmineralocorticoids, from the adrenal cortex.\n37.4 Regulation of Hormone\nProduction\nHormone levels are primarily controlled through negative\nfeedback, in which rising levels of a hormone inhibit its\nfurther release. The three mechanisms of hormonal release\nare humoral stimuli, hormonal stimuli, and neural stimuli.\nHumoral stimuli refers to the control of hormonal release in\nresponse to changes in extracellular fluid levels or ion levels.\nHormonal stimuli refers to the release of hormones in\nresponse to hormones released by other endocrine glands.\nNeural stimuli refers to the release of hormones in response\nto neural stimulation.\n37.5 Endocrine Glands\nThe pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain and is\nattached to the hypothalamus by the infundibulum. The\nanterior pituitary receives products from the hypothalamus\nby the hypophyseal portal system and produces six\nhormones. The posterior pituitary is an extension of the\nbrain and releases hormones (antidiuretic hormone and\noxytocin) produced by the hypothalamus.\nThe thyroid gland is located in the neck and is composed of\ntwo lobes connected by the isthmus. The thyroid is made up\nof follicle cells that produce the hormones thyroxine and\ntriiodothyronine. Parafollicular cells of the thyroid produce\ncalcitonin. The parathyroid glands lie on the posterior\nsurface of the thyroid gland and produce parathyroid\nhormone.\nThe adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and\nconsist of the renal cortex and renal medulla. The adrenal\n1076\nChapter 37 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncortex is the outer part of the adrenal gland and produces the\ncorticosteroids, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids. The\nadrenal medulla is the inner part of the adrenal gland and\nproduces the catecholamines epinephrine and\nnorepinephrine.\nThe pancreas lies in the abdomen between the stomach and\nthe small intestine. Clusters of endocrine cells in the\npancreas form the islets of Langerhans, which are composed\nof alpha cells that release glucagon and beta cells that release\ninsulin.\nSome organs possess endocrine activity as a secondary\nfunction but have another primary function. The heart\nproduces the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide, which\nfunctions to reduce blood volume, pressure, and Na+\nconcentration. The gastrointestinal tract produces various\nhormones that aid in digestion. The kidneys produce renin,\ncalcitriol, and erythropoietin. Adipose tissue produces\nleptin, which promotes satiety signals in the brain.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

(credit: modification of work by Stuart Grout)\nINTRODUCTION The muscular and skeletal systems provide support to the body and allow for a wide\nrange of movement. The bones of the skeletal system protect the body\u2019s internal organs and support the\nweight of the body. The muscles of the muscular system contract and pull on the bones, allowing for\nmovements as diverse as standing, walking, running, and grasping items.\nInjury or disease affecting the musculoskeletal system can be very debilitating. In humans, the most\ncommon musculoskeletal diseases worldwide are caused by malnutrition. Ailments that affect the joints\nare also widespread, such as arthritis, which can make movement difficult and\u2014in advanced\ncases\u2014completely impair mobility. In severe cases in which the joint has suffered extensive damage,\njoint replacement surgery may be needed.\nProgress in the science of prosthesis design has resulted in the development of artificial joints, with joint\nreplacement surgery in the hips and knees being the most common. Replacement joints for shoulders,\nelbows, and fingers are also available. Even with this progress, there is still room for improvement in the\ndesign of prostheses. The state-of-the-art prostheses have limited durability and therefore wear out\nquickly, particularly in young or active individuals. Current research is focused on the use of new\nmaterials, such as carbon fiber, that may make prostheses more durable.\nChapter Outline\n38.1 Types of Skeletal\nSystems\n38.2 Bone\n38.3 Joints and Skeletal\nMovement\n38.4 Muscle Contraction\nand Locomotion\nA skeletal system is necessary to support the body, protect internal organs, and allow for the movement of an\norganism. There are three different skeleton designs that fulfill these functions: hydrostatic skeleton,\nexoskeleton, and endoskeleton.\nHydrostatic Skeleton\nA hydrostatic skeleton is a skeleton formed by a fluid-filled compartment within the body, called the coelom.\nThe organs of the coelom are supported by the aqueous fluid, which also resists external compression. This\ncompartment is under hydrostatic pressure because of the fluid and supports the other organs of the\norganism. This type of skeletal system is found in soft-bodied animals such as sea anemones, earthworms,\nCnidaria, and other invertebrates (Figure 38.2).\nFigure 38.2 The skeleton of the red-knobbed sea star (Protoreaster linckii) is an example of a hydrostatic skeleton.\n(credit: \u201cAmada44\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nMovement in a hydrostatic skeleton is provided by muscles that surround the coelom. The muscles in a\nhydrostatic skeleton contract to change the shape of the coelom; the pressure of the fluid in the coelom\nproduces movement. For example, earthworms move by waves of muscular contractions of the skeletal\nmuscle of the body wall hydrostatic skeleton, called peristalsis, which alternately shorten and lengthen the\nbody. Lengthening the body extends the anterior end of the organism. Most organisms have a mechanism to\nfix themselves in the substrate. Shortening the muscles then draws the posterior portion of the body\nforward. Although a hydrostatic skeleton is well-suited to invertebrate organisms such as earthworms and\nsome aquatic organisms, it is not an efficient skeleton for terrestrial animals.\nExoskeleton\nAn exoskeleton is an external skeleton that consists of a hard encasement on the surface of an organism. For\nexample, the shells of crabs and insects are exoskeletons (Figure 38.3). This skeleton type provides defence\nagainst predators, supports the body, and allows for movement through the contraction of attached\nmuscles. As with vertebrates, muscles must cross a joint inside the exoskeleton. Shortening of the muscle\nchanges the relationship of the two segments of the exoskeleton. Arthropods such as crabs and lobsters have\nexoskeletons that consist of 30\u201350 percent chitin, a polysaccharide derivative of glucose that is a strong but\nflexible material. Chitin is secreted by the epidermal cells. The exoskeleton is further strengthened by the\naddition of calcium carbonate in organisms such as the lobster. Because the exoskeleton is acellular,\narthropods must periodically shed their exoskeletons because the exoskeleton does not grow as the organism\ngrows.\n1082\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 38.3 Muscles attached to the exoskeleton of the Halloween crab (Gecarcinus quadratus) allow it to move.\nEndoskeleton\nAn endoskeleton is a skeleton that consists of hard, mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of organisms. An\nexample of a primitive endoskeletal structure is the spicules of sponges. The bones of vertebrates are composed of tissues,\nwhereas sponges have no true tissues (Figure 38.4). Endoskeletons provide support for the body, protect internal organs, and\nallow for movement through contraction of muscles attached to the skeleton.\nFigure 38.4 The skeletons of humans and horses are examples of endoskeletons. (credit: Ross Murphy)\nThe human skeleton is an endoskeleton that consists of 206 bones in the adult. It has five main functions: providing support to\nthe body, storing minerals and lipids, producing blood cells, protecting internal organs, and allowing for movement. The\nskeletal system in vertebrates is divided into the axial skeleton (which consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage), and\nthe appendicular skeleton (which consists of the shoulders, limb bones, the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle).\n38.1 \u2022 Types of Skeletal Systems\n1083\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit the interactive body (http://openstax.org/l/virt_skeleton) site to build a virtual skeleton: select \"skeleton\" and click through\nthe activity to place each bone.\nHuman Axial Skeleton\nThe axial skeleton forms the central axis of the body and includes the bones of the skull, ossicles of the middle ear, hyoid bone of\nthe throat, vertebral column, and the thoracic cage (ribcage) (Figure 38.5). The function of the axial skeleton is to provide\nsupport and protection for the brain, the spinal cord, and the organs in the ventral body cavity. It provides a surface for the\nattachment of muscles that move the head, neck, and trunk, performs respiratory movements, and stabilizes parts of the\nappendicular skeleton.\nFigure 38.5 The axial skeleton consists of the bones of the skull, ossicles of the middle ear, hyoid bone, vertebral column, and rib cage.\n(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe Skull\nThe bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain. The skull consists of 22 bones, which are divided\ninto two categories: cranial bones and facial bones. The cranial bones are eight bones that form the cranial cavity, which\nencloses the brain and serves as an attachment site for the muscles of the head and neck. The eight cranial bones are the frontal\nbone, two parietal bones, two temporal bones, occipital bone, sphenoid bone, and the ethmoid bone. Although the bones\ndeveloped separately in the embryo and fetus, in the adult, they are tightly fused with connective tissue and adjoining bones do\nnot move (Figure 38.6).\n1084\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 38.6 The bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz\nVillareal)\nThe auditory ossicles of the middle ear transmit sounds from the air as vibrations to the fluid-filled cochlea. The auditory\nossicles consist of three bones each: the malleus, incus, and stapes. These are the smallest bones in the body and are unique to\nmammals.\nFourteen facial bones form the face, provide cavities for the sense organs (eyes, mouth, and nose), protect the entrances to the\ndigestive and respiratory tracts, and serve as attachment points for facial muscles. The 14 facial bones are the nasal bones, the\nmaxillary bones, zygomatic bones, palatine, vomer, lacrimal bones, the inferior nasal conchae, and the mandible. All of these\nbones occur in pairs except for the mandible and the vomer (Figure 38.7).\n38.1 \u2022 Types of Skeletal Systems\n1085\nFigure 38.7 The cranial bones, including the frontal, parietal, and sphenoid bones, cover the top of the head. The facial bones of the skull\nform the face and provide cavities for the eyes, nose, and mouth.\nAlthough it is not found in the skull, the hyoid bone is considered a component of the axial skeleton. The hyoid bone lies below\nthe mandible in the front of the neck. It acts as a movable base for the tongue and is connected to muscles of the jaw, larynx, and\ntongue. The mandible articulates with the base of the skull. The mandible controls the opening to the airway and gut. In animals\nwith teeth, the mandible brings the surfaces of the teeth in contact with the maxillary teeth.\nThe Vertebral Column\nThe vertebral column, or spinal column, surrounds and protects the spinal cord, supports the head, and acts as an attachment\npoint for the ribs and muscles of the back and neck. The adult vertebral column comprises 26 bones: the 24 vertebrae, the\nsacrum, and the coccyx bones. In the adult, the sacrum is typically composed of five vertebrae that fuse into one. The coccyx is\ntypically 3\u20134 vertebrae that fuse into one. Around the age of 70, the sacrum and the coccyx may fuse together. We begin life with\napproximately 33 vertebrae, but as we grow, several vertebrae fuse together. The adult vertebrae are further divided into the 7\ncervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, and 5 lumbar vertebrae (Figure 38.8).\n1086\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 38.8 (a) The vertebral column consists of seven cervical vertebrae (C1\u20137) twelve thoracic vertebrae (Th1\u201312), five lumbar vertebrae\n(L1\u20135), the os sacrum, and the coccyx. (b) Spinal curves increase the strength and flexibility of the spine. (credit a: modification of work by\nUwe Gille based on original work by Gray's Anatomy; credit b: modification of work by NCI, NIH)\nEach vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the nerves of the spinal cord pass. There is also a notch on each\nside through which the spinal nerves, which serve the body at that level, can exit from the spinal cord. The vertebral column is\napproximately 71 cm (28 inches) in adult male humans and is curved, which can be seen from a side view. The names of the\nspinal curves correspond to the region of the spine in which they occur. The thoracic and sacral curves are concave (curve\ninwards relative to the front of the body) and the cervical and lumbar curves are convex (curve outwards relative to the front of\nthe body). The arched curvature of the vertebral column increases its strength and flexibility, allowing it to absorb shocks like a\nspring (Figure 38.8).\nIntervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra to the\nsacrum. Each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from\nmovements such as walking and running. Intervertebral discs also act as ligaments to bind vertebrae together. The inner part of\ndiscs, the nucleus pulposus, hardens as people age and becomes less elastic. This loss of elasticity diminishes its ability to absorb\nshocks.\nThe Thoracic Cage\nThe thoracic cage, also known as the ribcage, is the skeleton of the chest, and consists of the ribs, sternum, thoracic vertebrae,\nand costal cartilages (Figure 38.9). The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity, including the heart\nand lungs. It also provides support for the shoulder girdles and upper limbs, and serves as the attachment point for the\ndiaphragm, muscles of the back, chest, neck, and shoulders. Changes in the volume of the thorax enable breathing.\nThe sternum, or breastbone, is a long, flat bone located at the anterior of the chest. It is formed from three bones that fuse in the\nadult. The ribs are 12 pairs of long, curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body,\nforming the ribcage. Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum, with the exception of rib pairs 11 and\n38.1 \u2022 Types of Skeletal Systems\n1087\n12, which are free-floating ribs.\nFigure 38.9 The thoracic cage, or rib cage, protects the heart and the lungs. (credit: modification of work by NCI, NIH)\nHuman Appendicular Skeleton\nThe appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the upper limbs (which function to grasp and manipulate objects) and\nthe lower limbs (which permit locomotion). It also includes the pectoral girdle, or shoulder girdle, that attaches the upper limbs\nto the body, and the pelvic girdle that attaches the lower limbs to the body (Figure 38.10).\n1088\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 38.10 The appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the pectoral limbs (arm, forearm, hand), the pelvic limbs (thigh, leg,\nfoot), the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe Pectoral Girdle\nThe pectoral girdle bones provide the points of attachment of the upper limbs to the axial skeleton. The human pectoral girdle\nconsists of the clavicle (or collarbone) in the anterior, and the scapula (or shoulder blades) in the posterior (Figure 38.11).\nFigure 38.11 (a) The pectoral girdle in primates consists of the clavicles and scapulae. (b) The posterior view reveals the spine of the\nscapula to which muscle attaches.\n38.1 \u2022 Types of Skeletal Systems\n1089\nThe clavicles are S-shaped bones that position the arms on the body. The clavicles lie horizontally across the front of the thorax\n(chest) just above the first rib. These bones are fairly fragile and are susceptible to fractures. For example, a fall with the arms\noutstretched causes the force to be transmitted to the clavicles, which can break if the force is excessive. The clavicle articulates\nwith the sternum and the scapula.\nThe scapulae are flat, triangular bones that are located at the back of the pectoral girdle. They support the muscles crossing the\nshoulder joint. A ridge, called the spine, runs across the back of the scapula and can easily be felt through the skin (Figure 38.11).\nThe spine of the scapula is a good example of a bony protrusion that facilitates a broad area of attachment for muscles to bone.\nThe Upper Limb\nThe upper limb contains 30 bones in three regions: the arm (shoulder to elbow), the forearm (ulna and radius), and the wrist and\nhand (Figure 38.12).\nFigure 38.12 The upper limb consists of the humerus of the upper arm, the radius and ulna of the forearm, eight bones of the carpus, five\nbones of the metacarpus, and 14 bones of the phalanges.\nAn articulation is any place at which two bones are joined. The humerus is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb and\nthe only bone of the arm. It articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow. The forearm extends\nfrom the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones: the ulna and the radius. The radius is located along the lateral (thumb)\nside of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow. The ulna is located on the medial aspect (pinky-finger side) of\nthe forearm. It is longer than the radius. The ulna articulates with the humerus at the elbow. The radius and ulna also articulate\nwith the carpal bones and with each other, which in vertebrates enables a variable degree of rotation of the carpus with respect\nto the long axis of the limb. The hand includes the eight bones of the carpus (wrist), the five bones of the metacarpus (palm), and\nthe 14 bones of the phalanges (digits). Each digit consists of three phalanges, except for the thumb, when present, which has\nonly two.\nThe Pelvic Girdle\nThe pelvic girdle attaches to the lower limbs of the axial skeleton. Because it is responsible for bearing the weight of the body\nand for locomotion, the pelvic girdle is securely attached to the axial skeleton by strong ligaments. It also has deep sockets with\nrobust ligaments to securely attach the femur to the body. The pelvic girdle is further strengthened by two large hip bones. In\nadults, the hip bones, or coxal bones, are formed by the fusion of three pairs of bones: the ilium, ischium, and pubis. The pelvis\njoins together in the anterior of the body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the sacrum at the posterior\nof the body.\nThe female pelvis is slightly different from the male pelvis. Over generations of evolution, females with a wider pubic angle and\nlarger diameter pelvic canal reproduced more successfully. Therefore, their offspring also had pelvic anatomy that enabled\n1090\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nsuccessful childbirth (Figure 38.13).\nFigure 38.13 To adapt to reproductive fitness, the (a) female pelvis is lighter, wider, shallower, and has a broader angle between the pubic\nbones than (b) the male pelvis.\nThe Lower Limb\nThe lower limb consists of the thigh, the leg, and the foot. The bones of the lower limb are the femur (thigh bone), patella\n(kneecap), tibia and fibula (bones of the leg), tarsals (bones of the ankle), and metatarsals and phalanges (bones of the foot)\n(Figure 38.14). The bones of the lower limbs are thicker and stronger than the bones of the upper limbs because of the need to\nsupport the entire weight of the body and the resulting forces from locomotion. In addition to evolutionary fitness, the bones of\nan individual will respond to forces exerted upon them.\nFigure 38.14 The lower limb consists of the thigh (femur), kneecap (patella), leg (tibia and fibula), ankle (tarsals), and foot (metatarsals and\nphalanges) bones.\nThe femur, or thighbone, is the longest, heaviest, and strongest bone in the body. The femur and pelvis form the hip joint at the\nproximal end. At the distal end, the femur, tibia, and patella form the knee joint. The patella, or kneecap, is a triangular bone\nthat lies anterior to the knee joint. The patella is embedded in the tendon of the femoral extensors (quadriceps). It improves\nknee extension by reducing friction. The tibia, or shinbone, is a large bone of the leg that is located directly below the knee. The\ntibia articulates with the femur at its proximal end, with the fibula and the tarsal bones at its distal end. It is the second largest\n38.1 \u2022 Types of Skeletal Systems\n1091\nbone in the human body and is responsible for transmitting the weight of the body from the femur to the foot. The fibula, or calf\nbone, parallels and articulates with the tibia. It does not articulate with the femur and does not bear weight. The fibula acts as a\nsite for muscle attachment and forms the lateral part of the ankle joint.\nThe tarsals are the seven bones of the ankle. The ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot.\nThe metatarsals are the five bones of the foot. The phalanges are the 14 bones of the toes. Each toe consists of three phalanges,\nexcept for the big toe that has only two (Figure 38.15). Variations exist in other species; for example, the horse\u2019s metacarpals and\nmetatarsals are oriented vertically and do not make contact with the substrate.\nFigure 38.15 This drawing shows the bones of the human foot and ankle, including the metatarsals and the phalanges.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nEvolution of Body Design for Locomotion on Land\nThe transition of vertebrates onto land required a number of changes in body design, as movement on land presents a number\nof challenges for animals that are adapted to movement in water. The buoyancy of water provides a certain amount of lift, and a\ncommon form of movement by fish is lateral undulations of the entire body. This back and forth movement pushes the body\nagainst the water, creating forward movement. In most fish, the muscles of paired fins attach to girdles within the body,\nallowing for some control of locomotion. As certain fish began moving onto land, they retained their lateral undulation form of\nlocomotion (anguilliform). However, instead of pushing against water, their fins or flippers became points of contact with the\nground, around which they rotated their bodies.\nThe effect of gravity and the lack of buoyancy on land meant that body weight was suspended on the limbs, leading to increased\nstrengthening and ossification of the limbs. The effect of gravity also required changes to the axial skeleton. Lateral undulations\nof land animal vertebral columns cause torsional strain. A firmer, more ossified vertebral column became common in terrestrial\ntetrapods because it reduces strain while providing the strength needed to support the body\u2019s weight. In later tetrapods, the\nvertebrae began allowing for vertical motion rather than lateral flexion. Another change in the axial skeleton was the loss of a\ndirect attachment between the pectoral girdle and the head. This reduced the jarring to the head caused by the impact of the\nlimbs on the ground. The vertebrae of the neck also evolved to allow movement of the head independently of the body.\nThe appendicular skeleton of land animals is also different from aquatic animals. The shoulders attach to the pectoral girdle\nthrough muscles and connective tissue, thus reducing the jarring of the skull. Because of a lateral undulating vertebral column,\nin early tetrapods, the limbs were splayed out to the side and movement occurred by performing \u201cpush-ups.\u201d The vertebrae of\nthese animals had to move side-to-side in a similar manner to fish and reptiles. This type of motion requires large muscles to\nmove the limbs toward the midline; it was almost like walking while doing push-ups, and it is not an efficient use of energy.\nLater tetrapods have their limbs placed under their bodies, so that each stride requires less force to move forward. This resulted\nin decreased adductor muscle size and an increased range of motion of the scapulae. This also restricts movement primarily to\none plane, creating forward motion rather than moving the limbs upward as well as forward. The femur and humerus were also\nrotated, so that the ends of the limbs and digits were pointed forward, in the direction of motion, rather than out to the side. By\nplacement underneath the body, limbs can swing forward like a pendulum to produce a stride that is more efficient for moving\nover land.\n1092\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n38.2 Bone\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nClassify the different types of bones in the skeleton\n\u2022\nExplain the role of the different cell types in bone\n\u2022\nExplain how bone forms during development\nBone, or osseous tissue, is a connective tissue that constitutes the endoskeleton. It contains specialized cells and a matrix of\nmineral salts and collagen fibers.\nThe mineral salts primarily include hydroxyapatite, a mineral formed from calcium phosphate. Calcification is the process of\ndeposition of mineral salts on the collagen fiber matrix that crystallizes and hardens the tissue. The process of calcification only\noccurs in the presence of collagen fibers.\nThe bones of the human skeleton are classified by their shape: long bones, short bones, flat bones, sutural bones, sesamoid\nbones, and irregular bones (Figure 38.16).\nFigure 38.16 Shown are different types of bones: flat, irregular, long, short, and sesamoid.\n38.2 \u2022 Bone\n1093\nLong bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends. The diaphysis, or central shaft, contains bone marrow\nin a marrow cavity. The rounded ends, the epiphyses, are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red bone marrow,\nwhich produces blood cells (Figure 38.17). Most of the limb bones are long bones\u2014for example, the femur, tibia, ulna, and\nradius. Exceptions to this include the patella and the bones of the wrist and ankle.\nFigure 38.17 The long bone is covered by articular cartilage at either end and contains bone marrow (shown in yellow in this illustration) in\nthe marrow cavity.\nShort bones, or cuboidal bones, are bones that are the same width and length, giving them a cube-like shape. For example, the\nbones of the wrist (carpals) and ankle (tarsals) are short bones (Figure 38.16).\nFlat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or where broad\nsurfaces of muscle attachment are required. Examples of flat bones are the sternum (breast bone), ribs, scapulae (shoulder\nblades), and the roof of the skull (Figure 38.16).\nIrregular bones are bones with complex shapes. These bones may have short, flat, notched, or ridged surfaces. Examples of\nirregular bones are the vertebrae, hip bones, and several skull bones.\nSesamoid bones are small, flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed. The patellae are sesamoid bones (Figure 38.18).\nSesamoid bones develop inside tendons and may be found near joints at the knees, hands, and feet.\n1094\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 38.18 The patella of the knee is an example of a sesamoid bone.\nSutural bones are small, flat, irregularly shaped bones. They may be found between the flat bones of the skull. They vary in\nnumber, shape, size, and position.\nBone Tissue\nBones are considered organs because they contain various types of tissue, such as blood, connective tissue, nerves, and bone\ntissue. Osteocytes, the living cells of bone tissue, form the mineral matrix of bones. There are two types of bone tissue: compact\nand spongy.\nCompact Bone Tissue\nCompact bone (or cortical bone) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone marrow.\nIt provides protection and strength to bones. Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems.\nOsteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi, which transport\nblood. They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each osteon consists of lamellae, which are layers of compact matrix\nthat surround a central canal called the Haversian canal. The Haversian canal (osteonic canal) contains the bone\u2019s blood vessels\nand nerve fibers (Figure 38.19). Osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along lines of stress and help\nthe bone resist bending or fracturing. Therefore, compact bone tissue is prominent in areas of bone at which stresses are applied\nin only a few directions.\n38.2 \u2022 Bone\n1095\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 38.19 Compact bone tissue consists of osteons that are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone, and the Haversian canal that\ncontains the bone\u2019s blood vessels and nerve fibers. The inner layer of bones consists of spongy bone tissue. The small dark ovals in the\nosteon represent the living osteocytes. (credit: modification of work by NCI, NIH)\nWhich of the following statements about bone tissue is false?\na.\nCompact bone tissue is made of cylindrical osteons that are aligned such that they travel the length of the bone.\nb.\nHaversian canals contain blood vessels only.\nc.\nHaversian canals contain blood vessels and nerve fibers.\nd.\nSpongy tissue is found on the interior of the bone, and compact bone tissue is found on the exterior.\nSpongy Bone Tissue\nWhereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones, spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all\nbones. Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue. Instead, it consists of trabeculae,\nwhich are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates. Red bone marrow is found between the trabuculae. Blood vessels within\nthis tissue deliver nutrients to osteocytes and remove waste. The red bone marrow of the femur and the interior of other large\nbones, such as the ilium, forms blood cells.\nSpongy bone reduces the density of bone and allows the ends of long bones to compress as the result of stresses applied to the\nbone. Spongy bone is prominent in areas of bones that are not heavily stressed or where stresses arrive from many directions.\nThe epiphyses of bones, such as the neck of the femur, are subject to stress from many directions. Imagine laying a heavy framed\npicture flat on the floor. You could hold up one side of the picture with a toothpick if the toothpick was perpendicular to the floor\nand the picture. Now drill a hole and stick the toothpick into the wall to hang up the picture. In this case, the function of the\ntoothpick is to transmit the downward pressure of the picture to the wall. The force on the picture is straight down to the floor,\nbut the force on the toothpick is both the picture wire pulling down and the bottom of the hole in the wall pushing up. The\ntoothpick will break off right at the wall.\nThe neck of the femur is horizontal like the toothpick in the wall. The weight of the body pushes it down near the joint, but the\nvertical diaphysis of the femur pushes it up at the other end. The neck of the femur must be strong enough to transfer the\ndownward force of the body weight horizontally to the vertical shaft of the femur (Figure 38.20).\n1096\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 38.20 Trabeculae in spongy bone are arranged such that one side of the bone bears tension and the other withstands compression.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView micrographs (http://openstax.org/l/muscle_tissue) of musculoskeletal tissues as you review the anatomy.\nCell Types in Bones\nBone consists of four types of cells: osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and osteoprogenitor cells. Osteoblasts are bone cells that\nare responsible for bone formation. Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the organic part and inorganic part of the extracellular\nmatrix of bone tissue, and collagen fibers. Osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active\nosteocytes. Osteoclasts are large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei. They remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes\nand acids that dissolve the bony matrix. These minerals, released from bones into the blood, help regulate calcium\nconcentrations in body fluids. Bone may also be resorbed for remodeling, if the applied stresses have changed. Osteocytes are\nmature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue; these cells cannot divide. Osteocytes maintain normal bone\nstructure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix. Osteoprogenitor cells are squamous stem cells that divide to produce\ndaughter cells that differentiate into osteoblasts. Osteoprogenitor cells are important in the repair of fractures.\nDevelopment of Bone\nOssification, or osteogenesis, is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts. Ossification is distinct from the process of\ncalcification; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones, it can also occur in other tissues. Ossification\nbegins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo. Before this time, the embryonic skeleton consists entirely of\nfibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. The development of bone from fibrous membranes is called intramembranous\nossification; development from hyaline cartilage is called endochondral ossification. Bone growth continues until approximately\nage 25. Bones can grow in thickness throughout life, but after age 25, ossification functions primarily in bone remodeling and\nrepair.\nIntramembranous Ossification\nIntramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. It is involved in the formation of\nthe flat bones of the skull, the mandible, and the clavicles. Ossification begins as mesenchymal cells form a template of the\nfuture bone. They then differentiate into osteoblasts at the ossification center. Osteoblasts secrete the extracellular matrix and\ndeposit calcium, which hardens the matrix. The non-mineralized portion of the bone or osteoid continues to form around blood\nvessels, forming spongy bone. Connective tissue in the matrix differentiates into red bone marrow in the fetus. The spongy bone\nis remodeled into a thin layer of compact bone on the surface of the spongy bone.\nEndochondral Ossification\nEndochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. All of the bones of the body, except for the\nflat bones of the skull, mandible, and clavicles, are formed through endochondral ossification.\n38.2 \u2022 Bone\n1097\nIn long bones, chondrocytes form a template of the hyaline cartilage diaphysis. Responding to complex developmental signals,\nthe matrix begins to calcify. This calcification prevents diffusion of nutrients into the matrix, resulting in chondrocytes dying\nand the opening up of cavities in the diaphysis cartilage. Blood vessels invade the cavities, and osteoblasts and osteoclasts\nmodify the calcified cartilage matrix into spongy bone. Osteoclasts then break down some of the spongy bone to create a\nmarrow, or medullary, cavity in the center of the diaphysis. Dense, irregular connective tissue forms a sheath (periosteum)\naround the bones. The periosteum assists in attaching the bone to surrounding tissues, tendons, and ligaments. The bone\ncontinues to grow and elongate as the cartilage cells at the epiphyses divide.\nIn the last stage of prenatal bone development, the centers of the epiphyses begin to calcify. Secondary ossification centers form\nin the epiphyses as blood vessels and osteoblasts enter these areas and convert hyaline cartilage into spongy bone. Until\nadolescence, hyaline cartilage persists at the epiphyseal plate (growth plate), which is the region between the diaphysis and\nepiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones (Figure 38.21).\nFigure 38.21 Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. The periosteum is the connective tissue\non the outside of bone that acts as the interface between bone, blood vessels, tendons, and ligaments.\nGrowth of Bone\nLong bones continue to lengthen, potentially until adolescence, through the addition of bone tissue at the epiphyseal plate. They\nalso increase in width through appositional growth.\nLengthening of Long Bones\nChondrocytes on the epiphyseal side of the epiphyseal plate divide; one cell remains undifferentiated near the epiphysis, and\none cell moves toward the diaphysis. The cells, which are pushed from the epiphysis, mature and are destroyed by calcification.\nThis process replaces cartilage with bone on the diaphyseal side of the plate, resulting in a lengthening of the bone.\nLong bones stop growing at around the age of 18 in females and the age of 21 in males in a process called epiphyseal plate\nclosure. During this process, cartilage cells stop dividing and all of the cartilage is replaced by bone. The epiphyseal plate fades,\nleaving a structure called the epiphyseal line or epiphyseal remnant, and the epiphysis and diaphysis fuse.\nThickening of Long Bones\nAppositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bony tissue at the surface of bones. Osteoblasts\nat the bone surface secrete bone matrix, and osteoclasts on the inner surface break down bone. The osteoblasts differentiate into\nosteocytes. A balance between these two processes allows the bone to thicken without becoming too heavy.\nBone Remodeling and Repair\nBone renewal continues after birth into adulthood. Bone remodeling is the replacement of old bone tissue by new bone tissue. It\ninvolves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. Normal bone growth requires\nvitamins D, C, and A, plus minerals such as calcium, phosphorous, and magnesium. Hormones such as parathyroid hormone,\ngrowth hormone, and calcitonin are also required for proper bone growth and maintenance.\nBone turnover rates are quite high, with five to seven percent of bone mass being recycled every week. Differences in turnover\nrate exist in different areas of the skeleton and in different areas of a bone. For example, the bone in the head of the femur may\nbe fully replaced every six months, whereas the bone along the shaft is altered much more slowly.\n1098\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nBone remodeling allows bones to adapt to stresses by becoming thicker and stronger when subjected to stress. Bones that are\nnot subject to normal stress, for example when a limb is in a cast, will begin to lose mass. A fractured or broken bone undergoes\nrepair through four stages:\n1.\nBlood vessels in the broken bone tear and hemorrhage, resulting in the formation of clotted blood, or a hematoma, at the\nsite of the break. The severed blood vessels at the broken ends of the bone are sealed by the clotting process, and bone cells\nthat are deprived of nutrients begin to die.\n2.\nWithin days of the fracture, capillaries grow into the hematoma, and phagocytic cells begin to clear away the dead cells.\nThough fragments of the blood clot may remain, fibroblasts and osteoblasts enter the area and begin to reform bone.\nFibroblasts produce collagen fibers that connect the broken bone ends, and osteoblasts start to form spongy bone. The\nrepair tissue between the broken bone ends is called the fibrocartilaginous callus, as it is composed of both hyaline and\nfibrocartilage (Figure 38.22). Some bone spicules may also appear at this point.\n3.\nThe fibrocartilaginous callus is converted into a bony callus of spongy bone. It takes about two months for the broken bone\nends to be firmly joined together after the fracture. This is similar to the endochondral formation of bone, as cartilage\nbecomes ossified; osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone matrix are present.\n4.\nThe bony callus is then remodelled by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, with excess material on the exterior of the bone and\nwithin the medullary cavity being removed. Compact bone is added to create bone tissue that is similar to the original,\nunbroken bone. This remodeling can take many months, and the bone may remain uneven for years.\nFigure 38.22 After this bone is set, a callus will knit the two ends together.

Conduct a literature\nsearch on diseases in which bone structure is compromised.\nHypothesis: Develop a hypothesis that states predictions of the flexibility, strength, and mass of bones that have had the calcium\nand collagen components removed. Develop a hypothesis regarding the attempt to add calcium back to decalcified bones.\nTest the hypothesis: Test the prediction by removing calcium from chicken bones by placing them in a jar of vinegar for seven\ndays. Test the hypothesis regarding adding calcium back to decalcified bone by placing the decalcified chicken bones into a jar of\nwater with calcium supplements added. Test the prediction by denaturing the collagen from the bones by baking them at 250\u00b0C\nfor three hours.\nAnalyze the data: Create a table showing the changes in bone flexibility, strength, and mass in the three different environments.\nReport the results: Under which conditions was the bone most flexible? Under which conditions was the bone the strongest?\n38.2 \u2022 Bone\n1099\nDraw a conclusion: Did the results support or refute the hypothesis? How do the results observed in this experiment correspond\nto diseases that destroy bone tissue?\n38.3 Joints and Skeletal Movement\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nClassify the different types of joints on the basis of structure\n\u2022\nExplain the role of joints in skeletal movement\nThe point at which two or more bones meet is called a joint, or articulation. Joints are responsible for movement, such as the\nmovement of limbs, and stability, such as the stability found in the bones of the skull.\nClassification of Joints on the Basis of Structure\nThere are two ways to classify joints: on the basis of their structure or on the basis of their function. The structural classification\ndivides joints into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending on the material composing the joint and the\npresence or absence of a cavity in the joint.\nFibrous Joints\nThe bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue. There is no cavity, or space, present between the bones\nand so most fibrous joints do not move at all, or are only capable of minor movements. There are three types of fibrous joints:\nsutures, syndesmoses, and gomphoses. Sutures are found only in the skull and possess short fibers of connective tissue that\nhold the skull bones tightly in place (Figure 38.23).\nFigure 38.23 Sutures are fibrous joints found only in the skull.\nSyndesmoses are joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue, allowing for more movement than in a\nsuture. An example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle. The amount of movement in these types of\njoints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers. Gomphoses occur between teeth and their sockets; the term\nrefers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg (Figure 38.24). The tooth is connected to the socket by a connective tissue\nreferred to as the periodontal ligament.\n1100\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 38.24 Gomphoses are fibrous joints between the teeth and their sockets. (credit: modification of work by Gray's Anatomy)\nCartilaginous Joints\nCartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage. There are two types of cartilaginous joints:\nsynchondroses and symphyses. In a synchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Synchondroses are found in the\nepiphyseal plates of growing bones in children. In symphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection\nbetween bones occurs through fibrocartilage. Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae. Either type of cartilaginous\njoint allows for very little movement.\nSynovial Joints\nSynovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones (Figure 38.25). This space is referred to as the\nsynovial (or joint) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid. Synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones\nand allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage, and the entire\njoint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed of connective tissue that allows movement of the joint while resisting\ndislocation. Articular capsules may also possess ligaments that hold the bones together. Synovial joints are capable of the\ngreatest movement of the three structural joint types; however, the more mobile a joint, the weaker the joint. Knees, elbows, and\nshoulders are examples of synovial joints.\n38.3 \u2022 Joints and Skeletal Movement\n1101\nFigure 38.25 Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space or \u201csynovial cavity\u201d in the joint.\nClassification of Joints on the Basis of Function\nThe functional classification divides joints into three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses. A synarthrosis\nis a joint that is immovable. This includes sutures, gomphoses, and synchondroses. Amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight\nmovement, including syndesmoses and symphyses. Diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint, as in\nsynovial joints.\nMovement at Synovial Joints\nThe wide range of movement allowed by synovial joints produces different types of movements. The movement of synovial joints\ncan be classified as one of four different types: gliding, angular, rotational, or special movement.\nGliding Movement\nGliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other. Gliding movements produce very little rotation\nor angular movement of the bones. The joints of the carpal and tarsal bones are examples of joints that produce gliding\nmovements.\nAngular Movement\nAngular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. There are several different types of\nangular movements, including flexion, extension, hyperextension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction. Flexion, or\nbending, occurs when the angle between the bones decreases. Moving the forearm upward at the elbow or moving the wrist to\nmove the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion. Extension is the opposite of flexion in that the angle between the\nbones of a joint increases. Straightening a limb after flexion is an example of extension. Extension past the regular anatomical\nposition is referred to as hyperextension. This includes moving the neck back to look upward, or bending the wrist so that the\nhand moves away from the forearm.\nAbduction occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body. Examples of abduction are moving the arms or legs\nlaterally to lift them straight out to the side. Adduction is the movement of a bone toward the midline of the body. Movement of\nthe limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction. Circumduction is the movement of a limb in a circular motion, as\nin moving the arm in a circular motion.\nRotational Movement\nRotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its longitudinal axis. Rotation can be toward the midline of\nthe body, which is referred to as medial rotation, or away from the midline of the body, which is referred to as lateral rotation.\n1102\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nMovement of the head from side to side is an example of rotation.\nSpecial Movements\nSome movements that cannot be classified as gliding, angular, or rotational are called special movements. Inversion involves\nthe soles of the feet moving inward, toward the midline of the body. Eversion is the opposite of inversion, movement of the sole\nof the foot outward, away from the midline of the body. Protraction is the anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane.\nRetraction occurs as a joint moves back into position after protraction. Protraction and retraction can be seen in the movement\nof the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards. Elevation is the movement of a bone upward, such as\nwhen the shoulders are shrugged, lifting the scapulae. Depression is the opposite of elevation\u2014movement downward of a bone,\nsuch as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position.\nDorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee. Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle\nwhen the heel is lifted, such as when standing on the toes. Supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the\nforearm so that the palm faces forward. Pronation is the opposite movement, in which the palm faces backward. Opposition is\nthe movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand, making it possible to grasp and hold objects.\nTypes of Synovial Joints\nSynovial joints are further classified into six different categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint. The shape of\nthe joint affects the type of movement permitted by the joint (Figure 38.26). These joints can be described as planar, hinge, pivot,\ncondyloid, saddle, or ball-and-socket joints.\n38.3 \u2022 Joints and Skeletal Movement\n1103\nFigure 38.26 Different types of joints allow different types of movement. Planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket are all\ntypes of synovial joints.\nPlanar Joints\nPlanar joints have bones with articulating surfaces that are flat or slightly curved faces. These joints allow for gliding\nmovements, and so the joints are sometimes referred to as gliding joints. The range of motion is limited in these joints and does\nnot involve rotation. Planar joints are found in the carpal bones in the hand and the tarsal bones of the foot, as well as between\nvertebrae (Figure 38.27).\n1104\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 38.27 The joints of the carpal bones in the wrist are examples of planar joints. (credit: modification of work by Brian C. Goss)\nHinge Joints\nIn hinge joints, the slightly rounded end of one bone fits into the slightly hollow end of the other bone. In this way, one bone\nmoves while the other remains stationary, like the hinge of a door. The elbow is an example of a hinge joint. The knee is\nsometimes classified as a modified hinge joint (Figure 38.28).\nFigure 38.28 The elbow joint, where the radius articulates with the humerus, is an example of a hinge joint. (credit: modification of work by\nBrian C. Goss)\nPivot Joints\nPivot joints consist of the rounded end of one bone fitting into a ring formed by the other bone. This structure allows rotational\nmovement, as the rounded bone moves around its own axis. An example of a pivot joint is the joint of the first and second\nvertebrae of the neck that allows the head to move back and forth (Figure 38.29). The joint of the wrist that allows the palm of the\nhand to be turned up and down is also a pivot joint.\n38.3 \u2022 Joints and Skeletal Movement\n1105\nFigure 38.29 The joint in the neck that allows the head to move back and forth is an example of a pivot joint.\nCondyloid Joints\nCondyloid joints consist of an oval-shaped end of one bone fitting into a similarly oval-shaped hollow of another bone (Figure\n38.30). This is also sometimes called an ellipsoidal joint. This type of joint allows angular movement along two axes, as seen in\nthe joints of the wrist and fingers, which can move both side to side and up and down.\nFigure 38.30 The metacarpophalangeal joints in the finger are examples of condyloid joints. (credit: modification of work by Gray's\nAnatomy)\nSaddle Joints\nSaddle joints are so named because the ends of each bone resemble a saddle, with concave and convex portions that fit together.\nSaddle joints allow angular movements similar to condyloid joints but with a greater range of motion. An example of a saddle\n1106\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\njoint is the thumb joint, which can move back and forth and up and down, but more freely than the wrist or fingers (Figure\n38.31).\nFigure 38.31 The carpometacarpal joints in the thumb are examples of saddle joints. (credit: modification of work by Brian C. Goss)\nBall-and-Socket Joints\nBall-and-socket joints possess a rounded, ball-like end of one bone fitting into a cuplike socket of another bone. This\norganization allows the greatest range of motion, as all movement types are possible in all directions. Examples of ball-and-\nsocket joints are the shoulder and hip joints (Figure 38.32).\nFigure 38.32 The shoulder joint is an example of a ball-and-socket joint.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this animation showing the six types of synovial joints.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/synovial_joints)\n38.3 \u2022 Joints and Skeletal Movement\n1107\nCAREER CONNECTION\nRheumatologist\nRheumatologists are medical doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the joints, muscles, and\nbones. They diagnose and treat diseases such as arthritis, musculoskeletal disorders, osteoporosis, and autoimmune diseases\nsuch as ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints of the hands, feet, and cervical\nspine. Affected joints become swollen, stiff, and painful. Although it is known that RA is an autoimmune disease in which the\nbody\u2019s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, the cause of RA remains unknown. Immune cells from the blood enter\njoints and the synovium causing cartilage breakdown, swelling, and inflammation of the joint lining. Breakdown of cartilage\ncauses bones to rub against each other causing pain. RA is more common in women than men and the age of onset is usually\n40\u201350 years of age.\nRheumatologists can diagnose RA on the basis of symptoms such as joint inflammation and pain, X-ray and MRI imaging, and\nblood tests. Arthrography is a type of medical imaging of joints that uses a contrast agent, such as a dye, that is opaque to X-\nrays. This allows the soft tissue structures of joints\u2014such as cartilage, tendons, and ligaments\u2014to be visualized. An arthrogram\ndiffers from a regular X-ray by showing the surface of soft tissues lining the joint in addition to joint bones. An arthrogram\nallows early degenerative changes in joint cartilage to be detected before bones become affected.\nThere is currently no cure for RA; however, rheumatologists have a number of treatment options available. Early stages can be\ntreated with rest of the affected joints by using a cane or by using joint splints that minimize inflammation. When\ninflammation has decreased, exercise can be used to strengthen the muscles that surround the joint and to maintain joint\nflexibility. If joint damage is more extensive, medications can be used to relieve pain and decrease inflammation. Anti-\ninflammatory drugs such as aspirin, topical pain relievers, and corticosteroid injections may be used. Surgery may be required\nin cases in which joint damage is severe.\n38.4 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nClassify the different types of muscle tissue\n\u2022\nExplain the role of muscles in locomotion\nMuscle cells are specialized for contraction. Muscles allow for motions such as walking, and they also facilitate bodily processes\nsuch as respiration and digestion. The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth\nmuscle (Figure 38.33).\nFigure 38.33 The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle, visualized here using\nlight microscopy. Smooth muscle cells are short, tapered at each end, and have only one plump nucleus in each. Cardiac muscle cells are\nbranched and striated, but short. The cytoplasm may branch, and they have one nucleus in the center of the cell. (credit: modification of\nwork by NCI, NIH; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nSkeletal muscle tissue forms skeletal muscles, which attach to bones or skin and control locomotion and any movement that can\nbe consciously controlled. Because it can be controlled by thought, skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle. Skeletal\nmuscles are long and cylindrical in appearance; when viewed under a microscope, skeletal muscle tissue has a striped or striated\nappearance. The striations are caused by the regular arrangement of contractile proteins (actin and myosin). Actin is a globular\n1108\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncontractile protein that interacts with myosin for muscle contraction. Skeletal muscle also has multiple nuclei present in a single\ncell.\nSmooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder, and around\npassages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels. Smooth muscle has no striations, is not under voluntary control, has\nonly one nucleus per cell, is tapered at both ends, and is called involuntary muscle.\nCardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart, and cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the body and maintain blood\npressure. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated, but unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot be consciously\ncontrolled and is called involuntary muscle. It has one nucleus per cell, is branched, and is distinguished by the presence of\nintercalated disks.\nSkeletal Muscle Fiber Structure\nEach skeletal muscle fiber is a skeletal muscle cell. These cells are incredibly large, with diameters of up to 100 \u00b5m and lengths of\nup to 30 cm. The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is called the sarcolemma. The sarcolemma is the site of action\npotential conduction, which triggers muscle contraction. Within each muscle fiber are myofibrils\u2014long cylindrical structures\nthat lie parallel to the muscle fiber. Myofibrils run the entire length of the muscle fiber, and because they are only approximately\n1.2 \u00b5m in diameter, hundreds to thousands can be found inside one muscle fiber. They attach to the sarcolemma at their ends, so\nthat as myofibrils shorten, the entire muscle cell contracts (Figure 38.34).\nFigure 38.34 A skeletal muscle cell is surrounded by a plasma membrane called the sarcolemma with a cytoplasm called the sarcoplasm.\nA muscle fiber is composed of many fibrils, packaged into orderly units.\nThe striated appearance of skeletal muscle tissue is a result of repeating bands of the proteins actin and myosin that are present\nalong the length of myofibrils. Dark A bands and light I bands repeat along myofibrils, and the alignment of myofibrils in the cell\ncauses the entire cell to appear striated or banded.\nEach I band has a dense line running vertically through the middle called a Z disc or Z line. The Z discs mark the border of units\ncalled sarcomeres, which are the functional units of skeletal muscle. One sarcomere is the space between two consecutive Z\ndiscs and contains one entire A band and two halves of an I band, one on either side of the A band. A myofibril is composed of\nmany sarcomeres running along its length, and as the sarcomeres individually contract, the myofibrils and muscle cells shorten\n(Figure 38.35).\n38.4 \u2022 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion\n1109\nFigure 38.35 A sarcomere is the region from one Z line to the next Z line. Many sarcomeres are present in a myofibril, resulting in the\nstriation pattern characteristic of skeletal muscle.\nMyofibrils are composed of smaller structures called myofilaments. There are two main types of filaments: thick filaments and\nthin filaments; each has different compositions and locations. Thick filaments occur only in the A band of a myofibril. Thin\nfilaments attach to a protein in the Z disc called alpha-actinin and occur across the entire length of the I band and partway into\nthe A band. The region at which thick and thin filaments overlap has a dense appearance, as there is little space between the\nfilaments. Thin filaments do not extend all the way into the A bands, leaving a central region of the A band that only contains\nthick filaments. This central region of the A band looks slightly lighter than the rest of the A band and is called the H zone. The\nmiddle of the H zone has a vertical line called the M line, at which accessory proteins hold together thick filaments. Both the Z\ndisc and the M line hold myofilaments in place to maintain the structural arrangement and layering of the myofibril. Myofibrils\nare connected to each other by intermediate, or desmin, filaments that attach to the Z disc.\nThick and thin filaments are themselves composed of proteins. Thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin. The tail of a\nmyosin molecule connects with other myosin molecules to form the central region of a thick filament near the M line, whereas\nthe heads align on either side of the thick filament where the thin filaments overlap. The primary component of thin filaments is\nthe actin protein. Two other components of the thin filament are tropomyosin and troponin. Actin has binding sites for myosin\nattachment. Strands of tropomyosin block the binding sites and prevent actin\u2013myosin interactions when the muscles are at\nrest. Troponin consists of three globular subunits. One subunit binds to tropomyosin, one subunit binds to actin, and one\nsubunit binds Ca2+ ions.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView this animation showing the organization of muscle fibers.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/skeletal_muscle)\nSliding Filament Model of Contraction\nFor a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten. However, thick and thin filaments\u2014the components of\nsarcomeres\u2014do not shorten. Instead, they slide by one another, causing the sarcomere to shorten while the filaments remain\nthe same length. The sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was developed to fit the differences observed in the named\nbands on the sarcomere at different degrees of muscle contraction and relaxation. The mechanism of contraction is the binding\nof myosin to actin, forming cross-bridges that generate filament movement (Figure 38.36).\n1110\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 38.36 When (a) a sarcomere (b) contracts, the Z lines move closer together and the I band gets smaller. The A band stays the same\nwidth and, at full contraction, the thin filaments overlap.\nWhen a sarcomere shortens, some regions shorten whereas others stay the same length. A sarcomere is defined as the distance\nbetween two consecutive Z discs or Z lines; when a muscle contracts, the distance between the Z discs is reduced. The H\nzone\u2014the central region of the A zone\u2014contains only thick filaments and is shortened during contraction. The I band contains\nonly thin filaments and also shortens. The A band does not shorten\u2014it remains the same length\u2014but A bands of different\nsarcomeres move closer together during contraction, eventually disappearing. Thin filaments are pulled by the thick filaments\ntoward the center of the sarcomere until the Z discs approach the thick filaments. The zone of overlap, in which thin filaments\nand thick filaments occupy the same area, increases as the thin filaments move inward.\nATP and Muscle Contraction\nThe motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to actin and pull the actin inwards. This action requires energy,\nwhich is provided by ATP. Myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the globular actin protein. Myosin has another binding site\nfor ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, releasing an inorganic phosphate molecule and energy.\nATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and myosin to detach from each other. After this happens, the newly\nbound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, Pi. The enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called ATPase. The\nenergy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin head into a \u201ccocked\u201d position. The myosin head is then in\na position for further movement, possessing potential energy, but ADP and Pi are still attached. If actin binding sites are\ncovered and unavailable, the myosin will remain in the high energy configuration with ATP hydrolyzed, but still attached.\nIf the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will form; that is, the myosin head spans the distance between the actin\n38.4 \u2022 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion\n1111\nand myosin molecules. Pi is then released, allowing myosin to expend the stored energy as a conformational change. The myosin\nhead moves toward the M line, pulling the actin along with it. As the actin is pulled, the filaments move approximately 10 nm\ntoward the M line. This movement is called the power stroke, as it is the step at which force is produced. As the actin is pulled\ntoward the M line, the sarcomere shortens and the muscle contracts.\nWhen the myosin head is \u201ccocked,\u201d it contains energy and is in a high-energy configuration. This energy is expended as the\nmyosin head moves through the power stroke; at the end of the power stroke, the myosin head is in a low-energy position. After\nthe power stroke, ADP is released; however, the cross-bridge formed is still in place, and actin and myosin are bound together.\nATP can then attach to myosin, which allows the cross-bridge cycle to start again and further muscle contraction can occur\n(Figure 38.37).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video explaining how a muscle contraction is signaled.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/contract_muscle)\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 38.37 The cross-bridge muscle contraction cycle, which is triggered by Ca2+ binding to the actin active site, is shown.

To keep actin from binding to the active site on myosin,\nregulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites. Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules, preventing\ncross-bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input. Troponin binds to tropomyosin and\nhelps to position it on the actin molecule; it also binds calcium ions.\nTo enable a muscle contraction, tropomyosin must change conformation, uncovering the myosin-binding site on an actin\nmolecule and allowing cross-bridge formation. This can only happen in the presence of calcium, which is kept at extremely low\nconcentrations in the sarcoplasm. If present, calcium ions bind to troponin, causing conformational changes in troponin that\nallow tropomyosin to move away from the myosin binding sites on actin. Once the tropomyosin is removed, a cross-bridge can\nform between actin and myosin, triggering contraction. Cross-bridge cycling continues until Ca2+ ions and ATP are no longer\navailable and tropomyosin again covers the binding sites on actin.\nExcitation\u2013Contraction Coupling\nExcitation\u2013contraction coupling is the link (transduction) between the action potential generated in the sarcolemma and the\nstart of a muscle contraction. The trigger for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural\nsignal. Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor neuron, which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to the\nmuscle. The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that interacts with the neuron is called the motor end plate. The end of\nthe neuron\u2019s axon is called the synaptic terminal, and it does not actually contact the motor end plate. A small space called the\nsynaptic cleft separates the synaptic terminal from the motor end plate. Electrical signals travel along the neuron\u2019s axon, which\nbranches through the muscle and connects to individual muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction.\nThe ability of cells to communicate electrically requires that the cells expend energy to create an electrical gradient across their\ncell membranes. This charge gradient is carried by ions, which are differentially distributed across the membrane. Each ion\nexerts an electrical influence and a concentration influence. Just as milk will eventually mix with coffee without the need to stir,\nions also distribute themselves evenly, if they are permitted to do so. In this case, they are not permitted to return to an evenly\nmixed state.\nThe sodium\u2013potassium ATPase uses cellular energy to move K+ ions inside the cell and Na+ ions outside. This alone accumulates\na small electrical charge, but a big concentration gradient. There is lots of K+ in the cell and lots of Na+ outside the cell.\nPotassium is able to leave the cell through K+ channels that are open 90% of the time, and it does. However, Na+ channels are\nrarely open, so Na+ remains outside the cell. When K+ leaves the cell, obeying its concentration gradient, that effectively leaves a\nnegative charge behind. So at rest, there is a large concentration gradient for Na+ to enter the cell, and there is an accumulation\nof negative charges left behind in the cell. This is the resting membrane potential. Potential in this context means a separation of\nelectrical charge that is capable of doing work. It is measured in volts, just like a battery. However, the transmembrane potential\nis considerably smaller (0.07 V); therefore, the small value is expressed as millivolts (mV) or 70 mV. Because the inside of a cell is\nnegative compared with the outside, a minus sign signifies the excess of negative charges inside the cell, \u221270 mV.\nIf an event changes the permeability of the membrane to Na+ ions, they will enter the cell. That will change the voltage. This is an\nelectrical event, called an action potential, that can be used as a cellular signal. Communication occurs between nerves and\nmuscles through neurotransmitters. Neuron action potentials cause the release of neurotransmitters from the synaptic\nterminal into the synaptic cleft, where they can then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to a receptor molecule on the\nmotor end plate. The motor end plate possesses junctional folds\u2014folds in the sarcolemma that create a large surface area for the\nneurotransmitter to bind to receptors. The receptors are actually sodium channels that open to allow the passage of Na+ into the\ncell when they receive a neurotransmitter signal.\nAcetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter released by motor neurons that binds to receptors in the motor end plate.\n38.4 \u2022 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion\n1113\nNeurotransmitter release occurs when an action potential travels down the motor neuron\u2019s axon, resulting in altered\npermeability of the synaptic terminal membrane and an influx of calcium. The Ca2+ ions allow synaptic vesicles to move to and\nbind with the presynaptic membrane (on the neuron), and release neurotransmitter from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft.\nOnce released by the synaptic terminal, ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft to the motor end plate, where it binds with ACh\nreceptors. As a neurotransmitter binds, these ion channels open, and Na+ ions cross the membrane into the muscle cell. This\nreduces the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell, which is called depolarization. As ACh binds at the\nmotor end plate, this depolarization is called an end-plate potential. The depolarization then spreads along the sarcolemma,\ncreating an action potential as sodium channels adjacent to the initial depolarization site sense the change in voltage and open.\nThe action potential moves across the entire cell, creating a wave of depolarization.\nACh is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) into acetyl and choline. AChE resides in the synaptic cleft,\nbreaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh receptors, which would cause unwanted extended muscle\ncontraction (Figure 38.38).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 38.38 This diagram shows excitation-contraction coupling in a skeletal muscle contraction. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is a\nspecialized endoplasmic reticulum found in muscle cells.\nThe deadly nerve gas Sarin irreversibly inhibits Acetylcholinesterase. What effect would Sarin have on muscle contraction?\nAfter depolarization, the membrane returns to its resting state. This is called repolarization, during which voltage-gated\nsodium channels close. Potassium channels continue at 90% conductance. Because the plasma membrane sodium\u2013potassium\nATPase always transports ions, the resting state (negatively charged inside relative to the outside) is restored. The period\n1114\nChapter 38 \u2022 The Musculoskeletal System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nimmediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or muscle cell regains its ability to\ntransmit another impulse, is called the refractory period. During the refractory period, the membrane cannot generate another\naction potential. The refractory period allows the voltage-sensitive ion channels to return to their resting configurations. The\nsodium potassium ATPase continually moves Na+ back out of the cell and K+ back into the cell, and the K+ leaks out leaving\nnegative charge behind. Very quickly, the membrane repolarizes, so that it can again be depolarized.\nControl of Muscle Tension\nNeural control initiates the formation of actin\u2013myosin cross-bridges, leading to the sarcomere shortening involved in muscle\ncontraction. These contractions extend from the muscle fiber through connective tissue to pull on bones, causing skeletal\nmovement. The pull exerted by a muscle is called tension, and the amount of force created by this tension can vary. This enables\nthe same muscles to move very light objects and very heavy objects. In individual muscle fibers, the amount of tension produced\ndepends on the cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber and the frequency of neural stimulation.\nThe number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin determine the amount of tension that a muscle fiber can\nproduce. Cross-bridges can only form where thick and thin filaments overlap, allowing myosin to bind to actin. If more cross-\nbridges are formed, more myosin will pull on actin, and more tension will be produced.\nThe ideal length of a sarcomere during production of maximal tension occurs when thick and thin filaments overlap to the\ngreatest degree. If a sarcomere at rest is stretched past an ideal resting length, thick and thin filaments do not overlap to the\ngreatest degree, and fewer cross-bridges can form. This results in fewer myosin heads pulling on actin, and less tension is\nproduced. As a sarcomere is shortened, the zone of overlap is reduced as the thin filaments reach the H zone, which is composed\nof myosin tails. Because it is myosin heads that form cross-bridges, actin will not bind to myosin in this zone, reducing the\ntension produced by this myofiber. If the sarcomere is shortened even more, thin filaments begin to overlap with each\nother\u2014reducing cross-bridge formation even further, and producing even less tension. Conversely, if the sarcomere is stretched\nto the point at which thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no cross-bridges are formed and no tension is produced. This\namount of stretching does not usually occur because accessory proteins, internal sensory nerves, and connective tissue oppose\nextreme stretching.\nThe primary variable determining force production is the number of myofibers within the muscle that receive an action\npotential from the neuron that controls that fiber. When using the biceps to pick up a pencil, the motor cortex of the brain only\nsignals a few neurons of the biceps, and only a few myofibers respond. In vertebrates, each myofiber responds fully if\nstimulated. When picking up a piano, the motor cortex signals all of the neurons in the biceps and every myofiber participates.\nThis is close to the maximum force the muscle can produce. As mentioned above, increasing the frequency of action potentials\n(the number of signals per second) can increase the force a bit more, because the tropomyosin is flooded with calcium.\n38.4 \u2022 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion\n1115\n", "key_terms": "\nabduction\nwhen a bone moves away from the midline of\nthe body\nacetylcholinesterase\n(AChE) enzyme that breaks down ACh\ninto acetyl and choline\nactin\nglobular contractile protein that interacts with\nmyosin for muscle contraction\nadduction\nmovement of the limbs inward after abduction\namphiarthrosis\njoint that allows slight movement;

A hydrostatic skeleton is\nformed by a fluid-filled compartment held under hydrostatic\npressure; movement is created by the muscles producing\npressure on the fluid. An exoskeleton is a hard external\nskeleton that protects the outer surface of an organism and\nenables movement through muscles attached on the inside.\nAn endoskeleton is an internal skeleton composed of hard,\nmineralized tissue that also enables movement by\nattachment to muscles. The human skeleton is an\nendoskeleton that is composed of the axial and appendicular\nskeleton. The axial skeleton is composed of the bones of the\nskull, ossicles of the ear, hyoid bone, vertebral column, and\nribcage. The skull consists of eight cranial bones and 14 facial\nbones. Six bones make up the ossicles of the middle ear,\nwhile the hyoid bone is located in the neck under the\nmandible. The vertebral column contains 26 bones, and it\nsurrounds and protects the spinal cord. The thoracic cage\nconsists of the sternum, ribs, thoracic vertebrae, and costal\ncartilages. The appendicular skeleton is made up of the limbs\nof the upper and lower limbs. The pectoral girdle is\ncomposed of the clavicles and the scapulae. The upper limb\ncontains 30 bones in the arm, the forearm, and the hand. The\npelvic girdle attaches the lower limbs to the axial skeleton.\nThe lower limb includes the bones of the thigh, the leg, and\nthe foot.\n38.2 Bone\nBone, or osseous tissue, is connective tissue that includes\nspecialized cells, mineral salts, and collagen fibers. The\nhuman skeleton can be divided into long bones, short bones,\nflat bones, and irregular bones. Compact bone tissue is\ncomposed of osteons and forms the external layer of all\nbones. Spongy bone tissue is composed of trabeculae and\nforms the inner part of all bones. Four types of cells compose\nbony tissue: osteocytes, osteoclasts, osteoprogenitor cells,\nand osteoblasts. Ossification is the process of bone\nformation by osteoblasts. Intramembranous ossification is\nthe process of bone development from fibrous membranes.\nEndochondral ossification is the process of bone\ndevelopment from hyaline cartilage. Long bones lengthen as\nchondrocytes divide and secrete hyaline cartilage.\nOsteoblasts replace cartilage with bone. Appositional growth\nis the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of\nbone tissue at the surface of bones. Bone remodeling\ninvolves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and\nbone resorption by osteoclasts. Bone repair occurs in four\nstages and can take several months.\n38.3 Joints and Skeletal Movement\nThe structural classification of joints divides them into bony,\nfibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints. The bones of\nfibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue;\nthe three types of fibrous joints are sutures, syndesomes,\nand gomphoses. Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the\nbones are connected by cartilage; the two types of\ncartilaginous joints are synchondroses and symphyses.\nSynovial joints are joints that have a space between the\nadjoining bones. The functional classification divides joints\ninto three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and\ndiarthroses. The movement of synovial joints can be\nclassified as one of four different types: gliding, angular,\nrotational, or special movement. Gliding movements occur\nas relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other. Angular\nmovements are produced when the angle between the bones\nof a joint changes. Rotational movement is the movement of\na bone as it rotates around its own longitudinal axis. Special\nmovements include inversion, eversion, protraction,\nretraction, elevation, depression, dorsiflexion, plantar\nflexion, supination, pronation, and opposition. Synovial\njoints are also classified into six different categories on the\nbasis of the shape and structure of the joint: planar, hinge,\n1118\nChapter 38 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\npivot, condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket.\n38.4 Muscle Contraction and\nLocomotion\nThe body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal\nmuscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Skeleton\nmuscle tissue is composed of sarcomeres, the functional\nunits of muscle tissue. Muscle contraction occurs when\nsarcomeres shorten, as thick and thin filaments slide past\neach other, which is called the sliding filament model of\nmuscle contraction. ATP provides the energy for cross-\nbridge formation and filament sliding. Regulatory proteins,\nsuch as troponin and tropomyosin, control cross-bridge\nformation. Excitation\u2013contraction coupling transduces the\nelectrical signal of the neuron, via acetylcholine, to an\nelectrical signal on the muscle membrane, which initiates\nforce production. The number of muscle fibers contracting\ndetermines how much force the whole muscle produces.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

The left lung is smaller than the right\nlung to accommodate space for the heart. A dog\u2019s nose (right) has a slit on the side of each nostril.\nWhen tracking a scent, the slits open, blocking the front of the nostrils. This allows the dog to\nexhale though the now-open area on the side of the nostrils without losing the scent that is being\nfollowed. (credit a: modification of work by Geoff Stearns; credit b: modification of work by Cory\nZanker)\nINTRODUCTION Breathing is an involuntary event. How often a breath is taken and how much air is\ninhaled or exhaled are tightly regulated by the respiratory center in the brain. Humans, when they aren\u2019t\nexerting themselves, breathe approximately 15 times per minute on average. Canines, like the dog in\nFigure 39.1, have a respiratory rate of about 15\u201330 breaths per minute. With every inhalation, air fills the\nlungs, and with every exhalation, air rushes back out. That air is doing more than just inflating and\ndeflating the lungs in the chest cavity. The air contains oxygen that crosses the lung tissue, enters the\nbloodstream, and travels to organs and tissues. Oxygen (O2) enters the cells where it is used for\nmetabolic reactions that produce ATP, a high-energy compound. At the same time, these reactions\nrelease carbon dioxide (CO2) as a by-product. CO2is toxic and must be eliminated. Carbon dioxide exits\nthe cells, enters the bloodstream, travels back to the lungs, and is expired out of the body during\nexhalation.\nChapter Outline\n39.1 Systems of Gas\nExchange\n39.2 Gas Exchange\nacross Respiratory\nSurfaces\n39.3 Breathing\n39.4 Transport of Gases\nin Human Bodily\nFluids\n39.1 Systems of Gas Exchange\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the passage of air from the outside environment to the lungs\n\u2022\nExplain how the lungs are protected from particulate matter\nThe primary function of the respiratory system is to deliver oxygen to the cells of the body\u2019s tissues and\nremove carbon dioxide, a cell waste product. The main structures of the human respiratory system are the\nnasal cavity, the trachea, and lungs.\nAll aerobic organisms require oxygen to carry out their metabolic functions. Along the evolutionary tree,\ndifferent organisms have devised different means of obtaining oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere.\nThe environment in which the animal lives greatly determines how an animal respires. The complexity of the\nrespiratory system is correlated with the size of the organism. As animal size increases, diffusion distances\nincrease and the ratio of surface area to volume drops. In unicellular organisms, diffusion across the cell\nmembrane is sufficient for supplying oxygen to the cell (Figure 39.2). Diffusion is a slow, passive transport\nprocess. In order for diffusion to be a feasible means of providing oxygen to the cell, the rate of oxygen\nuptake must match the rate of diffusion across the membrane. In other words, if the cell were very large or\nthick, diffusion would not be able to provide oxygen quickly enough to the inside of the cell. Therefore,\ndependence on diffusion as a means of obtaining oxygen and removing carbon dioxide remains feasible only\nfor small organisms or those with highly-flattened bodies, such as many flatworms (Platyhelminthes).\nLarger organisms had to evolve specialized respiratory tissues, such as gills, lungs, and respiratory passages\naccompanied by complex circulatory systems, to transport oxygen throughout their entire body.\nFigure 39.2 The cell of the unicellular alga Ventricaria ventricosa is one of the largest known, reaching one to five\ncentimeters in diameter. Like all single-celled organisms, V. ventricosa exchanges gases across the cell membrane.\nDirect Diffusion\nFor small multicellular organisms, diffusion across the outer membrane is sufficient to meet their oxygen\nneeds. Gas exchange by direct diffusion across surface membranes is efficient for organisms less than 1 mm\nin diameter. In simple organisms, such as cnidarians and flatworms, every cell in the body is close to the\nexternal environment. Their cells are kept moist and gases diffuse quickly via direct diffusion. Flatworms are\nsmall, literally flat worms, which \u2018breathe\u2019 through diffusion across the outer membrane (Figure 39.3). The\nflat shape of these organisms increases the surface area for diffusion, ensuring that each cell within the body\nis close to the outer membrane surface and has access to oxygen. If the flatworm had a cylindrical body, then\nthe cells in the center would not be able to get oxygen.\n1124\nChapter 39 \u2022 The Respiratory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 39.3 This flatworm\u2019s process of respiration works by diffusion across the outer membrane. (credit: Stephen Childs)\nSkin and Gills\nEarthworms and amphibians use their skin (integument) as a respiratory organ. A dense network of capillaries lies just below\nthe skin and facilitates gas exchange between the external environment and the circulatory system. The respiratory surface must\nbe kept moist in order for the gases to dissolve and diffuse across cell membranes.\nOrganisms that live in water need to obtain oxygen from the water. Oxygen dissolves in water but at a lower concentration than\nin the atmosphere. The atmosphere has roughly 21 percent oxygen. In water, the oxygen concentration is much lower than that.\nFish and many other aquatic organisms have evolved gills to take up the dissolved oxygen from water (Figure 39.4). Gills are thin\ntissue filaments that are highly branched and folded. When water passes over the gills, the dissolved oxygen in water rapidly\ndiffuses across the gills into the bloodstream. The circulatory system can then carry the oxygenated blood to the other parts of\nthe body. In animals that contain coelomic fluid instead of blood, oxygen diffuses across the gill surfaces into the coelomic fluid.\nGills are found in mollusks, annelids, and crustaceans.\nFigure 39.4 This common carp, like many other aquatic organisms, has gills that allow it to obtain oxygen from water. (credit:\n\"Guitardude012\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nThe folded surfaces of the gills provide a large surface area to ensure that the fish gets sufficient oxygen. Diffusion is a process in\nwhich material travels from regions of high concentration to low concentration until equilibrium is reached. In this case, blood\nwith a low concentration of oxygen molecules circulates through the gills. The concentration of oxygen molecules in water is\nhigher than the concentration of oxygen molecules in gills. As a result, oxygen molecules diffuse from water (high\nconcentration) to blood (low concentration), as shown in Figure 39.5. Similarly, carbon dioxide molecules in the blood diffuse\nfrom the blood (high concentration) to water (low concentration).\n39.1 \u2022 Systems of Gas Exchange\n1125\nFigure 39.5 As water flows over the gills, oxygen is transferred to blood via the veins. (credit \"fish\": modification of work by Duane Raver,\nNOAA)\nTracheal Systems\nInsect respiration is independent of its circulatory system; therefore, the blood does not play a direct role in oxygen transport.\nInsects have a highly specialized type of respiratory system called the tracheal system, which consists of a network of small\ntubes that carries oxygen to the entire body. The tracheal system is the most direct and efficient respiratory system in active\nanimals. The tubes in the tracheal system are made of a polymeric material called chitin.\nInsect bodies have openings, called spiracles, along the thorax and abdomen. These openings connect to the tubular network,\nallowing oxygen to pass into the body (Figure 39.6) and regulating the diffusion of CO2 and water vapor. Air enters and leaves the\ntracheal system through the spiracles. Some insects can ventilate the tracheal system with body movements.\nFigure 39.6 Insects perform respiration via a tracheal system.\nMammalian Systems\nIn mammals, pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation (breathing). During inhalation, air enters the body through the nasal\ncavity located just inside the nose (Figure 39.7). As air passes through the nasal cavity, the air is warmed to body temperature\nand humidified. The respiratory tract is coated with mucus to seal the tissues from direct contact with air. Mucus is high in\nwater. As air crosses these surfaces of the mucous membranes, it picks up water. These processes help equilibrate the air to the\nbody conditions, reducing any damage that cold, dry air can cause. Particulate matter that is floating in the air is removed in the\nnasal passages via mucus and cilia. The processes of warming, humidifying, and removing particles are important protective\nmechanisms that prevent damage to the trachea and lungs. Thus, inhalation serves several purposes in addition to bringing\noxygen into the respiratory system.\n1126\nChapter 39 \u2022 The Respiratory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 39.7 Air enters the respiratory system through the nasal cavity and pharynx, and then passes through the trachea and into the\nbronchi, which bring air into the lungs.

The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body.\nThe human trachea is a cylinder about 10 to 12 cm long and 2 cm in diameter that sits in front of the esophagus and extends from\nthe larynx into the chest cavity where it divides into the two primary bronchi at the midthorax. It is made of incomplete rings of\nhyaline cartilage and smooth muscle (Figure 39.8). The trachea is lined with mucus-producing goblet cells and ciliated epithelia.\nThe cilia propel foreign particles trapped in the mucus toward the pharynx. The cartilage provides strength and support to the\ntrachea to keep the passage open. The smooth muscle can contract, decreasing the trachea\u2019s diameter, which causes expired air\nto rush upwards from the lungs at a great force. The forced exhalation helps expel mucus when we cough. Smooth muscle can\ncontract or relax, depending on stimuli from the external environment or the body\u2019s nervous system.\n39.1 \u2022 Systems of Gas Exchange\n1127\nFigure 39.8 The trachea and bronchi are made of incomplete rings of cartilage. (credit: modification of work by Gray's Anatomy)\nLungs: Bronchi and Alveoli\nThe end of the trachea bifurcates (divides) to the right and left lungs. The lungs are not identical. The right lung is larger and\ncontains three lobes, whereas the smaller left lung contains two lobes (Figure 39.9). The muscular diaphragm, which facilitates\nbreathing, is inferior to (below) the lungs and marks the end of the thoracic cavity.\nFigure 39.9 The trachea bifurcates into the right and left bronchi in the lungs. The right lung is made of three lobes and is larger. To\naccommodate the heart, the left lung is smaller and has only two lobes.\nIn the lungs, air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages, or bronchi. Air enters the lungs through the two primary (main)\nbronchi (singular: bronchus). Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi, then into tertiary bronchi, which in turn divide,\ncreating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung. Like the trachea, the bronchi are\nmade of cartilage and smooth muscle. At the bronchioles, the cartilage is replaced with elastic fibers. Bronchi are innervated by\nnerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction (parasympathetic) or\nrelaxation (sympathetic) in the bronchi and bronchioles, depending on the nervous system\u2019s cues. In humans, bronchioles with a\ndiameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the respiratory bronchioles. They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support\ntheir shape. As the passageways decrease in diameter, the relative amount of smooth muscle increases.\nThe terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles\nsubdivide into several alveolar ducts. Numerous alveoli and alveolar sacs surround the alveolar ducts. The alveolar sacs resemble\nbunches of grapes tethered to the end of the bronchioles (Figure 39.10). In the acinar region, the alveolar ducts are attached to\nthe end of each bronchiole. At the end of each duct are approximately 100 alveolar sacs, each containing 20 to 30 alveoli that are\n200 to 300 microns in diameter. Gas exchange occurs only in alveoli. Alveoli are made of thin-walled parenchymal cells, typically\none-cell thick, that look like tiny bubbles within the sacs. Alveoli are in direct contact with capillaries (one-cell thick) of the\n1128\nChapter 39 \u2022 The Respiratory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncirculatory system. Such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from alveoli into the blood and be distributed to the\ncells of the body. In addition, the carbon dioxide that was produced by cells as a waste product will diffuse from the blood into\nalveoli to be exhaled. The anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli emphasizes the structural and functional\nrelationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems. Because there are so many alveoli (~300 million per lung) within each\nalveolar sac and so many sacs at the end of each alveolar duct, the lungs have a sponge-like consistency. This organization\nproduces a very large surface area that is available for gas exchange. The surface area of alveoli in the lungs is approximately 75\nm2. This large surface area, combined with the thin-walled nature of the alveolar parenchymal cells, allows gases to easily diffuse\nacross the cells.\nFigure 39.10 Terminal bronchioles are connected by respiratory bronchioles to alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs. Each alveolar sac contains\n20 to 30 spherical alveoli and has the appearance of a bunch of grapes. Air flows into the atrium of the alveolar sac, then circulates into\nalveoli where gas exchange occurs with the capillaries. Mucous glands secrete mucous into the airways, keeping them moist and flexible.\n(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch the following video to review the respiratory system.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/lungs_pulmonary)\nProtective Mechanisms\nThe air that organisms breathe contains particulate matter such as dust, dirt, viral particles, and bacteria that can damage the\nlungs or trigger allergic immune responses. The respiratory system contains several protective mechanisms to avoid problems\nor tissue damage. In the nasal cavity, hairs and mucus trap small particles, viruses, bacteria, dust, and dirt to prevent their\nentry.\nIf particulates do make it beyond the nose, or enter through the mouth, the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs also contain\nseveral protective devices. The lungs produce mucus\u2014a sticky substance made of mucin, a complex glycoprotein, as well as salts\nand water\u2014that traps particulates. The bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia, small hair-like projections that line the walls of\nthe bronchi and bronchioles (Figure 39.11). These cilia beat in unison and move mucus and particles out of the bronchi and\nbronchioles back up to the throat where it is swallowed and eliminated via the esophagus.\n39.1 \u2022 Systems of Gas Exchange\n1129\nIn humans, for example, tar and other substances in cigarette smoke destroy or paralyze the cilia, making the removal of\nparticles more difficult. In addition, smoking causes the lungs to produce more mucus, which the damaged cilia are not able to\nmove. This causes a persistent cough, as the lungs try to rid themselves of particulate matter, and makes smokers more\nsusceptible to respiratory ailments.\nFigure 39.11 The bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia that help move mucus and other particles out of the lungs. (credit: Louisa Howard,\nmodification of work by Dartmouth Electron Microscope Facility)\n39.2 Gas Exchange across Respiratory Surfaces\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nName and describe lung volumes and capacities\n\u2022\nUnderstand how gas pressure influences how gases move into and out of the body\nThe structure of the lung maximizes its surface area to increase gas diffusion. Because of the enormous number of alveoli\n(approximately 300 million in each human lung), the surface area of the lung is very large (75 m2). Having such a large surface\narea increases the amount of gas that can diffuse into and out of the lungs.\nBasic Principles of Gas Exchange\nGas exchange during respiration occurs primarily through diffusion. Diffusion is a process in which transport is driven by a\nconcentration gradient. Gas molecules move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. Blood that is\nlow in oxygen concentration and high in carbon dioxide concentration undergoes gas exchange with air in the lungs. The air in\nthe lungs has a higher concentration of oxygen than that of oxygen-depleted blood and a lower concentration of carbon dioxide.\nThis concentration gradient allows for gas exchange during respiration.\nPartial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases. The total pressure exerted\nby the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture. The rate of diffusion of a gas is proportional\nto its partial pressure within the total gas mixture. This concept is discussed further in detail below.\nLung Volumes and Capacities\nDifferent animals have different lung capacities based on their activities. Cheetahs have evolved a much higher lung capacity\nthan humans; it helps provide oxygen to all the muscles in the body and allows them to run very fast. Elephants also have a high\nlung capacity. In this case, it is not because they run fast but because they have a large body and must be able to take up oxygen\nin accordance with their body size.\nHuman lung size is determined by genetics, sex, and height. At maximal capacity, an average lung can hold almost six liters of\nair, but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity. Air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung volumes and lung\ncapacities (Figure 39.12 and Table 39.1). Volume measures the amount of air for one function (such as inhalation or exhalation).\nCapacity is any two or more volumes (for example, how much can be inhaled from the end of a maximal exhalation).\n1130\nChapter 39 \u2022 The Respiratory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 39.12 Human lung volumes and capacities are shown. The total lung capacity of the adult male is six liters. Tidal volume is the\nvolume of air inhaled in a single, normal breath. Inspiratory capacity is the amount of air taken in during a deep breath, and residual volume\nis the amount of air left in the lungs after forceful respiration.\nLung Volumes and Capacities (Avg Adult Male)\nVolume/Capacity\nDefinition\nVolume\n(liters)\nEquations\nTidal volume (TV)\nAmount of air inhaled during a normal breath\n0.5\n-\nExpiratory reserve\nvolume (ERV)\nAmount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation\n1.2\n-\nInspiratory reserve\nvolume (IRV)\nAmount of air that can be further inhaled after a normal\ninhalation\n3.1\n-\nResidual volume (RV)\nAir left in the lungs after a forced exhalation\n1.2\n-\nVital capacity (VC)\nMaximum amount of air that can be moved in or out of the\nlungs in a single respiratory cycle\n4.8\nERV+TV+IRV\nInspiratory capacity\n(IC)\nVolume of air that can be inhaled in addition to a normal\nexhalation\n3.6\nTV+IRV\nFunctional residual\ncapacity (FRC)\nVolume of air remaining after a normal exhalation\n2.4\nERV+RV\nTotal lung capacity\n(TLC)\nTotal volume of air in the lungs after a maximal inspiration\n6.0\nRV+ERV+TV+IRV\nForced expiratory\nvolume (FEV1)\nHow much air can be forced out of the lungs over a specific\ntime period, usually one second\n~4.1 to 5.5\n-\nTable 39.1\nThe volume in the lung can be divided into four units: tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume, inspiratory reserve volume, and\n39.2 \u2022 Gas Exchange across Respiratory Surfaces\n1131\nresidual volume. Tidal volume (TV) measures the amount of air that is inspired and expired during a normal breath. On\naverage, this volume is around one-half liter, which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle. The expiratory\nreserve volume (ERV) is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation. It is the reserve amount that\ncan be exhaled beyond what is normal. Conversely, the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) is the additional amount of air that can\nbe inhaled after a normal inhalation. The residual volume (RV) is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is\nexhaled. The lungs are never completely empty: There is always some air left in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. If this\nresidual volume did not exist and the lungs emptied completely, the lung tissues would stick together and the energy necessary\nto reinflate the lung could be too great to overcome. Therefore, there is always some air remaining in the lungs. Residual volume\nis also important for preventing large fluctuations in respiratory gases (O2 and CO2). The residual volume is the only lung\nvolume that cannot be measured directly because it is impossible to completely empty the lung of air. This volume can only be\ncalculated rather than measured.\nCapacities are measurements of two or more volumes. The vital capacity (VC) measures the maximum amount of air that can be\ninhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle. It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and inspiratory\nreserve volume. The inspiratory capacity (IC) is the amount of air that can be inhaled after the end of a normal expiration. It is,\ntherefore, the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume. The functional residual capacity (FRC) includes the\nexpiratory reserve volume and the residual volume. The FRC measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a\nnormal exhalation. Lastly, the total lung capacity (TLC) is a measurement of the total amount of air that the lung can hold. It is\nthe sum of the residual volume, expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and inspiratory reserve volume.\nLung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry. An important measurement taken during spirometry is the\nforced expiratory volume (FEV), which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period, usually one\nsecond (FEV1). In addition, the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled, is\nmeasured. The ratio of these values (FEV1/FVC ratio) is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma, emphysema, and\nfibrosis. If the FEV1/FVC ratio is high, the lungs are not compliant (meaning they are stiff and unable to bend properly), and the\npatient most likely has lung fibrosis. Patients exhale most of the lung volume very quickly. Conversely, when the FEV1/FVC ratio\nis low, there is resistance in the lung that is characteristic of asthma. In this instance, it is hard for the patient to get the air out\nof his or her lungs, and it takes a long time to reach the maximal exhalation volume. In either case, breathing is difficult and\ncomplications arise.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nRespiratory Therapist\nRespiratory therapists or respiratory practitioners evaluate and treat patients with lung and cardiovascular diseases. They work\nas part of a medical team to develop treatment plans for patients. Respiratory therapists may treat premature babies with\nunderdeveloped lungs, patients with chronic conditions such as asthma, or older patients suffering from lung disease such as\nemphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They may operate advanced equipment such as compressed\ngas delivery systems, ventilators, blood gas analyzers, and resuscitators. Specialized programs to become a respiratory therapist\ngenerally lead to a bachelor\u2019s degree with a respiratory therapist specialty. Because of a growing aging population, career\nopportunities as a respiratory therapist are expected to remain strong.\nGas Pressure and Respiration\nThe respiratory process can be better understood by examining the properties of gases. Gases move freely, but gas particles are\nconstantly hitting the walls of their vessel, thereby producing gas pressure.\nAir is a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen (N2; 78.6 percent), oxygen (O2; 20.9 percent), water vapor (H2O; 0.5 percent), and\ncarbon dioxide (CO2; 0.04 percent). Each gas component of that mixture exerts a pressure. The pressure for an individual gas in\nthe mixture is the partial pressure of that gas. Approximately 21 percent of atmospheric gas is oxygen. Carbon dioxide, however,\nis found in relatively small amounts, 0.04 percent. The partial pressure for oxygen is much greater than that of carbon dioxide.\nThe partial pressure of any gas can be calculated by:\nPatm, the atmospheric pressure, is the sum of all of the partial pressures of the atmospheric gases added together,\n1132\nChapter 39 \u2022 The Respiratory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\u00d7 (percent content in mixture).\nThe pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 760 mm Hg. Therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen is:\nand for carbon dioxide:\nAt high altitudes, Patm decreases but concentration does not change; the partial pressure decrease is due to the reduction in\nPatm.\nWhen the air mixture reaches the lung, it has been humidified. The pressure of the water vapor in the lung does not change the\npressure of the air, but it must be included in the partial pressure equation. For this calculation, the water pressure (47 mm Hg)\nis subtracted from the atmospheric pressure:\nand the partial pressure of oxygen is:\nThese pressures determine the gas exchange, or the flow of gas, in the system. Oxygen and carbon dioxide will flow according to\ntheir pressure gradient from high to low. Therefore, understanding the partial pressure of each gas will aid in understanding\nhow gases move in the respiratory system.\nGas Exchange across the Alveoli\nIn the body, oxygen is used by cells of the body\u2019s tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product. The ratio of carbon\ndioxide production to oxygen consumption is the respiratory quotient (RQ). RQ varies between 0.7 and 1.0. If just glucose were\nused to fuel the body, the RQ would equal one. One mole of carbon dioxide would be produced for every mole of oxygen\nconsumed. Glucose, however, is not the only fuel for the body. Protein and fat are also used as fuels for the body. Because of this,\nless carbon dioxide is produced than oxygen is consumed and the RQ is, on average, about 0.7 for fat and about 0.8 for protein.\nThe RQ is used to calculate the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar spaces within the lung, the alveolar\n. Above, the\npartial pressure of oxygen in the lungs was calculated to be 150 mm Hg. However, lungs never fully deflate with an exhalation;\ntherefore, the inspired air mixes with this residual air and lowers the partial pressure of oxygen within the alveoli. This means\nthat there is a lower concentration of oxygen in the lungs than is found in the air outside the body. Knowing the RQ, the partial\npressure of oxygen in the alveoli can be calculated:\nWith an RQ of 0.8 and a\nin the alveoli of 40 mm Hg, the alveolar\nis equal to:\nNotice that this pressure is less than the external air. Therefore, the oxygen will flow from the inspired air in the lung (\n= 150\nmm Hg) into the bloodstream (\n= 100 mm Hg) (Figure 39.13).\nIn the lungs, oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. Oxygen (about 98 percent) binds\nreversibly to the respiratory pigment hemoglobin found in red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs carry oxygen to the tissues where\noxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and diffuses into the cells of the tissues. More specifically, alveolar\nis higher in the\nalveoli (\n= 100 mm Hg) than blood\n(40 mm Hg) in the capillaries. Because this pressure gradient exists, oxygen\ndiffuses down its pressure gradient, moving out of the alveoli and entering the blood of the capillaries where O2 binds to\nhemoglobin. At the same time, alveolar\nis lower\n= 40 mm Hg than blood\n= (45 mm Hg). CO2 diffuses down\nits pressure gradient, moving out of the capillaries and entering the alveoli.\nOxygen and carbon dioxide move independently of each other; they diffuse down their own pressure gradients. As blood leaves\nthe lungs through the pulmonary veins, the venous\n= 100 mm Hg, whereas the venous\n= 40 mm Hg. As blood enters\n39.2 \u2022 Gas Exchange across Respiratory Surfaces\n1133\nthe systemic capillaries, the blood will lose oxygen and gain carbon dioxide because of the pressure difference of the tissues and\nblood. In systemic capillaries,\n= 100 mm Hg, but in the tissue cells,\n= 40 mm Hg. This pressure gradient drives the\ndiffusion of oxygen out of the capillaries and into the tissue cells. At the same time, blood\n= 40 mm Hg and systemic tissue\n= 45 mm Hg. The pressure gradient drives CO2 out of tissue cells and into the capillaries. The blood returning to the lungs\nthrough the pulmonary arteries has a venous\n= 40 mm Hg and a\n= 45 mm Hg. The blood enters the lung capillaries\nwhere the process of exchanging gases between the capillaries and alveoli begins again (Figure 39.13).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 39.13 The partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide change as blood moves through the body.\nWhich of the following statements is false?\na.\nIn the tissues,\ndrops as blood passes from the arteries to the veins, while\nincreases.\nb.\nBlood travels from the lungs to the heart to body tissues, then back to the heart, then the lungs.\nc.\nBlood travels from the lungs to the heart to body tissues, then back to the lungs, then the heart.\nd.\nis higher in air than in the lungs.\nIn short, the change in partial pressure from the alveoli to the capillaries drives the oxygen into the tissues and the carbon\ndioxide into the blood from the tissues. The blood is then transported to the lungs where differences in pressure in the alveoli\nresult in the movement of carbon dioxide out of the blood into the lungs, and oxygen into the blood.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video to learn how to carry out spirometry.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/spirometry)\n39.3 Breathing\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe how the structures of the lungs and thoracic cavity control the mechanics of breathing\n\u2022\nExplain the importance of compliance and resistance in the lungs\n\u2022\nDiscuss problems that may arise due to a V/Q mismatch\n1134\nChapter 39 \u2022 The Respiratory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nMammalian lungs are located in the thoracic cavity where they are surrounded and protected by the rib cage, intercostal\nmuscles, and bound by the chest wall. The bottom of the lungs is contained by the diaphragm, a skeletal muscle that facilitates\nbreathing. Breathing requires the coordination of the lungs, the chest wall, and most importantly, the diaphragm.\nTypes of Breathing\nAmphibians have evolved multiple ways of breathing. Young amphibians, like tadpoles, use gills to breathe, and they don\u2019t leave\nthe water. Some amphibians retain gills for life. As the tadpole grows, the gills disappear and lungs grow. These lungs are\nprimitive and not as evolved as mammalian lungs. Adult amphibians are lacking or have a reduced diaphragm, so breathing via\nlungs is forced. The other means of breathing for amphibians is diffusion across the skin. To aid this diffusion, amphibian skin\nmust remain moist.\nBirds face a unique challenge with respect to breathing: They fly. Flying consumes a great amount of energy; therefore, birds\nrequire a lot of oxygen to aid their metabolic processes. Birds have evolved a respiratory system that supplies them with the\noxygen needed to enable flying. Similar to mammals, birds have lungs, which are organs specialized for gas exchange.\nOxygenated air, taken in during inhalation, diffuses across the surface of the lungs into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide\ndiffuses from the blood into the lungs and expelled during exhalation. The details of breathing between birds and mammals\ndiffer substantially.\nIn addition to lungs, birds have air sacs inside their body. Air flows in one direction from the posterior air sacs to the lungs and\nout of the anterior air sacs. The flow of air is in the opposite direction from blood flow, and gas exchange takes place much more\nefficiently. This type of breathing enables birds to obtain the requisite oxygen, even at higher altitudes where the oxygen\nconcentration is low. This directionality of airflow requires two cycles of air intake and exhalation to completely get the air out of\nthe lungs.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nAvian Respiration\nBirds have evolved a respiratory system that enables them to fly. Flying is a high-energy process and requires a lot of oxygen.\nFurthermore, many birds fly in high altitudes where the concentration of oxygen is low. How did birds evolve a respiratory\nsystem that is so unique?\nDecades of research by paleontologists have shown that birds evolved from therapods, meat-eating dinosaurs (Figure 39.14). In\nfact, fossil evidence shows that meat-eating dinosaurs that lived more than 100 million years ago had a similar flow-through\nrespiratory system with lungs and air sacs. Archaeopteryx and Xiaotingia, for example, were flying dinosaurs and are believed\nto be early precursors of birds.\n39.3 \u2022 Breathing\n1135\nFigure 39.14 Dinosaurs, from which birds descended, have similar hollow bones and are believed to have had a similar respiratory system.\n(credit b: modification of work by Zina Deretsky, National Science Foundation)\nMost of us consider that dinosaurs are extinct. However, modern birds are descendants of avian dinosaurs. The respiratory\nsystem of modern birds has been evolving for hundreds of millions of years.\nAll mammals have lungs that are the main organs for breathing. Lung capacity has evolved to support the animal\u2019s activities.\nDuring inhalation, the lungs expand with air, and oxygen diffuses across the lung\u2019s surface and enters the bloodstream. During\nexhalation, the lungs expel air and lung volume decreases. In the next few sections, the process of human breathing will be\nexplained.\nThe Mechanics of Human Breathing\nBoyle\u2019s Law is the gas law that states that in a closed space, pressure and volume are inversely related. As volume decreases,\npressure increases and vice versa (Figure 39.15). The relationship between gas pressure and volume helps to explain the\nmechanics of breathing.\nFigure 39.15 This graph shows data from Boyle\u2019s original 1662 experiment, which shows that pressure and volume are inversely related.\n1136\nChapter 39 \u2022 The Respiratory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nNo units are given as Boyle used arbitrary units in his experiments.\nThere is always a slightly negative pressure within the thoracic cavity, which aids in keeping the airways of the lungs open.\nDuring inhalation, volume increases as a result of contraction of the diaphragm, and pressure decreases (according to Boyle\u2019s\nLaw). This decrease of pressure in the thoracic cavity relative to the environment makes the cavity less than the atmosphere\n(Figure 39.16a). Because of this drop in pressure, air rushes into the respiratory passages. To increase the volume of the lungs,\nthe chest wall expands. This results from the contraction of the intercostal muscles, the muscles that are connected to the rib\ncage. Lung volume expands because the diaphragm contracts and the intercostal muscles contract, thus expanding the thoracic\ncavity. This increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity lowers pressure compared to the atmosphere, so air rushes into the\nlungs, thus increasing its volume. The resulting increase in volume is largely attributed to an increase in alveolar space, because\nthe bronchioles and bronchi are stiff structures that do not change in size.\nFigure 39.16 The lungs, chest wall, and diaphragm are all involved in respiration, both (a) inhalation and (b) expiration. (credit: modification\nof work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe chest wall expands out and away from the lungs. The lungs are elastic; therefore, when air fills the lungs, the elastic recoil\nwithin the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs. These outward and inward forces compete to\ninflate and deflate the lung with every breath. Upon exhalation, the lungs recoil to force the air out of the lungs, and the\nintercostal muscles relax, returning the chest wall back to its original position (Figure 39.16b). The diaphragm also relaxes and\nmoves higher into the thoracic cavity. This increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity relative to the environment, and air\nrushes out of the lungs. The movement of air out of the lungs is a passive event. No muscles are contracting to expel the air.\nEach lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac. The layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the visceral\npleura. A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax (Figure 39.17). The space between these layers, the\nintrapleural space, contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the\ntissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax. Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed; it is painful\nbecause the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung.\n39.3 \u2022 Breathing\n1137\nFigure 39.17 A tissue layer called pleura surrounds the lung and interior of the thoracic cavity.

On average, under non-exertion conditions, the human respiratory\nrate is 12\u201315 breaths/minute. The respiratory rate contributes to the alveolar ventilation, or how much air moves into and out of\nthe alveoli. Alveolar ventilation prevents carbon dioxide buildup in the alveoli. There are two ways to keep the alveolar ventilation\nconstant: increase the respiratory rate while decreasing the tidal volume of air per breath (shallow breathing), or decrease the\nrespiratory rate while increasing the tidal volume per breath. In either case, the ventilation remains the same, but the work done\nand type of work needed are quite different. Both tidal volume and respiratory rate are closely regulated when oxygen demand\nincreases.\nThere are two types of work conducted during respiration, flow-resistive and elastic work. Flow-resistive refers to the work of\nthe alveoli and tissues in the lung, whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal muscles, chest wall, and diaphragm.\nIncreasing the respiration rate increases the flow-resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of the muscles.\nDecreasing the respiratory rate reverses the type of work required.\nSurfactant\nThe air-tissue/water interface of the alveoli has a high surface tension. This surface tension is similar to the surface tension of\nwater at the liquid-air interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water molecules together. Surfactant is a\ncomplex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the alveoli\ntissue and the air found within the alveoli. By lowering the surface tension of the alveolar fluid, it reduces the tendency of alveoli\nto collapse.\nSurfactant works like a detergent to reduce the surface tension and allows for easier inflation of the airways. When a balloon is\nfirst inflated, it takes a large amount of effort to stretch the plastic and start to inflate the balloon. If a little bit of detergent was\napplied to the interior of the balloon, then the amount of effort or work needed to begin to inflate the balloon would decrease,\nand it would become much easier to start blowing up the balloon. This same principle applies to the airways. A small amount of\nsurfactant to the airway tissues reduces the effort or work needed to inflate those airways. Babies born prematurely sometimes\ndo not produce enough surfactant. As a result, they suffer from respiratory distress syndrome, because it requires more effort\nto inflate their lungs. Surfactant is also important for preventing collapse of small alveoli relative to large alveoli.\n1138\nChapter 39 \u2022 The Respiratory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nLung Resistance and Compliance\nPulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs. Two main causes of decreased gas exchange are\ncompliance (how elastic the lung is) and resistance (how much obstruction exists in the airways). A change in either can\ndramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.\nExamples of restrictive diseases are respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. In both diseases, the airways are\nless compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic. There is a decrease in compliance because the lung tissue cannot bend and move. In\nthese types of restrictive diseases, the intrapleural pressure is more positive and the airways collapse upon exhalation, which\ntraps air in the lungs. Forced or functional vital capacity (FVC), which is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after\ntaking the deepest breath possible, is much lower than in normal patients, and the time it takes to exhale most of the air is\ngreatly prolonged (Figure 39.18). A patient suffering from these diseases cannot exhale the normal amount of air.\nObstructive diseases and conditions include emphysema, asthma, and pulmonary edema. In emphysema, which mostly arises\nfrom smoking tobacco, the walls of the alveoli are destroyed, decreasing the surface area for gas exchange. The overall\ncompliance of the lungs is increased, because as the alveolar walls are damaged, lung elastic recoil decreases due to a loss of\nelastic fibers, and more air is trapped in the lungs at the end of exhalation. Asthma is a disease in which inflammation is\ntriggered by environmental factors. Inflammation obstructs the airways. The obstruction may be due to edema (fluid\naccumulation), smooth muscle spasms in the walls of the bronchioles, increased mucus secretion, damage to the epithelia of the\nairways, or a combination of these events. Those with asthma or edema experience increased occlusion from increased\ninflammation of the airways. This tends to block the airways, preventing the proper movement of gases (Figure 39.18). Those\nwith obstructive diseases have large volumes of air trapped after exhalation and breathe at a very high lung volume to\ncompensate for the lack of airway recruitment.\nFigure 39.18 The ratio of FEV1 (the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled in one second after taking a deep breath) to FVC (the total\namount of air that can be forcibly exhaled) can be used to diagnose whether a person has restrictive or obstructive lung disease. In\nrestrictive lung disease, FVC is reduced but airways are not obstructed, so the person is able to expel air reasonably fast. In obstructive lung\ndisease, airway obstruction results in slow exhalation as well as reduced FVC. Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio is lower in persons with obstructive\nlung disease (less than 69 percent) than in persons with restrictive disease (88 to 90 percent).\nDead Space: V/Q Mismatch\nPulmonary circulation pressure is very low compared to that of the systemic circulation. It is also independent of cardiac\noutput. This is because of a phenomenon called recruitment, which is the process of opening airways that normally remain\nclosed when cardiac output increases. As cardiac output increases, the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused\n(filled with blood) increases. These capillaries and arteries are not always in use but are ready if needed. At times, however, there\nis a mismatch between the amount of air (ventilation, V) and the amount of blood (perfusion, Q) in the lungs. This is referred to\nas ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.\nThere are two types of V/Q mismatch. Both produce dead space, regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue. Dead spaces can\n39.3 \u2022 Breathing\n1139\nseverely impact breathing, because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion. As a result, the amount of oxygen in\nthe blood decreases, whereas the carbon dioxide level increases. Dead space is created when no ventilation and/or perfusion\ntakes place. Anatomical dead space or anatomical shunt, arises from an anatomical failure, while physiological dead space or\nphysiological shunt, arises from a functional impairment of the lung or arteries.\nAn example of an anatomical shunt is the effect of gravity on the lungs. The lung is particularly susceptible to changes in the\nmagnitude and direction of gravitational forces. When someone is standing or sitting upright, the pleural pressure gradient\nleads to increased ventilation further down in the lung. As a result, the intrapleural pressure is more negative at the base of the\nlung than at the top, and more air fills the bottom of the lung than the top. Likewise, it takes less energy to pump blood to the\nbottom of the lung than to the top when in a prone position. Perfusion of the lung is not uniform while standing or sitting. This\nis a result of hydrostatic forces combined with the effect of airway pressure. An anatomical shunt develops because the\nventilation of the airways does not match the perfusion of the arteries surrounding those airways. As a result, the rate of gas\nexchange is reduced. Note that this does not occur when lying down, because in this position, gravity does not preferentially pull\nthe bottom of the lung down.\nA physiological shunt can develop if there is infection or edema in the lung that obstructs an area. This will decrease ventilation\nbut not affect perfusion; therefore, the V/Q ratio changes and gas exchange is affected.\nThe lung can compensate for these mismatches in ventilation and perfusion. If ventilation is greater than perfusion, the\narterioles dilate and the bronchioles constrict. This increases perfusion and reduces ventilation. Likewise, if ventilation is less\nthan perfusion, the arterioles constrict and the bronchioles dilate to correct the imbalance.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView the mechanics of breathing.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/breathing)\n39.4 Transport of Gases in Human Bodily Fluids\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe how oxygen is bound to hemoglobin and transported to body tissues\n\u2022\nExplain how carbon dioxide is transported from body tissues to the lungs\nOnce the oxygen diffuses across the alveoli, it enters the bloodstream and is transported to the tissues where it is unloaded, and\ncarbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli to be expelled from the body. Although gas exchange is a continuous\nprocess, the oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported by different mechanisms.\nTransport of Oxygen in the Blood\nAlthough oxygen dissolves in blood, only a small amount of oxygen is transported this way. Only 1.5 percent of oxygen in the\nblood is dissolved directly into the blood itself. Most oxygen\u201498.5 percent\u2014is bound to a protein called hemoglobin and carried\nto the tissues.\nHemoglobin\nHemoglobin, or Hb, is a protein molecule found in red blood cells (erythrocytes) made of four subunits: two alpha subunits and\ntwo beta subunits (Figure 39.19). Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen\nmolecule, allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules. Molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme\ngroups are brighter red. As a result, oxygenated arterial blood where the Hb is carrying four oxygen molecules is bright red,\nwhile venous blood that is deoxygenated is darker red.\n1140\nChapter 39 \u2022 The Respiratory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 39.19 The protein inside (a) red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells and carbon dioxide to the lungs is (b) hemoglobin.\nHemoglobin is made up of four symmetrical subunits and four heme groups. Iron associated with the heme binds oxygen. It is the iron in\nhemoglobin that gives blood its red color.\nIt is easier to bind a second and third oxygen molecule to Hb than the first molecule. This is because the hemoglobin molecule\nchanges its shape, or conformation, as oxygen binds. The fourth oxygen is then more difficult to bind. The binding of oxygen to\nhemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (x-axis) versus the relative Hb-oxygen\nsaturation (y-axis). The resulting graph\u2014an oxygen dissociation curve\u2014is sigmoidal, or S-shaped (Figure 39.20). As the partial\npressure of oxygen increases, the hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 39.20 The oxygen dissociation curve demonstrates that, as the partial pressure of oxygen increases, more oxygen binds hemoglobin.\nHowever, the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen may shift to the left or the right depending on environmental conditions.\nThe kidneys are responsible for removing excess H+ ions from the blood. If the kidneys fail, what would happen to blood pH and\nto hemoglobin affinity for oxygen?\nFactors That Affect Oxygen Binding\nThe oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood. In addition to\n, other\nenvironmental factors and diseases can affect oxygen carrying capacity and delivery.\nCarbon dioxide levels, blood pH, and body temperature affect oxygen-carrying capacity (Figure 39.20). When carbon dioxide is\n39.4 \u2022 Transport of Gases in Human Bodily Fluids\n1141\nin the blood, it reacts with water to form bicarbonate\nand hydrogen ions (H+). As the level of carbon dioxide in the\nblood increases, more H+ is produced and the pH decreases. This increase in carbon dioxide and subsequent decrease in pH\nreduce the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The oxygen dissociates from the Hb molecule, shifting the oxygen dissociation\ncurve to the right. Therefore, more oxygen is needed to reach the same hemoglobin saturation level as when the pH was higher.\nA similar shift in the curve also results from an increase in body temperature. Increased temperature, such as from increased\nactivity of skeletal muscle, causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced.\nDiseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood\u2019s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen-carrying\ncapacity. In sickle cell anemia, the shape of the red blood cell is crescent-shaped, elongated, and stiffened, reducing its ability to\ndeliver oxygen (Figure 39.21). In this form, red blood cells cannot pass through the capillaries. This is painful when it occurs.\nThalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit of Hb. Patients with thalassemia\nproduce a high number of red blood cells, but these cells have lower-than-normal levels of hemoglobin. Therefore, the oxygen-\ncarrying capacity is diminished.\nFigure 39.21 Individuals with sickle cell anemia have crescent-shaped red blood cells. (credit: modification of work by Ed Uthman; scale-\nbar data from Matt Russell)\nTransport of Carbon Dioxide in the Blood\nCarbon dioxide molecules are transported in the blood from body tissues to the lungs by one of three methods: dissolution\ndirectly into the blood, binding to hemoglobin, or carried as a bicarbonate ion. Several properties of carbon dioxide in the blood\naffect its transport. First, carbon dioxide is more soluble in blood than oxygen. About 5 to 7 percent of all carbon dioxide is\ndissolved in the plasma. Second, carbon dioxide can bind to plasma proteins or can enter red blood cells and bind to\nhemoglobin. This form transports about 10 percent of the carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin, a\nmolecule called carbaminohemoglobin is formed. Binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin is reversible. Therefore, when it\nreaches the lungs, the carbon dioxide can freely dissociate from the hemoglobin and be expelled from the body.\nThird, the majority of carbon dioxide molecules (85 percent) are carried as part of the bicarbonate buffer system. In this system,\ncarbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) within the red blood cells quickly converts the carbon\ndioxide into carbonic acid (H2CO3). Carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate molecule that immediately dissociates into\nbicarbonate ions\nand hydrogen (H+) ions. Since carbon dioxide is quickly converted into bicarbonate ions, this\nreaction allows for the continued uptake of carbon dioxide into the blood down its concentration gradient. It also results in the\nproduction of H+ ions. If too much H+ is produced, it can alter blood pH. However, hemoglobin binds to the free H+ ions and\nthus limits shifts in pH. The newly synthesized bicarbonate ion is transported out of the red blood cell into the liquid component\nof the blood in exchange for a chloride ion (Cl-); this is called the chloride shift. When the blood reaches the lungs, the\nbicarbonate ion is transported back into the red blood cell in exchange for the chloride ion. The H+ ion dissociates from the\nhemoglobin and binds to the bicarbonate ion. This produces the carbonic acid intermediate, which is converted back into\ncarbon dioxide through the enzymatic action of CA. The carbon dioxide produced is expelled through the lungs during\nexhalation.\n1142\nChapter 39 \u2022 The Respiratory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe benefit of the bicarbonate buffer system is that carbon dioxide is \u201csoaked up\u201d into the blood with little change to the pH of\nthe system. This is important because it takes only a small change in the overall pH of the body for severe injury or death to\nresult. The presence of this bicarbonate buffer system also allows for people to travel and live at high altitudes: When the partial\npressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide change at high altitudes, the bicarbonate buffer system adjusts to regulate carbon\ndioxide while maintaining the correct pH in the body.\nCarbon Monoxide Poisoning\nWhile carbon dioxide can readily associate and dissociate from hemoglobin, other molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO)\ncannot. Carbon monoxide has a greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. Therefore, when carbon monoxide is present, it\nbinds to hemoglobin preferentially over oxygen. As a result, oxygen cannot bind to hemoglobin, so very little oxygen is\ntransported through the body (Figure 39.22). Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas and is therefore difficult to detect. It\nis produced by gas-powered vehicles and tools. Carbon monoxide can cause headaches, confusion, and nausea; long-term\nexposure can cause brain damage or death. Administering 100 percent (pure) oxygen is the usual treatment for carbon\nmonoxide poisoning. Administration of pure oxygen speeds up the separation of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin.\nFigure 39.22 As percent CO increases, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin decreases.\n39.4 \u2022 Transport of Gases in Human Bodily Fluids\n1143\n", "key_terms": "\nalveolar\npartial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli\n(usually around 100 mmHg)\nalveolar duct\nduct that extends from the terminal\nbronchiole to the alveolar sac\nalveolar sac\nstructure consisting of two or more alveoli that\nshare a common opening\nalveolar ventilation\nhow much air is in the alveoli\nalveolus\n(plural: alveoli) (also, air sac) terminal region of the\nlung where gas exchange occurs\nanatomical dead space\n(also, anatomical shunt) region of\nthe lung that lacks proper ventilation/perfusion due to an\nanatomical block\nbicarbonate\nion\nion created when carbonic acid\ndissociates into H+ and\nbicarbonate buffer system\nsystem in the blood that absorbs\ncarbon dioxide and regulates pH levels\nbronchiole\nairway that extends from the main tertiary\nbronchi to the alveolar sac\nbronchus\n(plural: bronchi) smaller branch of cartilaginous\ntissue that stems off of the trachea;

In mammals, air is warmed and humidified in the\nnasal cavity. Air then travels down the pharynx, through the\ntrachea, and into the lungs. In the lungs, air passes through\nthe branching bronchi, reaching the respiratory bronchioles,\nwhich house the first site of gas exchange. The respiratory\nbronchioles open into the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and\nalveoli. Because there are so many alveoli and alveolar sacs in\nthe lung, the surface area for gas exchange is very large.\nSeveral protective mechanisms are in place to prevent\ndamage or infection. These include the hair and mucus in\nthe nasal cavity that trap dust, dirt, and other particulate\nmatter before they can enter the system. In the lungs,\nparticles are trapped in a mucus layer and transported via\ncilia up to the esophageal opening at the top of the trachea to\nbe swallowed.\n39.2 Gas Exchange across\nRespiratory Surfaces\nThe lungs can hold a large volume of air, but they are not\nusually filled to maximal capacity. Lung volume\nmeasurements include tidal volume, expiratory reserve\nvolume, inspiratory reserve volume, and residual volume.\nThe sum of these equals the total lung capacity. Gas\nmovement into or out of the lungs is dependent on the\npressure of the gas. Air is a mixture of gases; therefore, the\npartial pressure of each gas can be calculated to determine\nhow the gas will flow in the lung. The difference between the\npartial pressure of the gas in the air drives oxygen into the\ntissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.\n39.3 Breathing\nThe structure of the lungs and thoracic cavity control the\nmechanics of breathing. Upon inspiration, the diaphragm\ncontracts and lowers. The intercostal muscles contract and\nexpand the chest wall outward. The intrapleural pressure\ndrops, the lungs expand, and air is drawn into the airways.\nWhen exhaling, the intercostal muscles and diaphragm\nrelax, returning the intrapleural pressure back to the resting\nstate. The lungs recoil and airways close. The air passively\nexits the lung. There is high surface tension at the air-airway\ninterface in the lung. Surfactant, a mixture of phospholipids\nand lipoproteins, acts like a detergent in the airways to\nreduce surface tension and allow for opening of the alveoli.\nBreathing and gas exchange are both altered by changes in\nthe compliance and resistance of the lung. If the compliance\nof the lung decreases, as occurs in restrictive diseases like\nfibrosis, the airways stiffen and collapse upon exhalation. Air\nbecomes trapped in the lungs, making breathing more\ndifficult. If resistance increases, as happens with asthma or\nemphysema, the airways become obstructed, trapping air in\nthe lungs and causing breathing to become difficult.\nAlterations in the ventilation of the airways or perfusion of\nthe arteries can affect gas exchange. These changes in\nventilation and perfusion, called V/Q mismatch, can arise\nfrom anatomical or physiological changes.\nChapter 39 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n1145\n39.4 Transport of Gases in Human\nBodily Fluids\nHemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that is\ncomprised of two alpha and two beta subunits that surround\nan iron-containing heme group. Oxygen readily binds this\nheme group. The ability of oxygen to bind increases as more\noxygen molecules are bound to heme. Disease states and\naltered conditions in the body can affect the binding ability\nof oxygen, and increase or decrease its ability to dissociate\nfrom hemoglobin.\nCarbon dioxide can be transported through the blood via\nthree methods. It is dissolved directly in the blood, bound to\nplasma proteins or hemoglobin, or converted into\nbicarbonate. The majority of carbon dioxide is transported as\npart of the bicarbonate system. Carbon dioxide diffuses into\nred blood cells. Inside, carbonic anhydrase converts carbon\ndioxide into carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is subsequently\nhydrolyzed into bicarbonate\nand H+. The H+ ion\nbinds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, and bicarbonate is\ntransported out of the red blood cells in exchange for a\nchloride ion. This is called the chloride shift. Bicarbonate\nleaves the red blood cells and enters the blood plasma. In the\nlungs, bicarbonate is transported back into the red blood\ncells in exchange for chloride. The H+ dissociates from\nhemoglobin and combines with bicarbonate to form\ncarbonic acid with the help of carbonic anhydrase, which\nfurther catalyzes the reaction to convert carbonic acid back\ninto carbon dioxide and water.

(credit:\nmodification of work by Andrey Belenko)\nINTRODUCTION Most animals are complex multicellular organisms that require a mechanism for\ntransporting nutrients throughout their bodies and removing waste products. The circulatory system\nhas evolved over time from simple diffusion through cells in the early evolution of animals to a complex\nnetwork of blood vessels that reach all parts of the human body. This extensive network supplies the cells,\ntissues, and organs with oxygen and nutrients, and removes carbon dioxide and waste, which are\nbyproducts of respiration.\nAt the core of the human circulatory system is the heart. The size of a clenched fist, the human heart is\nprotected beneath the rib cage. Made of specialized and unique cardiac muscle, it pumps blood\nthroughout the body and to the heart itself. Heart contractions are driven by intrinsic electrical impulses\nthat the brain and endocrine hormones help to regulate. Understanding the heart\u2019s basic anatomy and\nfunction is important to understanding the body\u2019s circulatory and respiratory systems.\nGas exchange is one essential function of the circulatory system. A circulatory system is not needed in\norganisms with no specialized respiratory organs because oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse directly\nbetween their body tissues and the external environment. However, in organisms that possess lungs and\ngills, oxygen must be transported from these specialized respiratory organs to the body tissues via a\ncirculatory system. Therefore, circulatory systems have had to evolve to accommodate the great diversity\nof body sizes and body types present among animals.\nChapter Outline\n40.1 Overview of the\nCirculatory System\n40.2 Components of the\nBlood\n40.3 Mammalian Heart\nand Blood Vessels\n40.4 Blood Flow and\nBlood Pressure\nRegulation\nanimals that are only a few cell layers thick; however, bulk flow is the only method by which the entire body\nof larger more complex organisms is accessed.\nCirculatory System Architecture\nThe circulatory system is effectively a network of cylindrical vessels: the arteries, veins, and capillaries that\nemanate from a pump, the heart. In all vertebrate organisms, as well as some invertebrates, this is a closed-\nloop system, in which the blood is not free in a cavity. In a closed circulatory system, blood is contained\ninside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around the systemic circulatory route,\nthen returns to the heart again, as illustrated in Figure 40.2a. As opposed to a closed system,\narthropods\u2014including insects, crustaceans, and most mollusks\u2014have an open circulatory system, as\nillustrated in Figure 40.2b. In an open circulatory system, the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but\nis pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the\ninterstitial fluid. As the heart beats and the animal moves, the hemolymph circulates around the organs\nwithin the body cavity and then reenters the hearts through openings called ostia. This movement allows for\ngas and nutrient exchange. An open circulatory system does not use as much energy as a closed system to\noperate or to maintain; however, there is a trade-off with the amount of blood that can be moved to\nmetabolically active organs and tissues that require high levels of oxygen. In fact, one reason that insects\nwith wing spans of up to two feet wide (70 cm) are not around today is probably because they were\noutcompeted by the arrival of birds 150 million years ago. Birds, having a closed circulatory system, are\nthought to have moved more agilely, allowing them to get food faster and possibly to prey on the insects.\nFigure 40.2 In (a) closed circulatory systems, the heart pumps blood through vessels that are separate from the\ninterstitial fluid of the body. Most vertebrates and some invertebrates, like this annelid earthworm, have a closed\ncirculatory system. In (b) open circulatory systems, a fluid called hemolymph is pumped through a blood vessel that\nempties into the body cavity. Hemolymph returns to the blood vessel through openings called ostia. Arthropods like\nthis bee and most mollusks have open circulatory systems.\nCirculatory System Variation in Animals\nThe circulatory system varies from simple systems in invertebrates to more complex systems in vertebrates.\nThe simplest animals, such as the sponges (Porifera) and rotifers (Rotifera), do not need a circulatory system\nbecause diffusion allows adequate exchange of water, nutrients, and waste, as well as dissolved gases, as\nshown in Figure 40.3a. Organisms that are more complex but still only have two layers of cells in their body\nplan, such as jellies (Cnidaria) and comb jellies (Ctenophora) also use diffusion through their epidermis and\ninternally through the gastrovascular compartment. Both their internal and external tissues are bathed in an\naqueous environment and exchange fluids by diffusion on both sides, as illustrated in Figure 40.3b.\nExchange of fluids is assisted by the pulsing of the jellyfish body.\n1150\nChapter 40 \u2022 The Circulatory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 40.3 Simple animals consisting of a single cell layer such as the (a) sponge or only a few cell layers such as the (b) jellyfish do not\nhave a circulatory system. Instead, gases, nutrients, and wastes are exchanged by diffusion.\nFor more complex organisms, diffusion is not efficient for cycling gases, nutrients, and waste effectively through the body;\ntherefore, more complex circulatory systems evolved. Most arthropods and many mollusks have open circulatory systems. In an\nopen system, an elongated beating heart pushes the hemolymph through the body and muscle contractions help to move fluids.\nThe larger more complex crustaceans, including lobsters, have developed arterial-like vessels to push blood through their\nbodies, and the most active mollusks, such as squids, have evolved a closed circulatory system and are able to move rapidly to\ncatch prey. Closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are significant differences in the\nstructure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptation during evolution\nand associated differences in anatomy. Figure 40.4 illustrates the basic circulatory systems of some vertebrates: fish,\namphibians, reptiles, and mammals.\n40.1 \u2022 Overview of the Circulatory System\n1151\nFigure 40.4 (a) Fish have the simplest circulatory systems of the vertebrates: blood flows unidirectionally from the two-chambered heart\nthrough the gills and then the rest of the body. (b) Amphibians have two circulatory routes: one for oxygenation of the blood through the\nlungs and skin, and the other to take oxygen to the rest of the body. The blood is pumped from a three-chambered heart with two atria and\na single ventricle. (c) Reptiles also have two circulatory routes; however, blood is only oxygenated through the lungs. The heart is three\nchambered, but the ventricles are partially separated so some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood occurs except in crocodilians\nand birds. (d) Mammals and birds have the most efficient heart with four chambers that completely separate the oxygenated and\ndeoxygenated blood; it pumps only oxygenated blood through the body and deoxygenated blood to the lungs.\nAs illustrated in Figure 40.4a. Fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a two-chambered heart that has only a single atrium\nand a single ventricle. The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills\nwhere gas exchange occurs and the blood is re-oxygenated; this is called gill circulation. The blood then continues through the\nrest of the body before arriving back at the atrium; this is called systemic circulation. This unidirectional flow of blood produces\na gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fish\u2019s systemic circuit. The result is a limit in the amount of oxygen\nthat can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body, reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish.\n1152\nChapter 40 \u2022 The Circulatory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nIn amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart,\nwhich is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain\n(systemic circulation). In amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred\nto as pulmocutaneous circulation.\nAs shown in Figure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-\nchambered heart of fish. The two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the\nsystems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart\u2019s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the\nefficiency of oxygenation. The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and\nbody. The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory\nsystem and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. For this reason, amphibians are often described as having\ndouble circulation.\nMost reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and\nsystemic circuits, as shown in Figure 40.4c. The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less\nmixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to\nexhibit a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs\ntoward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays\nunderwater waiting for prey to rot. One adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes\nblood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. Two other adaptations\ninclude a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of Panizza, which allows blood to move from one side\nof the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. Together these adaptations\nhave made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth.\nIn mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in Figure 40.4d.\nThe oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is\nprobably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. The four-chambered heart of birds and mammals\nevolved independently from a three-chambered heart. The independent evolution of the same or a similar biological trait is\nreferred to as convergent evolution.\n40.2 Components of the Blood\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nList the basic components of the blood\n\u2022\nCompare red and white blood cells\n\u2022\nDescribe blood plasma and serum\nHemoglobin is responsible for distributing oxygen, and to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide, throughout the circulatory systems of\nhumans, vertebrates, and many invertebrates. The blood is more than the proteins, though. Blood is actually a term used to\ndescribe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma (the liquid portion, which contains water, proteins, salts,\nlipids, and glucose) and the cells (red and white cells) and cell fragments called platelets. Blood plasma is actually the dominant\ncomponent of blood and contains the water, proteins, electrolytes, lipids, and glucose. The cells are responsible for carrying the\ngases (red cells) and the immune response (white). The platelets are responsible for blood clotting. Interstitial fluid that\nsurrounds cells is separate from the blood, but in hemolymph, they are combined. In humans, cellular components make up\napproximately 45 percent of the blood and the liquid plasma 55 percent. Blood is 20 percent of a person\u2019s extracellular fluid and\neight percent of weight.\nThe Role of Blood in the Body\nBlood, like the human blood illustrated in Figure 40.5 is important for regulation of the body\u2019s systems and homeostasis. Blood\nhelps maintain homeostasis by stabilizing pH, temperature, osmotic pressure, and by eliminating excess heat. Blood supports\ngrowth by distributing nutrients and hormones, and by removing waste. Blood plays a protective role by transporting clotting\nfactors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease-fighting agents or white blood cells to sites of infection.\n40.2 \u2022 Components of the Blood\n1153\nFigure 40.5 The cells and cellular components of human blood are shown. Red blood cells deliver oxygen to the cells and remove carbon\ndioxide. White blood cells\u2014including neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils\u2014are involved in the immune\nresponse. Platelets form clots that prevent blood loss after injury.\nRed Blood Cells\nRed blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythro- = \u201cred\u201d; -cyte = \u201ccell\u201d), are specialized cells that circulate through the body delivering\noxygen to cells; they are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow. In mammals, red blood cells are small biconcave cells that\nat maturity do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria and are only 7\u20138 \u00b5m in size. In birds and non-avian reptiles, a nucleus is\nstill maintained in red blood cells.\nThe red coloring of blood comes from the iron-containing protein hemoglobin, illustrated in Figure 40.6a. The principle job of\nthis protein is to carry oxygen, but it also transports carbon dioxide as well. Hemoglobin is packed into red blood cells at a rate\nof about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin per cell. Each hemoglobin molecule binds four oxygen molecules so that each red\nblood cell carries one billion molecules of oxygen. There are approximately 25 trillion red blood cells in the five liters of blood in\nthe human body, which could carry up to 25 sextillion (25 \u00d7 1021) molecules of oxygen in the body at any time. In mammals, the\nlack of organelles in erythrocytes leaves more room for the hemoglobin molecules, and the lack of mitochondria also prevents\nuse of the oxygen for metabolic respiration. Only mammals have anucleated red blood cells, and some mammals (camels, for\ninstance) even have nucleated red blood cells. The advantage of nucleated red blood cells is that these cells can undergo mitosis.\nAnucleated red blood cells metabolize anaerobically (without oxygen), making use of a primitive metabolic pathway to produce\nATP and increase the efficiency of oxygen transport.\nNot all organisms use hemoglobin as the method of oxygen transport. Invertebrates that utilize hemolymph rather than blood\nuse different pigments to bind to the oxygen. These pigments use copper or iron to the oxygen. Invertebrates have a variety of\nother respiratory pigments. Hemocyanin, a blue-green, copper-containing protein, illustrated in Figure 40.6b is found in\nmollusks, crustaceans, and some of the arthropods. Chlorocruorin, a green-colored, iron-containing pigment is found in four\nfamilies of polychaete tubeworms. Hemerythrin, a red, iron-containing protein is found in some polychaete worms and\nannelids and is illustrated in Figure 40.6c. Despite the name, hemerythrin does not contain a heme group and its oxygen-\ncarrying capacity is poor compared to hemoglobin.\n1154\nChapter 40 \u2022 The Circulatory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 40.6 In most vertebrates, (a) hemoglobin delivers oxygen to the body and removes some carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin is composed\nof four protein subunits, two alpha chains and two beta chains, and a heme group that has iron associated with it. The iron reversibly\nassociates with oxygen, and in so doing is oxidized from Fe2+ to Fe3+. In most mollusks and some arthropods, (b) hemocyanin delivers\noxygen. Unlike hemoglobin, hemolymph is not carried in blood cells, but floats free in the hemolymph. Copper instead of iron binds the\noxygen, giving the hemolymph a blue-green color. In annelids, such as the earthworm, and some other invertebrates, (c) hemerythrin\ncarries oxygen. Like hemoglobin, hemerythrin is carried in blood cells and has iron associated with it, but despite its name, hemerythrin\ndoes not contain heme.\nThe small size and large surface area of red blood cells allows for rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the plasma\nmembrane. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is taken in by the blood. In the tissues, oxygen is released from\nthe blood and carbon dioxide is bound for transport back to the lungs. Studies have found that hemoglobin also binds nitrous\noxide (NO). NO is a vasodilator that relaxes the blood vessels and capillaries and may help with gas exchange and the passage of\nred blood cells through narrow vessels. Nitroglycerin, a heart medication for angina and heart attacks, is converted to NO to\nhelp relax the blood vessels and increase oxygen flow through the body.\nA characteristic of red blood cells is their glycolipid and glycoprotein coating; these are lipids and proteins that have\ncarbohydrate molecules attached. In humans, the surface glycoproteins and glycolipids on red blood cells vary between\nindividuals, producing the different blood types, such as A, B, and O. Red blood cells have an average life span of 120 days, at\nwhich time they are broken down and recycled in the liver and spleen by phagocytic macrophages, a type of white blood cell.\nWhite Blood Cells\nWhite blood cells, also called leukocytes (leuko = white), make up approximately one percent by volume of the cells in blood. The\nrole of white blood cells is very different than that of red blood cells: they are primarily involved in the immune response to\nidentify and target pathogens, such as invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms. White blood cells are formed\ncontinually; some only live for hours or days, but some live for years.\nThe morphology of white blood cells differs significantly from red blood cells. They have nuclei and do not contain hemoglobin.\nThe different types of white blood cells are identified by their microscopic appearance after histologic staining, and each has a\ndifferent specialized function. The two main groups, both illustrated in Figure 40.7 are the granulocytes, which include the\nneutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, and the agranulocytes, which include the monocytes and lymphocytes.\n40.2 \u2022 Components of the Blood\n1155\nFigure 40.7 (a) Granulocytes\u2014including neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils\u2014are characterized by a lobed nucleus and granular\ninclusions in the cytoplasm. Granulocytes are typically first-responders during injury or infection. (b) Agranulocytes include lymphocytes\nand monocytes. Lymphocytes, including B and T cells, are responsible for adaptive immune response. Monocytes differentiate into\nmacrophages and dendritic cells, which in turn respond to infection or injury.\nGranulocytes contain granules in their cytoplasm; the agranulocytes are so named because of the lack of granules in their\ncytoplasm. Some leukocytes become macrophages that either stay at the same site or move through the bloodstream and gather\nat sites of infection or inflammation where they are attracted by chemical signals from foreign particles and damaged cells.\nLymphocytes are the primary cells of the immune system and include B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells. B cells destroy\nbacteria and inactivate their toxins. They also produce antibodies. T cells attack viruses, fungi, some bacteria, transplanted cells,\nand cancer cells. T cells attack viruses by releasing toxins that kill the viruses. Natural killer cells attack a variety of infectious\nmicrobes and certain tumor cells.\nOne reason that HIV poses significant management challenges is because the virus directly targets T cells by gaining entry\nthrough a receptor. Once inside the cell, HIV then multiplies using the T cell\u2019s own genetic machinery. After the HIV virus\nreplicates, it is transmitted directly from the infected T cell to macrophages. The presence of HIV can remain unrecognized for\nan extensive period of time before full disease symptoms develop.\nPlatelets and Coagulation Factors\nBlood must clot to heal wounds and prevent excess blood loss. Small cell fragments called platelets (thrombocytes) are attracted\nto the wound site where they adhere by extending many projections and releasing their contents. These contents activate other\nplatelets and also interact with other coagulation factors, which convert fibrinogen, a water-soluble protein present in blood\nserum into fibrin (a non-water soluble protein), causing the blood to clot. Many of the clotting factors require vitamin K to work,\nand vitamin K deficiency can lead to problems with blood clotting. Many platelets converge and stick together at the wound site\nforming a platelet plug (also called a fibrin clot), as illustrated in Figure 40.8b. The plug or clot lasts for a number of days and\nstops the loss of blood. Platelets are formed from the disintegration of larger cells called megakaryocytes, like that shown in\nFigure 40.8a. For each megakaryocyte, 2000\u20133000 platelets are formed with 150,000 to 400,000 platelets present in each cubic\nmillimeter of blood. Each platelet is disc shaped and 2\u20134 \u03bcm in diameter. They contain many small vesicles but do not contain a\nnucleus.\n1156\nChapter 40 \u2022 The Circulatory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 40.8 (a) Platelets are formed from large cells called megakaryocytes. The megakaryocyte breaks up into thousands of fragments\nthat become platelets. (b) Platelets are required for clotting of the blood. The platelets collect at a wound site in conjunction with other\nclotting factors, such as fibrinogen, to form a fibrin clot that prevents blood loss and allows the wound to heal.\nPlasma and Serum\nThe liquid component of blood is called plasma, and it is separated by spinning or centrifuging the blood at high rotations (3000\nrpm or higher). The blood cells and platelets are separated by centrifugal forces to the bottom of a specimen tube. The upper\nliquid layer, the plasma, consists of 90 percent water along with various substances required for maintaining the body\u2019s pH,\nosmotic load, and for protecting the body. The plasma also contains the coagulation factors and antibodies.\nThe plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called the serum. Serum is similar to interstitial fluid in\nwhich the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves. Other\ncomponents in the serum include proteins that assist with maintaining pH and osmotic balance while giving viscosity to the\nblood. The serum also contains antibodies, specialized proteins that are important for defense against viruses and bacteria.\nLipids, including cholesterol, are also transported in the serum, along with various other substances including nutrients,\nhormones, metabolic waste, plus external substances, such as, drugs, viruses, and bacteria.\nHuman serum albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma and is synthesized in the liver. Albumin, which\nconstitutes about half of the blood serum protein, transports hormones and fatty acids, buffers pH, and maintains osmotic\npressures. Immunoglobin is a protein antibody produced in the mucosal lining and plays an important role in antibody\nmediated immunity.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nBlood Types Related to Proteins on the Surface of the Red Blood Cells\nRed blood cells are coated in antigens made of glycolipids and glycoproteins. The composition of these molecules is determined\nby genetics, which have evolved over time. In humans, the different surface antigens are grouped into 24 different blood groups\nwith more than 100 different antigens on each red blood cell. The two most well known blood groups are the ABO, shown in\nFigure 40.9, and Rh systems. The surface antigens in the ABO blood group are glycolipids, called antigen A and antigen B. People\nwith blood type A have antigen A, those with blood type B have antigen B, those with blood type AB have both antigens, and\npeople with blood type O have neither antigen. Antibodies called agglutinougens are found in the blood plasma and react with\nthe A or B antigens, if the two are mixed. When type A and type B blood are combined, agglutination (clumping) of the blood\noccurs because of antibodies in the plasma that bind with the opposing antigen; this causes clots that coagulate in the kidney\ncausing kidney failure. Type O blood has neither A or B antigens, and therefore, type O blood can be given to all blood types.\n40.2 \u2022 Components of the Blood\n1157\nType O negative blood is the universal donor. Type AB positive blood is the universal acceptor because it has both A and B\nantigen. The ABO blood groups were discovered in 1900 and 1901 by Karl Landsteiner at the University of Vienna.\nThe Rh blood group was first discovered in Rhesus monkeys. Most people have the Rh antigen (Rh+) and do not have anti-Rh\nantibodies in their blood. The few people who do not have the Rh antigen and are Rh\u2013 can develop anti-Rh antibodies if exposed\nto Rh+ blood. This can happen after a blood transfusion or after an Rh\u2013 woman has an Rh+ baby. The first exposure does not\nusually cause a reaction; however, at the second exposure, enough antibodies have built up in the blood to produce a reaction\nthat causes agglutination and breakdown of red blood cells. An injection can prevent this reaction.\nFigure 40.9 Human red blood cells may have either type A or B glycoproteins on their surface, both glycoproteins combined (AB), or neither\n(O). The glycoproteins serve as antigens and can elicit an immune response in a person who receives a transfusion containing unfamiliar\nantigens. Type O blood, which has no A or B antigens, does not elicit an immune response when injected into a person of any blood type.\nThus, O is considered the universal donor. Persons with type AB blood can accept blood from any blood type, and type AB is considered the\nuniversal acceptor.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPlay a blood typing game on the Nobel Prize website (http://openstax.org/l/blood_typing) to solidify your understanding of\nblood types.\n40.3 Mammalian Heart and Blood Vessels\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the structure of the heart and explain how cardiac muscle is different from other muscles\n\u2022\nDescribe the cardiac cycle\n\u2022\nExplain the structure of arteries, veins, and capillaries, and how blood flows through the body\nThe heart is a complex muscle that pumps blood through the three divisions of the circulatory system: the coronary (vessels that\nserve the heart), pulmonary (heart and lungs), and systemic (systems of the body), as shown in Figure 40.10. Coronary\ncirculation intrinsic to the heart takes blood directly from the main artery (aorta) coming from the heart. For pulmonary and\nsystemic circulation, the heart has to pump blood to the lungs or the rest of the body, respectively. In vertebrates, the lungs are\nrelatively close to the heart in the thoracic cavity. The shorter distance to pump means that the muscle wall on the right side of\nthe heart is not as thick as the left side which must have enough pressure to pump blood all the way to your big toe.\n1158\nChapter 40 \u2022 The Circulatory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 40.10 The mammalian circulatory system is divided into three circuits: the systemic circuit, the pulmonary circuit, and the coronary\ncircuit. Blood is pumped from veins of the systemic circuit into the right atrium of the heart, then into the right ventricle. Blood then enters\nthe pulmonary circuit, and is oxygenated by the lungs. From the pulmonary circuit, blood reenters the heart through the left atrium. From\nthe left ventricle, blood reenters the systemic circuit through the aorta and is distributed to the rest of the body. The coronary circuit, which\nprovides blood to the heart, is not shown.\nWhich of the following statements about the circulatory system is false?\na.\nBlood in the pulmonary vein is deoxygenated.\nb.\nBlood in the inferior vena cava is deoxygenated.\nc.\nBlood in the pulmonary artery is deoxygenated.\nd.\nBlood in the aorta is oxygenated.\nStructure of the Heart\nThe heart muscle is asymmetrical as a result of the distance blood must travel in the pulmonary and systemic circuits. Since the\nright side of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which must send blood out to the\nwhole body in the systemic circuit, as shown in Figure 40.11. In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is\ndivided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium\nand one ventricle on the left side. The atria are the chambers that receive blood, and the ventricles are the chambers that pump\nblood. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava, which drains blood from the jugular vein that\ncomes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as from the inferior vena cava which drains blood\nfrom the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. In addition, the right atrium receives blood from the coronary\nsinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through\nthe atrioventricular valve or the tricuspid valve, a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one direction to prevent the\nbackflow of blood. The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve.\nAfter it is filled, the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries, bypassing the semilunar valve (or\npulmonic valve) to the lungs for re-oxygenation. After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries, the right semilunar valves\nclose preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle. The left atrium then receives the oxygen-rich blood\nfrom the lungs via the pulmonary veins. This blood passes through the bicuspid valve or mitral valve (the atrioventricular valve\non the left side of the heart) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through the aorta, the major artery of the body,\ntaking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the\naorta, the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic valve) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle. This\npattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals.\n40.3 \u2022 Mammalian Heart and Blood Vessels\n1159\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 40.11 (a) The heart is primarily made of a thick muscle layer, called the myocardium, surrounded by membranes. One-way valves\nseparate the four chambers. (b) Blood vessels of the coronary system, including the coronary arteries and veins, keep the heart\nmusculature oxygenated.\nWhich of the following statements about the heart is false?\na.\nThe mitral valve separates the left ventricle from the left atrium.\nb.\nBlood travels through the bicuspid valve to the left atrium.\nc.\nBoth the aortic and the pulmonary valves are semilunar valves.\nd.\nThe mitral valve is an atrioventricular valve.\nThe heart is composed of three layers; the epicardium, the myocardium, and the endocardium, illustrated in Figure 40.11. The\n1160\nChapter 40 \u2022 The Circulatory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ninner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium. The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the\nmiddle layer and the bulk of the heart wall. The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium, of which the second layer is a\nmembranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart; it allows enough room for\nvigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures.\nThe heart has its own blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood. The coronary arteries branch from the aorta and\nsurround the outer surface of the heart like a crown. They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with\noxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood\nwill be re-oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit. The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood.\nAtherosclerosis is the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques. Because of the size (narrow) of the coronary arteries\nand their function in serving the heart itself, atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries. The slowdown of blood flow and\nsubsequent oxygen deprivation that results from atherosclerosis causes severe pain, known as angina, and complete blockage of\nthe arteries will cause myocardial infarction: the death of cardiac muscle tissue, commonly known as a heart attack.\nThe Cardiac Cycle\nThe main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle. The\ncardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart\nmuscles to contract and relax. The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day. In each cardiac cycle, the heart contracts\n(systole), pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body; this is followed by a relaxation phase (diastole), where the\nheart fills with blood, as illustrated in Figure 40.12. The atria contract at the same time, forcing blood through the\natrioventricular valves into the ventricles. Closing of the atrioventricular valves produces a monosyllabic \u201clup\u201d sound. Following\na brief delay, the ventricles contract at the same time forcing blood through the semilunar valves into the aorta and the artery\ntransporting blood to the lungs (via the pulmonary artery). Closing of the semilunar valves produces a monosyllabic \u201cdup\u201d\nsound.\nFigure 40.12 During (a) cardiac diastole, the heart muscle is relaxed and blood flows into the heart. During (b) atrial systole, the atria\ncontract, pushing blood into the ventricles. During (c) atrial diastole, the ventricles contract, forcing blood out of the heart.\nThe pumping of the heart is a function of the cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, that make up the heart muscle.\nCardiomyocytes, shown in Figure 40.13, are distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically\nand involuntarily like smooth muscle; they are connected by intercalated disks exclusive to cardiac muscle. They are self-\nstimulated for a period of time and isolated cardiomyocytes will beat if given the correct balance of nutrients and electrolytes.\n40.3 \u2022 Mammalian Heart and Blood Vessels\n1161\nFigure 40.13 Cardiomyocytes are striated muscle cells found in cardiac tissue. (credit: modification of work by Dr. S. Girod, Anton Becker;\nscale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe autonomous beating of cardiac muscle cells is regulated by the heart\u2019s internal pacemaker that uses electrical signals to time\nthe beating of the heart. The electrical signals and mechanical actions, illustrated in Figure 40.14, are intimately intertwined.\nThe internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is located near the wall of the right atrium. Electrical charges\nspontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison. The pulse reaches a second node, called the\natrioventricular (AV) node, between the right atrium and right ventricle where it pauses for approximately 0.1 second before\nspreading to the walls of the ventricles. From the AV node, the electrical impulse enters the bundle of His, then to the left and\nright bundle branches extending through the interventricular septum. Finally, the Purkinje fibers conduct the impulse from the\napex of the heart up the ventricular myocardium, and then the ventricles contract. This pause allows the atria to empty\ncompletely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood. The electrical impulses in the heart produce electrical\ncurrents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using electrodes. This information can be observed as an\nelectrocardiogram (ECG)\u2014a recording of the electrical impulses of the cardiac muscle.\n1162\nChapter 40 \u2022 The Circulatory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 40.14 The beating of the heart is regulated by an electrical impulse that causes the characteristic reading of an ECG. The signal is\ninitiated at the sinoatrial valve. The signal then (a) spreads to the atria, causing them to contract. The signal is (b) delayed at the\natrioventricular node before it is passed on to the (c) heart apex. The delay allows the atria to relax before the (d) ventricles contract. The\nfinal part of the ECG cycle prepares the heart for the next beat.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/electric_heart) to see the heart\u2019s \u201cpacemaker\u201d in action.\nArteries, Veins, and Capillaries\nThe blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels (Figure 40.15). Arteries take blood\naway from the heart. The main artery is the aorta that branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs and organs.\nThese major arteries include the carotid artery that takes blood to the brain, the brachial arteries that take blood to the arms,\nand the thoracic artery that takes blood to the thorax and then into the hepatic, renal, and gastric arteries for the liver, kidney,\nand stomach, respectively. The iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs. The major arteries diverge into minor arteries, and\nthen smaller vessels called arterioles, to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body.\n40.3 \u2022 Mammalian Heart and Blood Vessels\n1163\nFigure 40.15 The major human arteries and veins are shown. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nArterioles diverge into capillary beds. Capillary beds contain a large number (10 to 100) of capillaries that branch among the\ncells and tissues of the body. Capillaries are narrow-diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single file and are the\nsites for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level. Fluid also crosses into the interstitial\nspace from the capillaries. The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major\nveins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart. Veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart. The\nmajor veins drain blood from the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply. Fluid is also brought back to the heart\nvia the lymphatic system.\nThe structure of the different types of blood vessels reflects their function or layers. There are three distinct layers, or tunics, that\nform the walls of blood vessels (Figure 40.16). The first tunic is a smooth, inner lining of endothelial cells that are in contact with\nthe red blood cells. The endothelial tunic is continuous with the endocardium of the heart. In capillaries, this single layer of cells\nis the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells, as well as the\nexchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis. The movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by\nvasoconstriction, narrowing of the blood vessels, and vasodilation, widening of the blood vessels; this is important in the\noverall regulation of blood pressure.\nVeins and arteries both have two further tunics that surround the endothelium: the middle tunic is composed of smooth muscle\nand the outermost layer is connective tissue (collagen and elastic fibers). The elastic connective tissue stretches and supports the\nblood vessels, and the smooth muscle layer helps regulate blood flow by altering vascular resistance through vasoconstriction\nand vasodilation. The arteries have thicker smooth muscle and connective tissue than the veins to accommodate the higher\npressure and speed of freshly pumped blood. The veins are thinner walled as the pressure and rate of flow are much lower. In\naddition, veins are structurally different than arteries in that veins have valves to prevent the backflow of blood. Because veins\nhave to work against gravity to get blood back to the heart, contraction of skeletal muscle assists with the flow of blood back to\nthe heart.\n1164\nChapter 40 \u2022 The Circulatory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 40.16 Arteries and veins consist of three layers: an outer tunica externa, a middle tunica media, and an inner tunica intima.\nCapillaries consist of a single layer of epithelial cells, the tunica intima.

The optimal\nsystolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the vessels between heartbeats. The\noptimal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg. Many factors can affect blood pressure, such as hormones, stress, exercise, eating,\nsitting, and standing. Blood flow through the body is regulated by the size of blood vessels, by the action of smooth muscle, by\none-way valves, and by the fluid pressure of the blood itself.\nHow Blood Flows Through the Body\nBlood is pushed through the body by the action of the pumping heart. With each rhythmic pump, blood is pushed under high\npressure and velocity away from the heart, initially along the main artery, the aorta. In the aorta, the blood travels at 30 cm/sec.\nAs blood moves into the arteries, arterioles, and ultimately to the capillary beds, the rate of movement slows dramatically to\nabout 0.026 cm/sec, one-thousand times slower than the rate of movement in the aorta. While the diameter of each individual\narteriole and capillary is far narrower than the diameter of the aorta, and according to the law of continuity, fluid should travel\nfaster through a narrower diameter tube, the rate is actually slower due to the overall diameter of all the combined capillaries\nbeing far greater than the diameter of the individual aorta.\nThe slow rate of travel through the capillary beds, which reach almost every cell in the body, assists with gas and nutrient\nexchange and also promotes the diffusion of fluid into the interstitial space. After the blood has passed through the capillary\nbeds to the venules, veins, and finally to the main venae cavae, the rate of flow increases again but is still much slower than the\ninitial rate in the aorta. Blood primarily moves in the veins by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and\nby the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves. Because most veins must move blood against the pull of gravity, blood is\nprevented from flowing backward in the veins by one-way valves. Because skeletal muscle contraction aids in venous blood flow,\nit is important to get up and move frequently after long periods of sitting so that blood will not pool in the extremities.\nBlood flow through the capillary beds is regulated depending on the body\u2019s needs and is directed by nerve and hormone signals.\nFor example, after a large meal, most of the blood is diverted to the stomach by vasodilation of vessels of the digestive system\nand vasoconstriction of other vessels. During exercise, blood is diverted to the skeletal muscles through vasodilation while blood\nto the digestive system would be lessened through vasoconstriction. The blood entering some capillary beds is controlled by\nsmall muscles, called precapillary sphincters, illustrated in Figure 40.17. If the sphincters are open, the blood will flow into the\n40.4 \u2022 Blood Flow and Blood Pressure Regulation\n1165\nassociated branches of the capillary blood. If all of the sphincters are closed, then the blood will flow directly from the arteriole\nto the venule through the thoroughfare channel (see Figure 40.17). These muscles allow the body to precisely control when\ncapillary beds receive blood flow. At any given moment only about 5\u201310% of our capillary beds actually have blood flowing\nthrough them.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 40.17 (a) Precapillary sphincters are rings of smooth muscle that regulate the flow of blood through capillaries; they help control the\nlocation of blood flow to where it is needed. (b) Valves in the veins prevent blood from moving backward. (credit a: modification of work by\nNCI)\nVaricose veins are veins that become enlarged because the valves no longer close properly, allowing blood to flow backward.\nVaricose veins are often most prominent on the legs. Why do you think this is the case?\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSee the circulatory system\u2019s blood flow.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/circulation)\nProteins and other large solutes cannot leave the capillaries. The loss of the watery plasma creates a hyperosmotic solution\nwithin the capillaries, especially near the venules. This causes about 85% of the plasma that leaves the capillaries to eventually\ndiffuse back into the capillaries near the venules. The remaining 15% of blood plasma drains out from the interstitial fluid into\nnearby lymphatic vessels (Figure 40.18). The fluid in the lymph is similar in composition to the interstitial fluid. The lymph fluid\npasses through lymph nodes before it returns to the heart via the vena cava. Lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the\nlymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells. The white blood cells remove infectious\nagents, such as bacteria and viruses, to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream. After it is cleaned, the lymph\nreturns to the heart by the action of smooth muscle pumping, skeletal muscle action, and one-way valves joining the returning\nblood near the junction of the venae cavae entering the right atrium of the heart.\n1166\nChapter 40 \u2022 The Circulatory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 40.18 Fluid from the capillaries moves into the interstitial space and lymph capillaries by diffusion down a pressure gradient and\nalso by osmosis. Out of 7,200 liters of fluid pumped by the average heart in a day, over 1,500 liters is filtered. (credit: modification of work\nby NCI, NIH)\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nVertebrate Diversity in Blood Circulation\nBlood circulation has evolved differently in vertebrates and may show variation in different animals for the required amount of\npressure, organ and vessel location, and organ size. Animals with longs necks and those that live in cold environments have\ndistinct blood pressure adaptations.\nLong necked animals, such as giraffes, need to pump blood upward from the heart against gravity. The blood pressure required\nfrom the pumping of the left ventricle would be equivalent to 250 mm Hg (mm Hg = millimeters of mercury, a unit of pressure)\nto reach the height of a giraffe\u2019s head, which is 2.5 meters higher than the heart. However, if checks and balances were not in\nplace, this blood pressure would damage the giraffe\u2019s brain, particularly if it was bending down to drink. These checks and\nbalances include valves and feedback mechanisms that reduce the rate of cardiac output. Long-necked dinosaurs such as the\nsauropods had to pump blood even higher, up to ten meters above the heart. This would have required a blood pressure of more\nthan 600 mm Hg, which could only have been achieved by an enormous heart. Evidence for such an enormous heart does not\nexist and mechanisms to reduce the blood pressure required include the slowing of metabolism as these animals grew larger. It\nis likely that they did not routinely feed on tree tops but grazed on the ground.\nLiving in cold water, whales need to maintain the temperature in their blood. This is achieved by the veins and arteries being\nclose together so that heat exchange can occur. This mechanism is called a countercurrent heat exchanger. The blood vessels and\nthe whole body are also protected by thick layers of blubber to prevent heat loss. In land animals that live in cold environments,\nthick fur and hibernation are used to retain heat and slow metabolism.\nBlood Pressure\nThe pressure of the blood flow in the body is produced by the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid (blood) against the walls of the\nblood vessels. Fluid will move from areas of high to low hydrostatic pressures. In the arteries, the hydrostatic pressure near the\nheart is very high and blood flows to the arterioles where the rate of flow is slowed by the narrow openings of the arterioles.\nDuring systole, when new blood is entering the arteries, the artery walls stretch to accommodate the increase of pressure of the\nextra blood; during diastole, the walls return to normal because of their elastic properties. The blood pressure of the systole\nphase and the diastole phase, graphed in Figure 40.19, gives the two pressure readings for blood pressure. For example, 120/80\nindicates a reading of 120 mm Hg during the systole and 80 mm Hg during diastole. Throughout the cardiac cycle, the blood\ncontinues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate. This resistance to blood flow is called peripheral resistance.\n40.4 \u2022 Blood Flow and Blood Pressure Regulation\n1167\nFigure 40.19 Blood pressure is related to the blood velocity in the arteries and arterioles. In the capillaries and veins, the blood pressure\ncontinues to decrease but velocity increases.\nBlood Pressure Regulation\nCardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute. It is calculated by multiplying the number of heart\ncontractions that occur per minute (heart rate) times the stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped into the aorta per\ncontraction of the left ventricle). Therefore, cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate, as when exercising.\nHowever, cardiac output can also be increased by increasing stroke volume, such as if the heart contracts with greater strength.\nStroke volume can also be increased by speeding blood circulation through the body so that more blood enters the heart between\ncontractions. During heavy exertion, the blood vessels relax and increase in diameter, offsetting the increased heart rate and\nensuring adequate oxygenated blood gets to the muscles. Stress triggers a decrease in the diameter of the blood vessels,\nconsequently increasing blood pressure. These changes can also be caused by nerve signals or hormones, and even standing up\nor lying down can have a great effect on blood pressure.\n1168\nChapter 40 \u2022 The Circulatory System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nangina\npain caused by partial blockage of the coronary\narteries by the buildup of plaque and lack of oxygen to the\nheart muscle\naorta\nmajor artery of the body that takes blood away from\nthe heart\narteriole\nsmall vessel that connects an artery to a capillary\nbed\nartery\nblood vessel that takes blood away from the heart\natherosclerosis\nbuildup of fatty plaques in the coronary\narteries in the heart\natrioventricular valve\none-way membranous flap of\nconnective tissue between the atrium and the ventricle in\nthe right side of the heart;

Some primitive animals use\ndiffusion for the exchange of water, nutrients, and gases.\nHowever, complex organisms use the circulatory system to\ncarry gases, nutrients, and waste through the body.\nCirculatory systems may be open (mixed with the interstitial\nfluid) or closed (separated from the interstitial fluid). Closed\ncirculatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates;\nhowever, there are significant differences in the structure of\nthe heart and the circulation of blood between the different\nvertebrate groups due to adaptions during evolution and\nassociated differences in anatomy. Fish have a two-\nchambered heart with unidirectional circulation.\nAmphibians have a three-chambered heart, which has some\nmixing of the blood, and they have double circulation. Most\nnon-avian reptiles have a three-chambered heart, but have\nlittle mixing of the blood; they have double circulation.\nMammals and birds have a four-chambered heart with no\nmixing of the blood and double circulation.\n40.2 Components of the Blood\nSpecific components of the blood include red blood cells,\nwhite blood cells, platelets, and the plasma, which contains\ncoagulation factors and serum. Blood is important for\nregulation of the body\u2019s pH, temperature, osmotic pressure,\nthe circulation of nutrients and removal of waste, the\ndistribution of hormones from endocrine glands, and the\nelimination of excess heat; it also contains components for\nblood clotting. Red blood cells are specialized cells that\ncontain hemoglobin and circulate through the body\ndelivering oxygen to cells. White blood cells are involved in\nthe immune response to identify and target invading\nbacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms; they also\nrecycle waste components, such as old red blood cells.\nPlatelets and blood clotting factors cause the change of the\nsoluble protein fibrinogen to the insoluble protein fibrin at a\nwound site forming a plug. Plasma consists of 90 percent\nwater along with various substances, such as coagulation\nfactors and antibodies. The serum is the plasma component\nof the blood without the coagulation factors.\n40.3 Mammalian Heart and Blood\nVessels\nThe heart muscle pumps blood through three divisions of the\ncirculatory system: coronary, pulmonary, and systemic.\nThere is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and\none atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The pumping of\nthe heart is a function of cardiomyocytes, distinctive muscle\ncells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump\nrhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle. The\ninternal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial node, which is\nlocated near the wall of the right atrium. Electrical charges\npulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in\nunison; then the pulse reaches the atrioventricular node\nbetween the right atrium and right ventricle. A pause in the\nelectric signal allows the atria to empty completely into the\nventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood. The\nblood from the heart is carried through the body by a\ncomplex network of blood vessels; arteries take blood away\nfrom the heart, and veins bring blood back to the heart.\n40.4 Blood Flow and Blood Pressure\nRegulation\nBlood primarily moves through the body by the rhythmic\nmovement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and by the\naction of the skeletal muscle as the body moves. Blood is\nprevented from flowing backward in the veins by one-way\nvalves. Blood flow through the capillary beds is controlled by\n1170\nChapter 40 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nprecapillary sphincters to increase and decrease flow\ndepending on the body\u2019s needs and is directed by nerve and\nhormone signals. Lymph vessels take fluid that has leaked\nout of the blood to the lymph nodes where it is cleaned\nbefore returning to the heart. During systole, blood enters\nthe arteries, and the artery walls stretch to accommodate the\nextra blood. During diastole, the artery walls return to\nnormal. The blood pressure of the systole phase and the\ndiastole phase gives the two pressure readings for blood\npressure.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

Our bodies\u2019 complex\nsystems have developed ways to treat waste and maintain a balanced internal environment.\n(credit: modification of work by Redwin Law)\nINTRODUCTION The daily intake recommendation for human water consumption is eight to ten\nglasses of water. In order to achieve a healthy balance, the human body should excrete the eight to ten\nglasses of water every day. This occurs via the processes of urination, defecation, sweating and, to a\nsmall extent, respiration. The organs and tissues of the human body are soaked in fluids that are\nmaintained at constant temperature, pH, and solute concentration, all crucial elements of homeostasis.\nThe solutes in body fluids are mainly mineral salts and sugars, and osmotic regulation is the process by\nwhich the mineral salts and water are kept in balance. Osmotic homeostasis is maintained despite the\ninfluence of external factors like temperature, diet, and weather conditions.\nChapter Outline\n41.1 Osmoregulation\nand Osmotic\nBalance\n41.2 The Kidneys and\nOsmoregulatory\nOrgans\n41.3 Excretion Systems\n41.4 Nitrogenous Wastes\n41.5 Hormonal Control\nof Osmoregulatory\nFunctions\n41.1 Osmoregulation and Osmotic Balance\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDefine osmosis and explain its role within molecules\n\u2022\nExplain why osmoregulation and osmotic balance are important body functions\n\u2022\nDescribe active transport mechanisms\n\u2022\nExplain osmolarity and the way in which it is measured\n\u2022\nDescribe osmoregulators or osmoconformers and how these tools allow animals to adapt to\ndifferent environments\nOsmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an\nimbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane. Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of\nsalt and water balance (osmotic balance) across membranes within the body\u2019s fluids, which are composed of\nwater, plus electrolytes and non-electrolytes. An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when\ndissolved in water. A non-electrolyte, in contrast, doesn\u2019t dissociate into ions during water dissolution. Both\nelectrolytes and non-electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance. The body\u2019s fluids include blood plasma,\nthe cytosol within cells, and interstitial fluid, the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of\nthe body. The membranes of the body (such as the pleural, serous, and cell membranes) are semi-permeable\nmembranes. Semi-permeable membranes are permeable (or permissive) to certain types of solutes and\nwater. Solutions on two sides of a semi-permeable membrane tend to equalize in solute concentration by\nmovement of solutes and/or water across the membrane. As seen in Figure 41.2, a cell placed in water tends\nto swell due to gain of water from the hypotonic or \u201clow salt\u201d environment. A cell placed in a solution with\nhigher salt concentration, on the other hand, tends to make the membrane shrivel up due to loss of water\ninto the hypertonic or \u201chigh salt\u201d environment. Isotonic cells have an equal concentration of solutes inside\nand outside the cell; this equalizes the osmotic pressure on either side of the cell membrane which is a semi-\npermeable membrane.\nFigure 41.2 Cells placed in a hypertonic environment tend to shrink due to loss of water. In a hypotonic environment,\ncells tend to swell due to intake of water. The blood maintains an isotonic environment so that cells neither shrink nor\nswell. (credit: Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe body does not exist in isolation. There is a constant input of water and electrolytes into the system.\nWhile osmoregulation is achieved across membranes within the body, excess electrolytes and wastes are\ntransported to the kidneys and excreted, helping to maintain osmotic balance.\n1174\nChapter 41 \u2022 Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nNeed for Osmoregulation\nBiological systems constantly interact and exchange water and nutrients with the environment by way of consumption of food\nand water and through excretion in the form of sweat, urine, and feces. Without a mechanism to regulate osmotic pressure, or\nwhen a disease damages this mechanism, there is a tendency to accumulate toxic waste and water, which can have dire\nconsequences.\nMammalian systems have evolved to regulate not only the overall osmotic pressure across membranes, but also specific\nconcentrations of important electrolytes in the three major fluid compartments: blood plasma, extracellular fluid, and\nintracellular fluid. Since osmotic pressure is regulated by the movement of water across membranes, the volume of the fluid\ncompartments can also change temporarily. Because blood plasma is one of the fluid components, osmotic pressures have a\ndirect bearing on blood pressure.\nTransport of Electrolytes across Cell Membranes\nElectrolytes, such as sodium chloride, ionize in water, meaning that they dissociate into their component ions. In water, sodium\nchloride (NaCl), dissociates into the sodium ion (Na+) and the chloride ion (Cl\u2013). The most important ions, whose concentrations\nare very closely regulated in body fluids, are the cations sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), and\nthe anions chloride (Cl-), carbonate (CO3-2), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and phosphate(PO3-). Electrolytes are lost from the body\nduring urination and perspiration. For this reason, athletes are encouraged to replace electrolytes and fluids during periods of\nincreased activity and perspiration.\nOsmotic pressure is influenced by the concentration of solutes in a solution. It is directly proportional to the number of solute\natoms or molecules and not dependent on the size of the solute molecules. Because electrolytes dissociate into their component\nions, they, in essence, add more solute particles into the solution and have a greater effect on osmotic pressure, per mass than\ncompounds that do not dissociate in water, such as glucose.\nWater can pass through membranes by passive diffusion. If electrolyte ions could passively diffuse across membranes, it would\nbe impossible to maintain specific concentrations of ions in each fluid compartment therefore they require special mechanisms\nto cross the semi-permeable membranes in the body. This movement can be accomplished by facilitated diffusion and active\ntransport. Facilitated diffusion requires protein-based channels for moving the solute. Active transport requires energy in the\nform of ATP conversion, carrier proteins, or pumps in order to move ions against the concentration gradient.\nConcept of Osmolality and Milliequivalent\nIn order to calculate osmotic pressure, it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured. The unit for\nmeasuring solutes is the mole. One mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute. For example, the molecular\nweight of sodium chloride is 58.44. Thus, one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams. The molarity of a solution is the\nnumber of moles of solute per liter of solution. The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of\nsolvent. If the solvent is water, one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water. While molarity and molality are used to\nexpress the concentration of solutions, electrolyte concentrations are usually expressed in terms of milliequivalents per liter\n(mEq/L): the mEq/L is equal to the ion concentration (in millimoles) multiplied by the number of electrical charges on the ion.\nThe unit of milliequivalent takes into consideration the ions present in the solution (since electrolytes form ions in aqueous\nsolutions) and the charge on the ions.\nThus, for ions that have a charge of one, one milliequivalent is equal to one millimole. For ions that have a charge of two (like\ncalcium), one milliequivalent is equal to 0.5 millimoles. Another unit for the expression of electrolyte concentration is the\nmilliosmole (mOsm), which is the number of milliequivalents of solute per kilogram of solvent. Body fluids are usually\nmaintained within the range of 280 to 300 mOsm.\nOsmoregulators and Osmoconformers\nPersons lost at sea without any freshwater to drink are at risk of severe dehydration because the human body cannot adapt to\ndrinking seawater, which is hypertonic in comparison to body fluids. Organisms such as goldfish that can tolerate only a\nrelatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as stenohaline. About 90 percent of all bony fish are restricted to either\nfreshwater or seawater. They are incapable of osmotic regulation in the opposite environment. It is possible, however, for a few\nfishes like salmon to spend part of their life in freshwater and part in seawater. Organisms like the salmon and molly that can\ntolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms. This is possible because some fish have\n41.1 \u2022 Osmoregulation and Osmotic Balance\n1175\nevolved osmoregulatory mechanisms to survive in all kinds of aquatic environments. When they live in freshwater, their bodies\ntend to take up water because the environment is relatively hypotonic, as illustrated in Figure 41.3a. In such hypotonic\nenvironments, these fish do not drink much water. Instead, they pass a lot of very dilute urine, and they achieve electrolyte\nbalance by active transport of salts through the gills. When they move to a hypertonic marine environment, these fish start\ndrinking seawater; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine, as illustrated in Figure 41.3b. Most marine\ninvertebrates, on the other hand, may be isotonic with seawater (osmoconformers). Their body fluid concentrations conform to\nchanges in seawater concentration. Cartilaginous fishes\u2019 salt composition of the blood is similar to bony fishes; however, the\nblood of sharks contains the organic compounds urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). This does not mean that their\nelectrolyte composition is similar to that of seawater. They achieve isotonicity with the sea by storing large concentrations of\nurea. These animals that secrete urea are called ureotelic animals. TMAO stabilizes proteins in the presence of high urea levels,\npreventing the disruption of peptide bonds that would occur in other animals exposed to similar levels of urea. Sharks are\ncartilaginous fish with a rectal gland to secrete salt and assist in osmoregulation.\nFigure 41.3 Fish are osmoregulators, but must use different mechanisms to survive in (a) freshwater or (b) saltwater environments.

When kidney\nfunction fails, dialysis must be done to artificially rid the body of wastes. This is a vital process to keep patients alive. In some\ncases, the patients undergo artificial dialysis until they are eligible for a kidney transplant. In others who are not candidates for\nkidney transplants, dialysis is a life-long necessity.\nDialysis technicians typically work in hospitals and clinics. While some roles in this field include equipment development and\nmaintenance, most dialysis technicians work in direct patient care. Their on-the-job duties, which typically occur under the\n1176\nChapter 41 \u2022 Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ndirect supervision of a registered nurse, focus on providing dialysis treatments. This can include reviewing patient history and\ncurrent condition, assessing and responding to patient needs before and during treatment, and monitoring the dialysis process.\nTreatment may include taking and reporting a patient\u2019s vital signs and preparing solutions and equipment to ensure accurate\nand sterile procedures.\n41.2 The Kidneys and Osmoregulatory Organs\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how the kidneys serve as the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems\n\u2022\nDescribe the structure of the kidneys and the functions of the parts of the kidney\n\u2022\nDescribe how the nephron is the functional unit of the kidney and explain how it actively filters blood and\ngenerates urine\n\u2022\nDetail the three steps in the formation of urine: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular\nsecretion\nAlthough the kidneys are the major osmoregulatory organ, the skin and lungs also play a role in the process. Water and\nelectrolytes are lost through sweat glands in the skin, which helps moisturize and cool the skin surface, while the lungs expel a\nsmall amount of water in the form of mucous secretions and via evaporation of water vapor.\nKidneys: The Main Osmoregulatory Organ\nThe kidneys, illustrated in Figure 41.4, are a pair of bean-shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver\nin the peritoneal cavity. The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands. Kidneys filter\nblood and purify it. All the blood in the human body is filtered many times a day by the kidneys; these organs use up almost 25\npercent of the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to perform this function. Oxygen allows the kidney cells to efficiently\nmanufacture chemical energy in the form of ATP through aerobic respiration. The filtrate coming out of the kidneys is called\nurine.\nFigure 41.4 Kidneys filter the blood, producing urine that is stored in the bladder prior to elimination through the urethra. (credit:\nmodification of work by NCI)\nKidney Structure\nExternally, the kidneys are surrounded by three layers, illustrated in Figure 41.5. The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue\nlayer called the renal fascia. The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule, which helps anchor the kidneys in place. The\nthird and innermost layer is the renal capsule. Internally, the kidney has three regions\u2014an outer cortex, a medulla in the\n41.2 \u2022 The Kidneys and Osmoregulatory Organs\n1177\nmiddle, and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney. The hilum is the concave part of the bean-shape where\nblood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney; it is also the point of exit for the ureters. The renal cortex is granular due to\nthe presence of nephrons\u2014the functional unit of the kidney. The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses, called\nthe renal pyramids. In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels pass. The tips of\nthe pyramids, called renal papillae, point toward the renal pelvis. There are, on average, eight renal pyramids in each kidney. The\nrenal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the lobes of the kidney. The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on\nthe outside of the kidney. On the inside of the kidney, the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major\ncalyces, which further branch into the minor calyces. The ureters are urine-bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the\nurinary bladder.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 41.5 The internal structure of the kidney is shown. (credit: modification of work by NCI)\nWhich of the following statements about the kidney is false?\na.\nThe renal pelvis drains into the ureter.\nb.\nThe renal pyramids are in the medulla.\nc.\nThe cortex covers the capsule.\nd.\nNephrons are in the renal cortex.\nBecause the kidney filters blood, its network of blood vessels is an important component of its structure and function. The\narteries, veins, and nerves that supply the kidney enter and exit at the renal hilum. Renal blood supply starts with the branching\nof the aorta into the renal arteries (which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through) and ends with\nthe exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava. The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering\nthe kidneys. Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns, which supply the\nrenal lobes. The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries. The arcuate\n\u201cbow shaped\u201d arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids. Cortical radiate arteries, as the name suggests,\nradiate out from the arcuate arteries. The cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous afferent arterioles, and then enter the\ncapillaries supplying the nephrons. Veins trace the path of the arteries and have similar names, except there are no segmental\nveins.\nAs mentioned previously, the functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, illustrated in Figure 41.6. Each kidney is made up of\nover one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex, giving it a granular appearance when sectioned sagittally. There are two\ntypes of nephrons\u2014cortical nephrons (85 percent), which are deep in the renal cortex, and juxtamedullary nephrons (15\npercent), which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla. A nephron consists of three parts\u2014a renal corpuscle, a renal\ntubule, and the associated capillary network, which originates from the cortical radiate arteries.\n1178\nChapter 41 \u2022 Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 41.6 The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney. The glomerulus and convoluted tubules are located in the kidney cortex, while\ncollecting ducts are located in the pyramids of the medulla.

The first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) due to its proximity to the glomerulus; it stays in the\nrenal cortex. The second part is called the loop of Henle, or nephritic loop, because it forms a loop (with descending and\nascending limbs) that goes through the renal medulla. The third part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule\n(DCT) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex. The DCT, which is the last part of the nephron, connects and empties its\ncontents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids. The collecting ducts amass contents from multiple nephrons\nand fuse together as they enter the papillae of the renal medulla.\nCapillary Network within the Nephron\nThe capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered. The\nbranch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole. The branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent\narteriole. Within the glomerulus, the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed. Once the efferent arteriole\nexits the glomerulus, it forms the peritubular capillary network, which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule.\nIn cortical nephrons, the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT. In juxtamedullary nephrons, the\nperitubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called the vasa recta.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGo to this website (http://openstax.org/l/kidney_section) to see another coronal section of the kidney and to explore an\nanimation of the workings of nephrons.\n41.2 \u2022 The Kidneys and Osmoregulatory Organs\n1179\nKidney Function and Physiology\nKidneys filter blood in a three-step process. First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the\nglomerulus. Almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called glomerular filtration.\nSecond, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular\nreabsorption. In the loop of Henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the\nperitubular capillary network. Water is also reabsorbed during this step. Then, additional solutes and wastes are secreted into\nthe kidney tubules during tubular secretion, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular reabsorption. The collecting\nducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae. From here, the papillae deliver the filtrate,\nnow called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the renal pelvis. This entire process is\nillustrated in Figure 41.7.\nFigure 41.7 Each part of the nephron performs a different function in filtering waste and maintaining homeostatic balance. (1) The\nglomerulus forces small solutes out of the blood by pressure. (2) The proximal convoluted tubule reabsorbs ions, water, and nutrients from\nthe filtrate into the interstitial fluid, and actively transports toxins and drugs from the interstitial fluid into the filtrate. The proximal\nconvoluted tubule also adjusts blood pH by selectively secreting ammonia (NH3) into the filtrate, where it reacts with H+ to form NH4+. The\nmore acidic the filtrate, the more ammonia is secreted. (3) The descending loop of Henle is lined with cells containing aquaporins that allow\nwater to pass from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid. (4) In the thin part of the ascending loop of Henle, Na+ and Cl- ions diffuse into the\ninterstitial fluid. In the thick part, these same ions are actively transported into the interstitial fluid. Because salt but not water is lost, the\nfiltrate becomes more dilute as it travels up the limb. (5) In the distal convoluted tubule, K+ and H+ ions are selectively secreted into the\nfiltrate, while Na+, Cl-, and HCO3- ions are reabsorbed to maintain pH and electrolyte balance in the blood. (6) The collecting duct reabsorbs\nsolutes and water from the filtrate, forming dilute urine. (credit: modification of work by NIDDK)\nGlomerular Filtration\nGlomerular filtration filters out most of the solutes due to high blood pressure and specialized membranes in the afferent\narteriole. The blood pressure in the glomerulus is maintained independent of factors that affect systemic blood pressure. The\n\u201cleaky\u201d connections between the endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary network allow solutes to pass through easily. All\nsolutes in the glomerular capillaries, except for macromolecules like proteins, pass through by passive diffusion. There is no\nenergy requirement at this stage of the filtration process. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of glomerular filtrate\nformed per minute by the kidneys. GFR is regulated by multiple mechanisms and is an important indicator of kidney function.\n1180\nChapter 41 \u2022 Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo learn more about the vascular system of kidneys, click through this review (http://openstax.org/l/kidneys) and the steps of\nblood flow.\nTubular Reabsorption and Secretion\nTubular reabsorption occurs in the PCT part of the renal tubule. Almost all nutrients are reabsorbed, and this occurs either by\npassive or active transport. Reabsorption of water and some key electrolytes are regulated and can be influenced by hormones.\nSodium (Na+) is the most abundant ion and most of it is reabsorbed by active transport and then transported to the peritubular\ncapillaries. Because Na+ is actively transported out of the tubule, water follows it to even out the osmotic pressure. Water is also\nindependently reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries due to the presence of aquaporins, or water channels, in the PCT. This\noccurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries. However, every solute has a\ntransport maximum and the excess is not reabsorbed.\nIn the loop of Henle, the permeability of the membrane changes. The descending limb is permeable to water, not solutes; the\nopposite is true for the ascending limb. Additionally, the loop of Henle invades the renal medulla, which is naturally high in salt\nconcentration and tends to absorb water from the renal tubule and concentrate the filtrate. The osmotic gradient increases as it\nmoves deeper into the medulla. Because two sides of the loop of Henle perform opposing functions, as illustrated in Figure 41.8,\nit acts as a countercurrent multiplier. The vasa recta around it acts as the countercurrent exchanger.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 41.8 The loop of Henle acts as a countercurrent multiplier that uses energy to create concentration gradients. The descending limb\nis water permeable. Water flows from the filtrate to the interstitial fluid, so osmolality inside the limb increases as it descends into the renal\nmedulla. At the bottom, the osmolality is higher inside the loop than in the interstitial fluid. Thus, as filtrate enters the ascending limb, Na+\nand Cl- ions exit through ion channels present in the cell membrane. Further up, Na+ is actively transported out of the filtrate and Cl-\nfollows. Osmolarity is given in units of milliosmoles per liter (mOsm/L).\nLoop diuretics are drugs sometimes used to treat hypertension. These drugs inhibit the reabsorption of Na+ and Cl- ions by the\nascending limb of the loop of Henle. A side effect is that they increase urination. Why do you think this is the case?\nBy the time the filtrate reaches the DCT, most of the urine and solutes have been reabsorbed. If the body requires additional\nwater, all of it can be reabsorbed at this point. Further reabsorption is controlled by hormones, which will be discussed in a later\nsection. Excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption combined with tubular secretion. Undesirable products like\nmetabolic wastes, urea, uric acid, and certain drugs, are excreted by tubular secretion. Most of the tubular secretion happens in\n41.2 \u2022 The Kidneys and Osmoregulatory Organs\n1181\nthe DCT, but some occurs in the early part of the collecting duct. Kidneys also maintain an acid-base balance by secreting excess\nH+ ions.\nAlthough parts of the renal tubules are named proximal and distal, in a cross-section of the kidney, the tubules are placed close\ntogether and in contact with each other and the glomerulus. This allows for exchange of chemical messengers between the\ndifferent cell types. For example, the DCT ascending limb of the loop of Henle has masses of cells called macula densa, which are\nin contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called juxtaglomerular cells. Together, the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells\nform the juxtaglomerular complex (JGC). The JGC is an endocrine structure that secretes the enzyme renin and the hormone\nerythropoietin. When hormones trigger the macula densa cells in the DCT due to variations in blood volume, blood pressure, or\nelectrolyte balance, these cells can immediately communicate the problem to the capillaries in the afferent and efferent\narterioles, which can constrict or relax to change the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nNephrologist\nA nephrologist studies and deals with diseases of the kidneys\u2014both those that cause kidney failure (such as diabetes) and the\nconditions that are produced by kidney disease (such as hypertension). Blood pressure, blood volume, and changes in electrolyte\nbalance come under the purview of a nephrologist.\nNephrologists usually work with other physicians who refer patients to them or consult with them about specific diagnoses and\ntreatment plans. Patients are usually referred to a nephrologist for symptoms such as blood or protein in the urine, very high\nblood pressure, kidney stones, or renal failure.\nNephrology is a subspecialty of internal medicine. To become a nephrologist, medical school is followed by additional training to\nbecome certified in internal medicine. An additional two or more years is spent specifically studying kidney disorders and their\naccompanying effects on the body.\n41.3 Excretion Systems\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how vacuoles, present in microorganisms, work to excrete waste\n\u2022\nDescribe the way in which flame cells and nephridia in worms perform excretory functions and maintain\nosmotic balance\n\u2022\nExplain how insects use Malpighian tubules to excrete wastes and maintain osmotic balance\nMicroorganisms and invertebrate animals use more primitive and simple mechanisms to get rid of their metabolic wastes than\nthe mammalian system of kidney and urinary function. Three excretory systems evolved in organisms before complex kidneys:\nvacuoles, flame cells, and Malpighian tubules.\nContractile Vacuoles in Microorganisms\nThe most fundamental feature of life is the presence of a cell. In other words, a cell is the simplest functional unit of a life.\nBacteria are unicellular, prokaryotic organisms that have some of the least complex life processes in place; however, prokaryotes\nsuch as bacteria do not contain membrane-bound vacuoles. The cells of microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa, and fungi are\nbound by cell membranes and use them to interact with the environment. Some cells, including some leucocytes in humans, are\nable to engulf food by endocytosis\u2014the formation of vesicles by involution of the cell membrane within the cells. The same\nvesicles are able to interact and exchange metabolites with the intracellular environment. In some unicellular eukaryotic\norganisms such as the amoeba, shown in Figure 41.9, cellular wastes and excess water are excreted by exocytosis, when the\ncontractile vacuoles merge with the cell membrane and expel wastes into the environment. Contractile vacuoles (CV) should not\nbe confused with vacuoles, which store food or water.\n1182\nChapter 41 \u2022 Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 41.9 Some unicellular organisms, such as the amoeba, ingest food by endocytosis. The food vesicle fuses with a lysosome, which\ndigests the food. Waste is excreted by exocytosis.\nFlame Cells of Planaria and Nephridia of Worms\nAs multicellular systems evolved to have organ systems that divided the metabolic needs of the body, individual organs evolved\nto perform the excretory function. Planaria are flatworms that live in freshwater. Their excretory system consists of two tubules\nconnected to a highly branched duct system. The cells in the tubules are called flame cells (or protonephridia) because they have\na cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope, as illustrated in Figure 41.10a. The cilia\npropel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface; cilia also draw\nwater from the interstitial fluid, allowing for filtration. Any valuable metabolites are recovered by reabsorption. Flame cells are\nfound in flatworms, including parasitic tapeworms and free-living planaria. They also maintain the organism\u2019s osmotic balance.\nFigure 41.10 In the excretory system of the (a) planaria, cilia of flame cells propel waste through a tubule formed by a tube cell. Tubules\nare connected into branched structures that lead to pores located all along the sides of the body. The filtrate is secreted through these\npores. In (b) annelids such as earthworms, nephridia filter fluid from the coelom, or body cavity. Beating cilia at the opening of the\nnephridium draw water from the coelom into a tubule. As the filtrate passes down the tubules, nutrients and other solutes are reabsorbed\nby capillaries. Filtered fluid containing nitrogenous and other wastes is stored in a bladder and then secreted through a pore in the side of\nthe body.\nEarthworms (annelids) have slightly more evolved excretory structures called nephridia, illustrated in Figure 41.10b. A pair of\nnephridia is present on each segment of the earthworm. They are similar to flame cells in that they have a tubule with cilia.\nExcretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore. They are more evolved than the flame cells in that they have a system\nfor tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion.\nMalpighian Tubules of Insects\nMalpighian tubules are found lining the gut of some species of arthropods, such as the bee illustrated in Figure 41.11. They are\nusually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect. Malpighian tubules are convoluted, which\nincreases their surface area, and they are lined with microvilli for reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance.\nMalpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall of the rectum. Body fluids are not filtered as in the\ncase of nephridia; urine is produced by tubular secretion mechanisms by the cells lining the Malpighian tubules that are bathed\nin hemolymph (a mixture of blood and interstitial fluid that is found in insects and other arthropods as well as most mollusks).\n41.3 \u2022 Excretion Systems\n1183\nMetabolic wastes like uric acid freely diffuse into the tubules. There are exchange pumps lining the tubules, which actively\ntransport H+ ions into the cell and K+ or Na+ ions out; water passively follows to form urine. The secretion of ions alters the\nosmotic pressure which draws water, electrolytes, and nitrogenous waste (uric acid) into the tubules. Water and electrolytes are\nreabsorbed when these organisms are faced with low-water environments, and uric acid is excreted as a thick paste or powder.\nNot dissolving wastes in water helps these organisms to conserve water; this is especially important for life in dry environments.\nFigure 41.11 Malpighian tubules of insects and other terrestrial arthropods remove nitrogenous wastes and other solutes from the\nhemolymph. Na+ and/or K+ ions are actively transported into the lumen of the tubules. Water then enters the tubules via osmosis, forming\nurine. The urine passes through the intestine, and into the rectum. There, nutrients diffuse back into the hemolymph. Na+ and/or K+ ions are\npumped into the hemolymph, and water follows. The concentrated waste is then excreted.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSee a dissected cockroach, including a close-up look at its Malpighian tubules, in this video (https://openstax.org/l/malpighian)\n.\n41.4 Nitrogenous Wastes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nCompare and contrast the way in which aquatic animals and terrestrial animals can eliminate toxic ammonia\nfrom their systems\n\u2022\nCompare the major byproduct of ammonia metabolism in vertebrate animals to that of birds, insects, and\nreptiles\nOf the four major macromolecules in biological systems, both proteins and nucleic acids contain nitrogen. During the\ncatabolism, or breakdown, of nitrogen-containing macromolecules, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are extracted and stored in\nthe form of carbohydrates and fats. Excess nitrogen is excreted from the body. Nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic ammonia,\nwhich raises the pH of body fluids. The formation of ammonia itself requires energy in the form of ATP and large quantities of\nwater to dilute it out of a biological system. Animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water.\nAnimals that excrete ammonia are said to be ammonotelic. Terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to excrete\nnitrogenous wastes. The animals must detoxify ammonia by converting it into a relatively nontoxic form such as urea or uric\nacid. Mammals, including humans, produce urea, whereas reptiles and many terrestrial invertebrates produce uric acid.\nAnimals that secrete urea as the primary nitrogenous waste material are called ureotelic animals.\nNitrogenous Waste in Terrestrial Animals: The Urea Cycle\nThe urea cycle is the primary mechanism by which mammals convert ammonia to urea. Urea is made in the liver and excreted in\nurine. The overall chemical reaction by which ammonia is converted to urea is 2 NH3 (ammonia) + CO2 + 3 ATP + H2O \u2192 H2N-\nCO-NH2 (urea) + 2 ADP + 4 Pi + AMP.\n1184\nChapter 41 \u2022 Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe urea cycle utilizes five intermediate steps, catalyzed by five different enzymes, to convert ammonia to urea, as shown in\nFigure 41.12. The amino acid L-ornithine gets converted into different intermediates before being regenerated at the end of the\nurea cycle. Hence, the urea cycle is also referred to as the ornithine cycle. The enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes a key\nstep in the urea cycle and its deficiency can lead to accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the body. The first two reactions\noccur in the mitochondria and the last three reactions occur in the cytosol. Urea concentration in the blood, called blood urea\nnitrogen or BUN, is used as an indicator of kidney function.\nFigure 41.12 The urea cycle converts ammonia to urea.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nExcretion of Nitrogenous Waste\nThe theory of evolution proposes that life started in an aquatic environment. It is not surprising to see that biochemical\npathways like the urea cycle evolved to adapt to a changing environment when terrestrial life forms evolved. Arid conditions\nprobably led to the evolution of the uric acid pathway as a means of conserving water.\n41.4 \u2022 Nitrogenous Wastes\n1185\nNitrogenous Waste in Birds and Reptiles: Uric Acid\nBirds, reptiles, and most terrestrial arthropods convert toxic ammonia to uric acid or the closely related compound guanine\n(guano) instead of urea. Mammals also form some uric acid during breakdown of nucleic acids. Uric acid is a compound similar\nto purines found in nucleic acids. It is water insoluble and tends to form a white paste or powder; it is excreted by birds, insects,\nand reptiles. Conversion of ammonia to uric acid requires more energy and is much more complex than conversion of ammonia\nto urea Figure 41.13.\nFigure 41.13 Nitrogenous waste is excreted in different forms by different species. These include (a) ammonia, (b) urea, and (c) uric acid.\n(credit a: modification of work by Eric Engbretson, USFWS; credit b: modification of work by B. \"Moose\" Peterson, USFWS; credit c:\nmodification of work by Dave Menke, USFWS)\n41.5 Hormonal Control of Osmoregulatory Functions\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain how hormonal cues help the kidneys synchronize the osmotic needs of the body\n\u2022\nDescribe how hormones like epinephrine, norepinephrine, renin-angiotensin, aldosterone, anti-diuretic\nhormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide help regulate waste elimination, maintain correct osmolarity, and\nperform other osmoregulatory functions\nWhile the kidneys operate to maintain osmotic balance and blood pressure in the body, they also act in concert with hormones.\nEveryday Connection\nGout\nMammals use uric acid crystals as an antioxidant in their cells. However, too much uric acid tends to form kidney stones\nand may also cause a painful condition called gout, where uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints, as illustrated in Figure\n41.14. Food choices that reduce the amount of nitrogenous bases in the diet help reduce the risk of gout. For example, tea,\ncoffee, and chocolate have purine-like compounds, called xanthines, and should be avoided by people with gout and kidney\nstones.\nFigure 41.14 Gout causes the inflammation visible in this person\u2019s left big toe joint.

Hormones are typically secreted from one cell and travel\nin the bloodstream to affect a target cell in another portion of the body. Different regions of the nephron bear specialized cells\nthat have receptors to respond to chemical messengers and hormones. Table 41.1 summarizes the hormones that control the\nosmoregulatory functions.\nHormones That Affect Osmoregulation\nHormone\nWhere produced\nFunction\nEpinephrine and\nNorepinephrine\nAdrenal medulla\nCan decrease kidney function temporarily by vasoconstriction\nRenin\nKidney nephrons\nIncreases blood pressure by acting on angiotensinogen\nAngiotensin\nLiver\nAngiotensin II affects multiple processes and increases blood pressure\nAldosterone\nAdrenal cortex\nPrevents loss of sodium and water\nAnti-diuretic\nhormone\n(vasopressin)\nHypothalamus (stored in\nthe posterior pituitary)\nPrevents water loss\nAtrial natriuretic\npeptide\nHeart atrium\nDecreases blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator and increasing\nglomerular filtration rate; decreases sodium reabsorption in kidneys\nTable 41.1\nEpinephrine and Norepinephrine\nEpinephrine and norepinephrine are released by the adrenal medulla and nervous system respectively. They are the flight/fight\nhormones that are released when the body is under extreme stress. During stress, much of the body\u2019s energy is used to combat\nimminent danger. Kidney function is halted temporarily by epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones function by\nacting directly on the smooth muscles of blood vessels to constrict them. Once the afferent arterioles are constricted, blood flow\ninto the nephrons stops. These hormones go one step further and trigger the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\nRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, illustrated in Figure 41.15 proceeds through several steps to produce angiotensin II,\nwhich acts to stabilize blood pressure and volume. Renin (secreted by a part of the juxtaglomerular complex) is produced by the\ngranular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles. Thus, the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly. Renin acts on\nangiotensinogen, which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts\nangiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels. It also triggers the release of\nthe mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which in turn stimulates the renal tubules to reabsorb more sodium.\nAngiotensin II also triggers the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) from the hypothalamus, leading to water retention in\nthe kidneys. It acts directly on the nephrons and decreases glomerular filtration rate. Medically, blood pressure can be controlled\nby drugs that inhibit ACE (called ACE inhibitors).\n41.5 \u2022 Hormonal Control of Osmoregulatory Functions\n1187\nFigure 41.15 The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system increases blood pressure and volume. The hormone ANP has antagonistic effects.\n(credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nMineralocorticoids\nMineralocorticoids are hormones synthesized by the adrenal cortex that affect osmotic balance. Aldosterone is a\nmineralocorticoid that regulates sodium levels in the blood. Almost all of the sodium in the blood is reclaimed by the renal\ntubules under the influence of aldosterone. Because sodium is always reabsorbed by active transport and water follows sodium\nto maintain osmotic balance, aldosterone manages not only sodium levels but also the water levels in body fluids. In contrast,\nthe aldosterone also stimulates potassium secretion concurrently with sodium reabsorption. In contrast, absence of aldosterone\nmeans that no sodium gets reabsorbed in the renal tubules and all of it gets excreted in the urine. In addition, the daily dietary\npotassium load is not secreted and the retention of K+ can cause a dangerous increase in plasma K+ concentration. Patients who\nhave Addison's disease have a failing adrenal cortex and cannot produce aldosterone. They lose sodium in their urine constantly,\nand if the supply is not replenished, the consequences can be fatal.\nAntidiuretic Hormone\nAs previously discussed, antidiuretic hormone or ADH (also called vasopressin), as the name suggests, helps the body conserve\nwater when body fluid volume, especially that of blood, is low. It is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored and released from\nthe posterior pituitary. It acts by inserting aquaporins in the collecting ducts and promotes reabsorption of water. ADH also acts\nas a vasoconstrictor and increases blood pressure during hemorrhaging.\nAtrial Natriuretic Peptide Hormone\nThe atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) lowers blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator. It is released by cells in the atrium of the\nheart in response to high blood pressure and in patients with sleep apnea. ANP affects salt release, and because water passively\nfollows salt to maintain osmotic balance, it also has a diuretic effect. ANP also prevents sodium reabsorption by the renal\ntubules, decreasing water reabsorption (thus acting as a diuretic) and lowering blood pressure. Its actions suppress the actions\nof aldosterone, ADH, and renin.\n1188\nChapter 41 \u2022 Osmotic Regulation and Excretion\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nafferent arteriole\narteriole that branches from the cortical\nradiate artery and enters the glomerulus\nammonia\ncompound made of one nitrogen atom and three\nhydrogen atoms\nammonotelic\ndescribes an animal that excretes ammonia\nas the primary waste material\nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)\nenzyme that\nconverts angiotensin I to angiotensin II\nangiotensin I\nproduct in the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone pathway\nangiotensin II\nmolecule that affects different organs to\nincrease blood pressure\nanti-diuretic hormone (ADH)\nhormone that prevents the\nloss of water\nantioxidant\nagent that prevents cell destruction by reactive\noxygen species\narcuate artery\nartery that branches from the interlobar\nartery and arches over the base of the renal pyramids\nascending limb\npart of the loop of Henle that ascends from\nthe renal medulla to the renal cortex\nblood urea nitrogen (BUN)\nestimate of urea in the blood\nand an indicator of kidney function\nBowman's capsule\nstructure that encloses the glomerulus\ncalyx\nstructure that connects the renal pelvis to the renal\nmedulla\ncortex (animal)\nouter layer of an organ like the kidney or\nadrenal gland\ncortical nephron\nnephron that lies in the renal cortex\ncortical radiate artery\nartery that radiates from the arcuate\narteries into the renal cortex\ncountercurrent exchanger\nperitubular capillary network\nthat allows exchange of solutes and water from the renal\ntubules\ncountercurrent multiplier\nosmotic gradient in the renal\nmedulla that is responsible for concentration of urine\ndescending limb\npart of the loop of Henle that descends\nfrom the renal cortex into the renal medulla\ndistal convoluted tubule (DCT)\npart of the renal tubule that\nis the most distant from the glomerulus\nefferent arteriole\narteriole that exits from the glomerulus\nelectrolyte\nsolute that breaks down into ions when\ndissolved in water\nflame cell\n(also, protonephridia) excretory cell found in\nflatworms\nglomerular filtration\nfiltration of blood in the glomerular\ncapillary network into the glomerulus\nglomerular filtration rate (GFR)\namount of filtrate formed\nby the glomerulus per minute\nglomerulus (renal)\npart of the renal corpuscle that contains\nthe capillary network\nhilum\nregion in the renal pelvis where blood vessels,\nnerves, and ureters bunch before entering or exiting the\nkidney\ninferior vena cava\none of the main veins in the human body\ninterlobar artery\nartery that branches from the segmental\nartery and travels in between the renal lobes\njuxtaglomerular cell\ncell in the afferent and efferent\narterioles that responds to stimuli from the macula densa\njuxtamedullary nephron\nnephron that lies in the cortex but\nclose to the renal medulla\nkidney\norgan that performs excretory and osmoregulatory\nfunctions\nlobes of the kidney\nrenal pyramid along with the adjoining\ncortical region\nloop of Henle\npart of the renal tubule that loops into the\nrenal medulla\nmacula densa\ngroup of cells that senses changes in sodium\nion concentration;

It is the number of solute molecules and not the\nmolecular size that is important in osmosis. Osmoregulation\nand osmotic balance are important bodily functions,\nresulting in water and salt balance. Not all solutes can pass\nthrough a semi-permeable membrane. Osmosis is the\nmovement of water across the membrane. Osmosis occurs to\nequalize the number of solute molecules across a semi-\npermeable membrane by the movement of water to the side\nof higher solute concentration. Facilitated diffusion utilizes\nprotein channels to move solute molecules from areas of\nhigher to lower concentration while active transport\nmechanisms are required to move solutes against\nconcentration gradients. Osmolarity is measured in units of\nmilliequivalents or milliosmoles, both of which take into\nconsideration the number of solute particles and the charge\non them. Fish that live in freshwater or saltwater adapt by\nbeing osmoregulators or osmoconformers.\n41.2 The Kidneys and\nOsmoregulatory Organs\nThe kidneys are the main osmoregulatory organs in\nmammalian systems; they function to filter blood and\nmaintain the osmolarity of body fluids at 300 mOsm. They\nare surrounded by three layers and are made up internally of\nthree distinct regions\u2014the cortex, medulla, and pelvis.\nThe blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the\nkidneys arise from and merge with the aorta and inferior\nvena cava, respectively. The renal arteries branch out from\nthe aorta and enter the kidney where they further divide into\nsegmental, interlobar, arcuate, and cortical radiate arteries.\nThe nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, which\nactively filters blood and generates urine. The nephron is\nmade up of the renal corpuscle and renal tubule. Cortical\nnephrons are found in the renal cortex, while juxtamedullary\nnephrons are found in the renal cortex close to the renal\nmedulla. The nephron filters and exchanges water and\nsolutes with two sets of blood vessels and the tissue fluid in\nthe kidneys.\nThere are three steps in the formation of urine: glomerular\nfiltration, which occurs in the glomerulus; tubular\nreabsorption, which occurs in the renal tubules; and tubular\nsecretion, which also occurs in the renal tubules.\n41.3 Excretion Systems\nMany systems have evolved for excreting wastes that are\nsimpler than the kidney and urinary systems of vertebrate\nanimals. The simplest system is that of contractile vacuoles\npresent in microorganisms. Flame cells and nephridia in\nworms perform excretory functions and maintain osmotic\nbalance. Some insects have evolved Malpighian tubules to\nexcrete wastes and maintain osmotic balance.\n41.4 Nitrogenous Wastes\nAmmonia is the waste produced by metabolism of nitrogen-\n1190\nChapter 41 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncontaining compounds like proteins and nucleic acids. While\naquatic animals can easily excrete ammonia into their\nwatery surroundings, terrestrial animals have evolved\nspecial mechanisms to eliminate the toxic ammonia from\ntheir systems. Urea is the major byproduct of ammonia\nmetabolism in vertebrate animals. Uric acid is the major\nbyproduct of ammonia metabolism in birds, terrestrial\narthropods, and reptiles.\n41.5 Hormonal Control of\nOsmoregulatory Functions\nHormonal cues help the kidneys synchronize the osmotic\nneeds of the body.

A host is the organism that is invaded and often\nharmed by a pathogen. Pathogens include bacteria, protists, fungi and other infectious organisms. We\nare constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water, on surfaces, and in the air. Mammalian immune\nsystems evolved for protection from such pathogens; they are composed of an extremely diverse array of\nspecialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of\nproviding protection from a majority of these disease agents.\nComponents of the immune system constantly search the body for signs of pathogens. When pathogens\nare found, immune factors are mobilized to the site of an infection. The immune factors identify the\nnature of the pathogen, strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat it efficiently, and\nthen halt the immune response after the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage. The\nimmune system can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more efficient\nresponse upon reexposure. This memory can last several decades. Features of the immune system, such\nas pathogen identification, specific response, amplification, retreat, and remembrance are essential for\nsurvival against pathogens. The immune response can be classified as either innate or active. The innate\nimmune response is always present and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing\non specific ones. Conversely, the adaptive immune response stores information about past infections\nand mounts pathogen-specific defenses.\nChapter Outline\n42.1 Innate Immune\nResponse\n42.2 Adaptive Immune\nResponse\n42.3 Antibodies\n42.4 Disruptions in the\nImmune System\n42.1 Innate Immune Response\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe physical and chemical immune barriers\n\u2022\nExplain immediate and induced innate immune responses\n\u2022\nDiscuss natural killer cells\n\u2022\nDescribe major histocompatibility class I molecules\n\u2022\nSummarize how the proteins in a complement system function to destroy extracellular\npathogens\nThe immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses. Innate immunity occurs\nnaturally because of genetic factors or physiology; it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to\nreduce the workload for the adaptive immune response. Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune\nresponse involve secreted proteins, receptor-mediated signaling, and intricate cell-to-cell communication.\nThe innate immune system developed early in animal evolution, roughly a billion years ago, as an essential\nresponse to infection. Innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets: any pathogenic threat\ntriggers a consistent sequence of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection\nindependently or mobilize a highly specialized adaptive immune response. For example, tears and mucus\nsecretions contain microbicidal factors.\nPhysical and Chemical Barriers\nBefore any immune factors are triggered, the skin functions as a continuous, impassable barrier to\npotentially infectious pathogens. Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation (drying out)\nand by the skin\u2019s acidity. In addition, beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with\ninvading pathogens, preventing infection. Regions of the body that are not protected by skin (such as the\neyes and mucus membranes) have alternative methods of defense, such as tears and mucus secretions that\ntrap and rinse away pathogens, and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push the mucus\nwith the pathogens out of the body. Throughout the body are other defenses, such as the low pH of the\nstomach (which inhibits the growth of pathogens), blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell\nmembranes, and the process of urination (which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract).\nDespite these barriers, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting\non mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the mucus or cilia. Some pathogens have evolved\nspecific mechanisms that allow them to overcome physical and chemical barriers. When pathogens do enter\nthe body, the innate immune system responds with inflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of\nimmune factors and proteins.\nPathogen Recognition\nAn infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the pathogen. All viruses infect cells and\nreplicate within those cells (intracellularly), whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate\nintracellularly or extracellularly, depending on the species. The innate immune system must respond\naccordingly: by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/or by identifying host cells that have already been\ninfected. When a pathogen enters the body, cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogen-\nassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the pathogen\u2019s surface. PAMPs are carbohydrate, polypeptide,\nand nucleic acid \u201csignatures\u201d that are expressed by viruses, bacteria, and parasites but which differ from\nmolecules on host cells. The immune system has specific cells, described in Figure 42.2 and shown in Figure\n42.3, with receptors that recognize these PAMPs. A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs\nforeign particles and pathogens. Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition\nreceptors (PRRs). PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the\nexternal environment. A monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and\ndifferentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue. Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures\nof pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a type of\nPRR that recognizes molecules that are shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules. TLRs\nare present in invertebrates as well as vertebrates, and appear to be one of the most ancient components of\n1194\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthe immune system. TLRs have also been identified in the mammalian nervous system.\nFigure 42.2 The characteristics and location of cells involved in the innate immune system are described.

Note the very\nsimilar morphologies of the leukocytes (1, 2, 3). (credit: modification of work by Bruce Wetzel, Harry Schaefer, NCI; scale-bar data from\nMatt Russell)\nCytokine Release Effect\nThe binding of PRRs with PAMPs triggers the release of cytokines, which signal that a pathogen is present and needs to be\ndestroyed along with any infected cells. A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation (form and\nfunction), proliferation (production), and gene expression to affect immune responses. At least 40 types of cytokines exist in\nhumans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them, the cell type that responds to them, and the changes they\nproduce. One type of cytokine, interferon, is illustrated in Figure 42.4.\nOne subclass of cytokines is the interleukin (IL), so named because they mediate interactions between leukocytes (white blood\ncells). Interleukins are involved in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition to being released from cells\nafter PAMP recognition, cytokines are released by the infected cells which bind to nearby uninfected cells and induce those cells\nto release cytokines, which results in a cytokine burst.\nA second class of early-acting cytokines is interferons, which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected\ncells. One of the functions of an interferon is to inhibit viral replication. They also have other important functions, such as\ntumor surveillance. Interferons work by signaling neighboring uninfected cells to destroy RNA and reduce protein synthesis,\nsignaling neighboring infected cells to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), and activating immune cells.\nIn response to interferons, uninfected cells alter their gene expression, which increases the cells\u2019 resistance to infection. One\neffect of interferon-induced gene expression is a sharply reduced cellular protein synthesis. Virally infected cells produce more\nviruses by synthesizing large quantities of viral proteins. Thus, by reducing protein synthesis, a cell becomes resistant to viral\ninfection.\n1196\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 42.4 Interferons are cytokines that are released by a cell infected with a virus. Response of neighboring cells to interferon helps\nstem the infection.\nPhagocytosis and Inflammation\nThe first cytokines to be produced are pro-inflammatory; that is, they encourage inflammation, the localized redness, swelling,\nheat, and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of\ninfection. The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen. Both\nmacrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis. A neutrophil is also a phagocytic\nleukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens. Neutrophils, shown in Figure 42.3, are the most abundant leukocytes of the\nimmune system. Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes, and they contain organelles, called lysosomes, that digest\nengulfed pathogens. An eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite; it is involved in the\nallergic response and in protection against helminthes (parasitic worms).\nNeutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi. A\nmast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules, such as histamine, in response to large pathogens. A basophil is\na leukocyte that, like a neutrophil, releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in Figure 42.5.\nBasophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of inflammatory responses.\nEosinophils and basophils produce additional inflammatory mediators to recruit more leukocytes. A hypersensitive immune\nresponse to harmless antigens, such as in pollen, often involves the release of histamine by basophils and mast cells.\nFigure 42.5 In response to a cut, mast cells secrete histamines that cause nearby capillaries to dilate. Neutrophils and monocytes leave the\ncapillaries. Monocytes mature into macrophages. Neutrophils, dendritic cells, and macrophages release chemicals to stimulate the\ninflammatory response. Neutrophils and macrophages also consume invading bacteria by phagocytosis.\nCytokines also send feedback to cells of the nervous system to bring about the overall symptoms of feeling sick, which include\n42.1 \u2022 Innate Immune Response\n1197\nlethargy, muscle pain, and nausea. These effects may have evolved because the symptoms encourage the individual to rest and\nprevent the spreading of the infection to others. Cytokines also increase the core body temperature, causing a fever, which\ncauses the liver to withhold iron from the blood. Without iron, certain pathogens, such as some bacteria, are unable to replicate;\nthis is called nutritional immunity.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this 23-second stop-motion video (http://openstax.org/l/conidia) showing a neutrophil that searches for and engulfs\nfungus spores during an elapsed time of about 79 minutes.\nNatural Killer Cells\nLymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large, darkly staining nuclei; they are small cells with\nvery little cytoplasm, as shown in Figure 42.6. Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer (NK) cells,\nlymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells (abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other\ntissue). T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes. T cells are lymphocytes that mature\nin the thymus gland, and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow. NK cells identify intracellular infections,\nespecially from viruses, by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class (MHC) I molecules on the surface of infected\ncells. MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells, thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets\nwhich are non-nucleated. The function of MHC I molecules is to display fragments of proteins from the infectious agents within\nthe cell to T cells; healthy cells will be ignored, while \u201cnon-self\u201d or foreign proteins will be attacked by the immune system. MHC\nII molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens (\u201cnon-self proteins\u201d) and on lymphocytes. MHC II molecules interact\nwith helper T cells to trigger the appropriate immune response, which may include the inflammatory response.\nFigure 42.6 Lymphocytes, such as NK cells, are characterized by their large nuclei that actively absorb Wright stain and therefore appear\ndark colored under a microscope.\nAn infected cell (or a tumor cell) is usually incapable of synthesizing and displaying MHC I molecules appropriately. The\nmetabolic resources of cells infected by some viruses produce proteins that interfere with MHC I processing and/or trafficking\nto the cell surface. The reduced MHC I on host cells varies from virus to virus and results from active inhibitors being produced\nby the viruses. This process can deplete host MHC I molecules on the cell surface, which NK cells detect as \u201cunhealthy\u201d or\n\u201cabnormal\u201d while searching for cellular MHC I molecules. Similarly, the dramatically altered gene expression of tumor cells\nleads to expression of extremely deformed or absent MHC I molecules that also signal \u201cunhealthy\u201d or \u201cabnormal.\u201d\nNK cells are always active; an interaction with normal, intact MHC I molecules on a healthy cell disables the killing sequence,\nand the NK cell moves on. After the NK cell detects an infected or tumor cell, its cytoplasm secretes granules comprised of\nperforin, a destructive protein that creates a pore in the target cell. Granzymes are released along with the perforin in the\nimmunological synapse. A granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo\nprogrammed cell death, or apoptosis. Phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind. NK cells are constantly patrolling\nthe body and are an effective mechanism for controlling potential infections and preventing cancer progression.\n1198\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nComplement\nAn array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins, called a complement system, functions to destroy extracellular\npathogens. Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously; these proteins are abundant in the\nblood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms. The complement system is so named\nbecause it is complementary to the antibody response of the adaptive immune system. Complement proteins bind to the\nsurfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are already bound by antibodies. Binding of\ncomplement proteins occurs in a specific and highly regulated sequence, with each successive protein being activated by\ncleavage and/or structural changes induced upon binding of the preceding protein(s). After the first few complement proteins\nbind, a cascade of sequential binding events follows in which the pathogen rapidly becomes coated in complement proteins.\nComplement proteins perform several functions. The proteins serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to\nphagocytic cells, such as macrophages and B cells, and enhance engulfment; this process is called opsonization. Certain\ncomplement proteins can combine to form attack complexes that open pores in microbial cell membranes. These structures\ndestroy pathogens by causing their contents to leak, as illustrated in Figure 42.7.\n42.1 \u2022 Innate Immune Response\n1199\nFigure 42.7 The classic pathway for the complement cascade involves the attachment of several initial complement proteins to an\nantibody-bound pathogen followed by rapid activation and binding of many more complement proteins and the creation of destructive\npores in the microbial cell envelope and cell wall. The alternate pathway does not involve antibody activation. Rather, C3 convertase\nspontaneously breaks down C3. Endogenous regulatory proteins prevent the complement complex from binding to host cells. Pathogens\nlacking these regulatory proteins are lysed.

Adaptive immunity is an immunity that\noccurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination. This part of the immune system is activated when\nthe innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection. In fact, without information from the innate immune\nsystem, the adaptive response could not be mobilized. There are two types of adaptive responses: the cell-mediated immune\nresponse, which is carried out by T cells, and the humoral immune response, which is controlled by activated B cells and\nantibodies. Activated T cells and B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the\ninvading pathogen. Their attack can kill pathogens directly or secrete antibodies that enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens\nand disrupt the infection. Adaptive immunity also involves a memory to provide the host with long-term protection from\nreinfection with the same type of pathogen; on reexposure, this memory will facilitate an efficient and quick response.\nAntigen-presenting Cells\nUnlike NK cells of the innate immune system, B cells (B lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that gives rise to antibodies,\nwhereas T cells (T lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in the immune response. T cells are a\nkey component in the cell-mediated response\u2014the specific immune response that utilizes T cells to neutralize cells that have\nbeen infected with viruses and certain bacteria. There are three types of T cells: cytotoxic, helper, and suppressor T cells.\nCytotoxic T cells destroy virus-infected cells in the cell-mediated immune response, and helper T cells play a part in activating\nboth the antibody and the cell-mediated immune responses. Suppressor T cells deactivate T cells and B cells when needed, and\nthus prevent the immune response from becoming too intense.\nAn antigen is a foreign or \u201cnon-self\u201d macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system. Not all antigens will provoke a\nresponse. For instance, individuals produce innumerable \u201cself\u201d antigens and are constantly exposed to harmless foreign\nantigens, such as food proteins, pollen, or dust components. The suppression of immune responses to harmless\nmacromolecules is highly regulated and typically prevents processes that could be damaging to the host, known as tolerance.\nThe innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens, and then inform the adaptive immune\nresponse about the presence of these antigens. An antigen-presenting cell (APC) is an immune cell that detects, engulfs, and\ninforms the adaptive immune response about an infection. When a pathogen is detected, these APCs will phagocytose the\npathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen. Antigen fragments will then be transported to the\nsurface of the APC, where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells. Dendritic cells are immune cells that process\nantigen material; they are present in the skin (Langerhans cells) and the lining of the nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines.\nSometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response, thus functioning as an antigen-\npresenting cell. Macrophages also function as APCs. Before activation and differentiation, B cells can also function as APCs.\nAfter phagocytosis by APCs, the phagocytic vesicle fuses with an intracellular lysosome forming phagolysosome. Within the\nphagolysosome, the components are broken down into fragments; the fragments are then loaded onto MHC class I or MHC\nclass II molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation, as illustrated in Figure 42.8. Note that T\nlymphocytes cannot properly respond to the antigen unless it is processed and embedded in an MHC II molecule. APCs express\nMHC on their surfaces, and when combined with a foreign antigen, these complexes signal a \u201cnon-self\u201d invader. Once the\nfragment of antigen is embedded in the MHC II molecule, the immune cell can respond. Helper T cells are one of the main\nlymphocytes that respond to antigen-presenting cells. Recall that all other nucleated cells of the body expressed MHC I\nmolecules, which signal \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cnormal.\u201d\n42.2 \u2022 Adaptive Immune Response\n1201\nFigure 42.8 An APC, such as a macrophage, engulfs and digests a foreign bacterium. An antigen from the bacterium is presented on the cell\nsurface in conjunction with an MHC II molecule. Lymphocytes of the adaptive immune response interact with antigen-embedded MHC II\nmolecules to mature into functional immune cells.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThis animation (http://openstax.org/l/immune_system) from Rockefeller University shows how dendritic cells act as sentinels in\nthe body's immune system.\nT and B Lymphocytes\nLymphocytes in human circulating blood are approximately 80 to 90 percent T cells, shown in Figure 42.9, and 10 to 20 percent B\ncells. Recall that the T cells are involved in the cell-mediated immune response, whereas B cells are part of the humoral immune\nresponse.\nT cells encompass a heterogeneous population of cells with extremely diverse functions. Some T cells respond to APCs of the\ninnate immune system, and indirectly induce immune responses by releasing cytokines. Other T cells stimulate B cells to\nprepare their own response. Another population of T cells detects APC signals and directly kills the infected cells. Other T cells\nare involved in suppressing inappropriate immune reactions to harmless or \u201cself\u201d antigens.\nFigure 42.9 This scanning electron micrograph shows a T lymphocyte, which is responsible for the cell-mediated immune response. T cells\nare able to recognize antigens. (credit: modification of work by NCI; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nT and B cells exhibit a common theme of recognition/binding of specific antigens via a complementary receptor, followed by\nactivation and self-amplification/maturation to specifically bind to the particular antigen of the infecting pathogen. T and B\nlymphocytes are also similar in that each cell only expresses one type of antigen receptor. Any individual may possess a\n1202\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\npopulation of T and B cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing\nvirtually any infecting pathogen. T and B cells are activated when they recognize small components of antigens, called epitopes,\npresented by APCs, illustrated in Figure 42.10. Note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire\nantigen; for this reason, epitopes are known as \u201cantigenic determinants.\u201d In the absence of information from APCs, T and B cells\nremain inactive, or na\u00efve, and are unable to prepare an immune response. The requirement for information from the APCs of\ninnate immunity to trigger B cell or T cell activation illustrates the essential nature of the innate immune response to the\nfunctioning of the entire immune system.\nFigure 42.10 An antigen is a macromolecule that reacts with components of the immune system. A given antigen may contain several\nmotifs that are recognized by immune cells. Each motif is an epitope. In this figure, the entire structure is an antigen, and the orange,\nsalmon and green components projecting from it represent potential epitopes.\nNa\u00efve T cells can express one of two different molecules, CD4 or CD8, on their surface, as shown in Figure 42.11, and are\naccordingly classified as CD4+ or CD8+ cells. These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will interact with\nand respond to an APC. Na\u00efve CD4+ cells bind APCs via their antigen-embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to\nbecome helper T (TH) lymphocytes, cells that go on to stimulate B cells (or cytotoxic T cells) directly or secrete cytokines to\ninform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat. In contrast, CD8+ cells engage antigen-embedded MHC I\nmolecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis\nand emit cytokines to amplify the immune response. The two populations of T cells have different mechanisms of immune\nprotection, but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell receptors (TCRs). The CD4 or CD8 surface\nmolecules differentiate whether the TCR will engage an MHC II or an MHC I molecule. Because they assist in binding\nspecificity, the CD4 and CD8 molecules are described as coreceptors.\n42.2 \u2022 Adaptive Immune Response\n1203\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 42.11 Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells engage MHC II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and become activated. Clones of the\nactivated helper T cell, in turn, activate B cells and CD8+ T cells, which become cytotoxic T cells. Cytotoxic T cells kill infected cells.\nWhich of the following statements about T cells is false?\na.\nHelper T cells release cytokines while cytotoxic T cells kill the infected cell.\nb.\nHelper T cells are CD4+, while cytotoxic T cells are CD8+.\nc.\nMHC II is a receptor found on most body cells, while MHC I is a receptor found on immune cells only.\nd.\nThe T cell receptor is found on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.\nConsider the innumerable possible antigens that an individual will be exposed to during a lifetime. The mammalian adaptive\nimmune system is adept in responding appropriately to each antigen. Mammals have an enormous diversity of T cell\npopulations, resulting from the diversity of TCRs. Each TCR consists of two polypeptide chains that span the T cell membrane,\nas illustrated in Figure 42.12; the chains are linked by a disulfide bridge. Each polypeptide chain is comprised of a constant\ndomain and a variable domain: a domain, in this sense, is a specific region of a protein that may be regulatory or structural. The\nintracellular domain is involved in intracellular signaling. A single T cell will express thousands of identical copies of one specific\nTCR variant on its cell surface. The specificity of the adaptive immune system occurs because it synthesizes millions of different\nT cell populations, each expressing a TCR that differs in its variable domain. This TCR diversity is achieved by the mutation and\nrecombination of genes that encode these receptors in stem cell precursors of T cells. The binding between an antigen-\ndisplaying MHC molecule and a complementary TCR \u201cmatch\u201d indicates that the adaptive immune system needs to activate and\nproduce that specific T cell because its structure is appropriate to recognize and destroy the invading pathogen.\n1204\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 42.12 A T cell receptor spans the membrane and projects variable binding regions into the extracellular space to bind processed\nantigens via MHC molecules on APCs.\nHelper T Lymphocytes\nThe TH lymphocytes function indirectly to identify potential pathogens for other cells of the immune system. These cells are\nimportant for extracellular infections, such as those caused by certain bacteria, helminths, and protozoa. THlymphocytes\nrecognize specific antigens displayed in the MHC II complexes of APCs. There are two major populations of TH cells: TH1 and\nTH2. TH1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of macrophages and other T cells. TH1 cells activate the action of\ncyotoxic T cells, as well as macrophages. TH2 cells stimulate na\u00efve B cells to destroy foreign invaders via antibody secretion.\nWhether a TH1 or a TH2 immune response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells of the innate\nimmune system, which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen.\nThe TH1-mediated response involves macrophages and is associated with inflammation. Recall the frontline defenses of\nmacrophages involved in the innate immune response. Some intracellular bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have\nevolved to multiply in macrophages after they have been engulfed. These pathogens evade attempts by macrophages to destroy\nand digest the pathogen. When M. tuberculosis infection occurs, macrophages can stimulate na\u00efve T cells to become TH1 cells.\nThese stimulated T cells secrete specific cytokines that send feedback to the macrophage to stimulate its digestive capabilities\nand allow it to destroy the colonizing M. tuberculosis. In the same manner, TH1-activated macrophages also become better\nsuited to ingest and kill tumor cells. In summary; TH1 responses are directed toward intracellular invaders while TH2 responses\nare aimed at those that are extracellular.\nB Lymphocytes\nWhen stimulated by the TH2 pathway, na\u00efve B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. A plasma cell is an\nimmune cell that secrets antibodies; these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens. Similar to T cells, na\u00efve B\ncells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors (BCRs), which are membrane-bound forms of Ig (immunoglobulin, or\nan antibody). The B cell receptor has two heavy chains and two light chains connected by disulfide linkages. Each chain has a\nconstant and a variable region; the latter is involved in antigen binding. Two other membrane proteins, Ig alpha and Ig beta, are\ninvolved in signaling. The receptors of any particular B cell, as shown in Figure 42.13 are all the same, but the hundreds of\nmillions of different B cells in an individual have distinct recognition domains that contribute to extensive diversity in the types\nof molecular structures to which they can bind. In this state, B cells function as APCs. They bind and engulf foreign antigens via\ntheir BCRs and then display processed antigens in the context of MHC II molecules to TH2 cells. When a TH2 cell detects that a B\ncell is bound to a relevant antigen, it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly, which makes\nthousands of identical (clonal) copies of it, and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition\npattern as the BCRs. The activation of B cells corresponding to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that\nvariant is known as clonal selection. This phenomenon drastically, but briefly, changes the proportions of BCR variants\nexpressed by the immune system, and shifts the balance toward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen.\n42.2 \u2022 Adaptive Immune Response\n1205\nFigure 42.13 B cell receptors are embedded in the membranes of B cells and bind a variety of antigens through their variable regions. The\nsignal transduction region transfers the signal into the cell.\nT and B cells differ in one fundamental way: whereas T cells bind antigens that have been digested and embedded in MHC\nmolecules by APCs, B cells function as APCs that bind intact antigens that have not been processed. Although T and B cells both\nreact with molecules that are termed \u201cantigens,\u201d these lymphocytes actually respond to very different types of molecules. B cells\nmust be able to bind intact antigens because they secrete antibodies that must recognize the pathogen directly, rather than\ndigested remnants of the pathogen. Bacterial carbohydrate and lipid molecules can activate B cells independently from the T\ncells.\nCytotoxic T Lymphocytes\nCTLs, a subclass of T cells, function to clear infections directly. The cell-mediated part of the adaptive immune system consists\nof CTLs that attack and destroy infected cells. CTLs are particularly important in protecting against viral infections; this is\nbecause viruses replicate within cells where they are shielded from extracellular contact with circulating antibodies. When APCs\nphagocytize pathogens and present MHC I-embedded antigens to na\u00efve CD8+ T cells that express complementary TCRs, the\nCD8+ T cells become activated to proliferate according to clonal selection. These resulting CTLs then identify non-APCs\ndisplaying the same MHC I-embedded antigens (for example, viral proteins)\u2014for example, the CTLs identify infected host cells.\nIntracellularly, infected cells typically die after the infecting pathogen replicates to a sufficient concentration and lyses the cell,\nas many viruses do. CTLs attempt to identify and destroy infected cells before the pathogen can replicate and escape, thereby\nhalting the progression of intracellular infections. CTLs also support NK lymphocytes to destroy early cancers. Cytokines\nsecreted by the TH1 response that stimulates macrophages also stimulate CTLs and enhance their ability to identify and destroy\ninfected cells and tumors.\nCTLs sense MHC I-embedded antigens by directly interacting with infected cells via their TCRs. Binding of TCRs with antigens\nactivates CTLs to release perforin and granzyme, degradative enzymes that will induce apoptosis of the infected cell. Recall that\nthis is a similar destruction mechanism to that used by NK cells. In this process, the CTL does not become infected and is not\nharmed by the secretion of perforin and granzymes. In fact, the functions of NK cells and CTLs are complementary and\nmaximize the removal of infected cells, as illustrated in Figure 42.14. If the NK cell cannot identify the \u201cmissing self\u201d pattern of\ndown-regulated MHC I molecules, then the CTL can identify it by the complex of MHC I with foreign antigens, which signals\n\u201caltered self.\u201d Similarly, if the CTL cannot detect antigen-embedded MHC I because the receptors are depleted from the cell\nsurface, NK cells will destroy the cell instead. CTLs also emit cytokines, such as interferons, that alter surface protein expression\nin other infected cells, such that the infected cells can be easily identified and destroyed. Moreover, these interferons can also\nprevent virally infected cells from releasing virus particles.\n1206\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 42.14 Natural killer (NK) cells recognize the MHC I receptor on healthy cells. If MHC I is absent, the cell is lysed.\nBased on what you know about MHC receptors, why do you think an organ transplanted from an incompatible donor to a\nrecipient will be rejected?\nPlasma cells and CTLs are collectively called effector cells: they represent differentiated versions of their na\u00efve counterparts, and\nthey are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host cells.\nMucosal Surfaces and Immune Tolerance\nThe innate and adaptive immune responses discussed thus far comprise the systemic immune system (affecting the whole\nbody), which is distinct from the mucosal immune system. Mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue,\nwhich functions independently of the systemic immune system, and which has its own innate and adaptive components.\nMucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), illustrated in Figure 42.15, is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with\nepithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body. This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of\nthe body with direct contact to the external environment. The systemic and mucosal immune systems use many of the same cell\ntypes. Foreign particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells called M cells and delivered to\nAPCs located directly below the mucosal tissue. M cells function in the transport described, and are located in the Peyer\u2019s patch,\na lymphoid nodule. APCs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells, with B cells and macrophages having\nminor roles. Processed antigens displayed on APCs are detected by T cells in the MALT and at various mucosal induction sites,\nsuch as the tonsils, adenoids, appendix, or the mesenteric lymph nodes of the intestine. Activated T cells then migrate through\nthe lymphatic system and into the circulatory system to mucosal sites of infection.\n42.2 \u2022 Adaptive Immune Response\n1207\nFigure 42.15 The topology and function of intestinal MALT is shown. Pathogens are taken up by M cells in the intestinal epithelium and\nexcreted into a pocket formed by the inner surface of the cell. The pocket contains antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, which\nengulf the antigens, then present them with MHC II molecules on the cell surface. The dendritic cells migrate to an underlying tissue called\na Peyer\u2019s patch. Antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and B cells aggregate within the Peyer\u2019s patch, forming organized lymphoid follicles.\nThere, some T cells and B cells are activated. Other antigen-loaded dendritic cells migrate through the lymphatic system where they\nactivate B cells, T cells, and plasma cells in the lymph nodes. The activated cells then return to MALT tissue effector sites. IgA and other\nantibodies are secreted into the intestinal lumen.\nMALT is a crucial component of a functional immune system because mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal passages, are the first\ntissues onto which inhaled or ingested pathogens are deposited. The mucosal tissue includes the mouth, pharynx, and\nesophagus, and the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts.\nThe immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful, unnecessary responses to harmless substances, and more\nimportantly so that it does not attack \u201cself.\u201d The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a\ndetected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance. Immune tolerance is crucial for\nmaintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances (such as food proteins) that APCs of the\noral cavity, pharynx, and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter. Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs in the\nliver, lymph nodes, small intestine, and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of regulatory\nT (Treg) cells, specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors.\nThe combined result of Treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and\nto allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead. In addition to promoting immune tolerance of harmless antigens,\nother subsets of Treg cells are involved in the prevention of the autoimmune response, which is an inappropriate immune\nresponse to host cells or self-antigens. Another Treg class suppresses immune responses to harmful pathogens after the infection\n1208\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nhas cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis.\nImmunological Memory\nThe adaptive immune system possesses a memory component that allows for an efficient and dramatic response upon\nreinvasion of the same pathogen. Memory is handled by the adaptive immune system with little reliance on cues from the innate\nresponse. During the adaptive immune response to a pathogen that has not been encountered before, called a primary response,\nplasma cells secreting antibodies and differentiated T cells increase, then plateau over time. As B and T cells mature into effector\ncells, a subset of the na\u00efve populations differentiates into B and T memory cells with the same antigen specificities, as illustrated\nin Figure 42.16.\nA memory cell is an antigen-specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary\nimmune response, but that can immediately become effector cells upon reexposure to the same pathogen. During the primary\nimmune response, memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses. As the infection is cleared\nand pathogenic stimuli subside, the effectors are no longer needed, and they undergo apoptosis. In contrast, the memory cells\npersist in the circulation.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 42.16 After initially binding an antigen to the B cell receptor (BCR), a B cell internalizes the antigen and presents it on MHC II. A\nhelper T cell recognizes the MHC II\u2013antigen complex and activates the B cell. As a result, memory B cells and plasma cells are made.\nThe Rh antigen is found on Rh-positive red blood cells. An Rh-negative female can usually carry an Rh-positive fetus to term\nwithout difficulty. However, if she has a second Rh-positive fetus, her body may launch an immune attack that causes hemolytic\n42.2 \u2022 Adaptive Immune Response\n1209\ndisease of the newborn. Why do you think hemolytic disease is only a problem during the second or subsequent pregnancies?\nIf the pathogen is never encountered again during the individual\u2019s lifetime, B and T memory cells will circulate for a few years or\neven several decades and will gradually die off, having never functioned as effector cells. However, if the host is reexposed to the\nsame pathogen type, circulating memory cells will immediately differentiate into plasma cells and CTLs without input from\nAPCs or TH cells. One reason the adaptive immune response is delayed is because it takes time for na\u00efve B and T cells with the\nappropriate antigen specificities to be identified and activated. Upon reinfection, this step is skipped, and the result is a more\nrapid production of immune defenses. Memory B cells that differentiate into plasma cells output tens to hundreds-fold greater\nantibody amounts than were secreted during the primary response, as the graph in Figure 42.17 illustrates. This rapid and\ndramatic antibody response may stop the infection before it can even become established, and the individual may not realize he\nor she had been exposed.\nFigure 42.17 In the primary response to infection, antibodies are secreted first from plasma cells. Upon reexposure to the same pathogen,\nmemory cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells that output a greater amount of antibody for a longer period of time.\nVaccination is based on the knowledge that exposure to noninfectious antigens, derived from known pathogens, generates a\nmild primary immune response. The immune response to vaccination may not be perceived by the host as illness but still confers\nimmune memory. When exposed to the corresponding pathogen to which an individual was vaccinated, the reaction is similar\nto a secondary exposure. Because each reinfection generates more memory cells and increased resistance to the pathogen, and\nbecause some memory cells die, certain vaccine courses involve one or more booster vaccinations to mimic repeat exposures: for\ninstance, tetanus boosters are necessary every ten years because the memory cells only live that long.\nMucosal Immune Memory\nA subset of T and B cells of the mucosal immune system differentiates into memory cells just as in the systemic immune system.\nUpon reinvasion of the same pathogen type, a pronounced immune response occurs at the mucosal site where the original\npathogen deposited, but a collective defense is also organized within interconnected or adjacent mucosal tissue. For instance,\nthe immune memory of an infection in the oral cavity would also elicit a response in the pharynx if the oral cavity was exposed to\nthe same pathogen.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nVaccinologist\nVaccination (or immunization) involves the delivery, usually by injection as shown in Figure 42.18, of noninfectious antigen(s)\nderived from known pathogens. Other components, called adjuvants, are delivered in parallel to help stimulate the immune\nresponse. Immunological memory is the reason vaccines work. Ideally, the effect of vaccination is to elicit immunological\nmemory, and thus resistance to specific pathogens without the individual having to experience an infection.\n1210\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 42.18 Vaccines are often delivered by injection into the arm. (credit: U.S. Navy Photographer's Mate Airman Apprentice Christopher\nD. Blachly)\nVaccinologists are involved in the process of vaccine development from the initial idea to the availability of the completed\nvaccine. This process can take decades, can cost millions of dollars, and can involve many obstacles along the way. For instance,\ninjected vaccines stimulate the systemic immune system, eliciting humoral and cell-mediated immunity, but have little effect on\nthe mucosal response, which presents a challenge because many pathogens are deposited and replicate in mucosal\ncompartments, and the injection does not provide the most efficient immune memory for these disease agents. For this reason,\nvaccinologists are actively involved in developing new vaccines that are applied via intranasal, aerosol, oral, or transcutaneous\n(absorbed through the skin) delivery methods. Importantly, mucosal-administered vaccines elicit both mucosal and systemic\nimmunity and produce the same level of disease resistance as injected vaccines.\nFigure 42.19 The polio vaccine can be administered orally. (credit: modification of work by UNICEF Sverige)\nCurrently, a version of intranasal influenza vaccine is available, and the polio and typhoid vaccines can be administered orally, as\nshown in Figure 42.19. Similarly, the measles and rubella vaccines are being adapted to aerosol delivery using inhalation devices.\nEventually, transgenic plants may be engineered to produce vaccine antigens that can be eaten to confer disease resistance.\nOther vaccines may be adapted to rectal or vaginal application to elicit immune responses in rectal, genitourinary, or\nreproductive mucosa. Finally, vaccine antigens may be adapted to transdermal application in which the skin is lightly scraped\nand microneedles are used to pierce the outermost layer. In addition to mobilizing the mucosal immune response, this new\ngeneration of vaccines may end the anxiety associated with injections and, in turn, improve patient participation.\n42.2 \u2022 Adaptive Immune Response\n1211\nPrimary Centers of the Immune System\nAlthough the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, maturation, and\nintercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites. The blood circulates immune cells, proteins, and other factors\nthrough the body. Approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes, which encompass monocytes (the precursor\nof macrophages) and lymphocytes. The majority of cells in the blood are erythrocytes (red blood cells). Lymph is a watery fluid\nthat bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain erythrocytes. Cells of the immune system\ncan travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial space, by a process\ncalled extravasation (passing through to surrounding tissue).\nThe cells of the immune system originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Cytokines stimulate these stem\ncells to differentiate into immune cells. B cell maturation occurs in the bone marrow, whereas na\u00efve T cells transit from the bone\nmarrow to the thymus for maturation. In the thymus, immature T cells that express TCRs complementary to self-antigens are\ndestroyed. This process helps prevent autoimmune responses.\nOn maturation, T and B lymphocytes circulate to various destinations. Lymph nodes scattered throughout the body, as\nillustrated in Figure 42.20, house large populations of T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Lymph gathers antigens\nas it drains from tissues. These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned to circulation. APCs\nin the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential pathogens.\nFigure 42.20 (a) Lymphatic vessels carry a clear fluid called lymph throughout the body. The liquid enters (b) lymph nodes through afferent\nvessels. Lymph nodes are filled with lymphocytes that purge infecting cells. The lymph then exits through efferent vessels. (credit:\nmodification of work by NIH, NCI)\nThe spleen houses B and T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells. The spleen, shown in Figure 42.21, is the site where\nAPCs that have trapped foreign particles in the blood can communicate with lymphocytes. Antibodies are synthesized and\nsecreted by activated plasma cells in the spleen, and the spleen filters foreign substances and antibody-complexed pathogens\nfrom the blood. Functionally, the spleen is to the blood as lymph nodes are to the lymph.\n1212\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 42.21 The spleen is similar to a lymph node but is much larger and filters blood instead of lymph. Blood enters the spleen through\narteries and exits through veins. The spleen contains two types of tissue: red pulp and white pulp. Red pulp consists of cavities that store\nblood. Within the red pulp, damaged red blood cells are removed and replaced by new ones. White pulp is rich in lymphocytes that remove\nantigen-coated bacteria from the blood. (credit: modification of work by NCI)\n42.3 Antibodies\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain cross-reactivity\n\u2022\nDescribe the structure and function of antibodies\n\u2022\nDiscuss antibody production\nAn antibody, also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an\nantigen. Antibodies are the functional basis of humoral immunity. Antibodies occur in the blood, in gastric and mucus\nsecretions, and in breast milk. Antibodies in these bodily fluids can bind pathogens and mark them for destruction by\nphagocytes before they can infect cells.\nAntibody Structure\nAn antibody molecule is comprised of four polypeptides: two identical heavy chains (large peptide units) that are partially bound\nto each other in a \u201cY\u201d formation, which are flanked by two identical light chains (small peptide units), as illustrated in Figure\n42.22. Bonds between the cysteine amino acids in the antibody molecule attach the polypeptides to each other. The areas where\nthe antigen is recognized on the antibody are variable domains and the antibody base is composed of constant domains.\nIn germ-line B cells, the variable region of the light chain gene has 40 variable (V) and five joining (J) segments. An enzyme called\nDNA recombinase randomly excises most of these segments out of the gene, and splices one V segment to one J segment.\nDuring RNA processing, all but one V and J segment are spliced out. Recombination and splicing may result in over 106 possible\nVJ combinations. As a result, each differentiated B cell in the human body typically has a unique variable chain. The constant\ndomain, which does not bind antibody, is the same for all antibodies.\n42.3 \u2022 Antibodies\n1213\nFigure 42.22 (a) As a germ-line B cell matures, an enzyme called DNA recombinase randomly excises V and J segments from the light chain\ngene. Splicing at the mRNA level results in further gene rearrangement. As a result, (b) each antibody has a unique variable region capable\nof binding a different antigen.\nSimilar to TCRs and BCRs, antibody diversity is produced by the mutation and recombination of approximately 300 different\ngene segments encoding the light and heavy chain variable domains in precursor cells that are destined to become B cells. The\nvariable domains from the heavy and light chains interact to form the binding site through which an antibody can bind a\nspecific epitope on an antigen. The numbers of repeated constant domains in Ig classes are the same for all antibodies\ncorresponding to a specific class. Antibodies are structurally similar to the extracellular component of the BCRs, and B cell\nmaturation to plasma cells can be visualized in simple terms as the cell acquires the ability to secrete the extracellular portion of\nits BCR in large quantities.\nAntibody Classes\nAntibodies can be divided into five classes\u2014IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE\u2014based on their physiochemical, structural, and\nimmunological properties. IgGs, which make up about 80 percent of all antibodies, have heavy chains that consist of one\nvariable domain and three identical constant domains. IgA and IgD also have three constant domains per heavy chain, whereas\nIgM and IgE each have four constant domains per heavy chain. The variable domain determines binding specificity and the\nconstant domain of the heavy chain determines the immunological mechanism of action of the corresponding antibody class. It\nis possible for two antibodies to have the same binding specificities but be in different classes and, therefore, to be involved in\n1214\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ndifferent functions.\nAfter an adaptive defense is produced against a pathogen, typically plasma cells first secrete IgM into the blood. BCRs on na\u00efve B\ncells are of the IgM class and occasionally IgD class. IgM molecules make up approximately ten percent of all antibodies. Prior to\nantibody secretion, plasma cells assemble IgM molecules into pentamers (five individual antibodies) linked by a joining (J)\nchain, as shown in Figure 42.23. The pentamer arrangement means that these macromolecules can bind ten identical antigens.\nHowever, IgM molecules released early in the adaptive immune response do not bind to antigens as stably as IgGs, which are\none of the possible types of antibodies secreted in large quantities upon reexposure to the same pathogen. Figure 42.23\nsummarizes the properties of immunoglobulins and illustrates their basic structures.\nFigure 42.23 Immunoglobulins have different functions, but all are composed of light and heavy chains that form a Y-shaped structure.\nIgAs populate the saliva, tears, breast milk, and mucus secretions of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts.\nCollectively, these bodily fluids coat and protect the extensive mucosa (4000 square feet in humans). The total number of IgA\nmolecules in these bodily secretions is greater than the number of IgG molecules in the blood serum. A small amount of IgA is\nalso secreted into the serum in monomeric form. Conversely, some IgM is secreted into bodily fluids of the mucosa. Similar to\nIgM, IgA molecules are secreted as polymeric structures linked with a J chain. However, IgAs are secreted mostly as dimeric\nmolecules, not pentamers.\nIgE is present in the serum in small quantities and is best characterized in its role as an allergy mediator. IgD is also present in\nsmall quantities. Similar to IgM, BCRs of the IgD class are found on the surface of na\u00efve B cells. This class supports antigen\nrecognition and maturation of B cells to plasma cells.\nAntibody Functions\nDifferentiated plasma cells are crucial players in the humoral response, and the antibodies they secrete are particularly\nsignificant against extracellular pathogens and toxins. Antibodies circulate freely and act independently of plasma cells.\nAntibodies can be transferred from one individual to another to temporarily protect against infectious disease. For instance, a\nperson who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a\nnonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor\u2019s blood serum. This phenomenon is\ncalled passive immunity; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding, which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to\ninfections during the first few months of life.\nAntibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them, as illustrated in Figure 42.24, by blocking key sites on the pathogen\nthat enhance their infectivity (such as receptors that \u201cdock\u201d pathogens on host cells). Antibody neutralization can prevent\npathogens from entering and infecting host cells, as opposed to the CTL-mediated approach of killing cells that are already\ninfected to prevent progression of an established infection. The neutralized antibody-coated pathogens can then be filtered by\nthe spleen and eliminated in urine or feces.\n42.3 \u2022 Antibodies\n1215\nFigure 42.24 Antibodies may inhibit infection by (a) preventing the antigen from binding its target, (b) tagging a pathogen for destruction by\nmacrophages or neutrophils, or (c) activating the complement cascade.\nAntibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages or neutrophils, because phagocytic\ncells are highly attracted to macromolecules complexed with antibodies. Phagocytic enhancement by antibodies is called\nopsonization. In a process called complement fixation, IgM and IgG in serum bind to antigens and provide docking sites onto\nwhich sequential complement proteins can bind. The combination of antibodies and complement enhances opsonization even\nfurther and promotes rapid clearing of pathogens.\nAffinity, Avidity, and Cross Reactivity\nNot all antibodies bind with the same strength, specificity, and stability. In fact, antibodies exhibit different affinities\n(attraction) depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules, as illustrated in Figure\n42.25. An antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and stably, and thus would be\nexpected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen corresponding to the specific antigen.\n1216\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 42.25 (a) Affinity refers to the strength of single interaction between antigen and antibody, while avidity refers to the strength of all\ninteractions combined. (b) An antibody may cross react with different epitopes.\nThe term avidity describes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined, multivalent structures (such as IgM and IgA).\nAlthough avidity measures the strength of binding, just as affinity does, the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the\nantibodies in a multimeric structure. The avidity depends on the number of identical binding sites on the antigen being\ndetected, as well as other physical and chemical factors. Typically, multimeric antibodies, such as pentameric IgM, are classified\nas having lower affinity than monomeric antibodies, but high avidity. Essentially, the fact that multimeric antibodies can bind\nmany antigens simultaneously balances their slightly lower binding strength for each antibody/antigen interaction.\nAntibodies secreted after binding to one epitope on an antigen may exhibit cross reactivity for the same or similar epitopes on\ndifferent antigens. Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region (the surface area of about four to six amino acids), it is\npossible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short regions. Cross\nreactivity describes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion, but to a different\nantigen.\nCross reactivity can be beneficial if an individual develops immunity to several related pathogens despite having only been\nexposed to or vaccinated against one of them. For instance, antibody cross reactivity may occur against the similar surface\nstructures of various Gram-negative bacteria. Conversely, antibodies raised against pathogenic molecular components that\nresemble self molecules may incorrectly mark host cells for destruction and cause autoimmune damage. Patients who develop\nsystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly exhibit antibodies that react with their own DNA. These antibodies may have\nbeen initially raised against the nucleic acid of microorganisms but later cross-reacted with self-antigens. This phenomenon is\nalso called molecular mimicry.\n42.3 \u2022 Antibodies\n1217\nAntibodies of the Mucosal Immune System\nAntibodies synthesized by the mucosal immune system include IgA and IgM. Activated B cells differentiate into mucosal plasma\ncells that synthesize and secrete dimeric IgA, and to a lesser extent, pentameric IgM. Secreted IgA is abundant in tears, saliva,\nbreast milk, and in secretions of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Antibody secretion results in a local humoral\nresponse at epithelial surfaces and prevents infection of the mucosa by binding and neutralizing pathogens.\n42.4 Disruptions in the Immune System\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe hypersensitivity\n\u2022\nDefine autoimmunity\nA functioning immune system is essential for survival, but even the sophisticated cellular and molecular defenses of the\nmammalian immune response can be defeated by pathogens at virtually every step. In the competition between immune\nprotection and pathogen evasion, pathogens have the advantage of more rapid evolution because of their shorter generation\ntime and other characteristics. For instance, Streptococcus pneumoniae (bacterium that cause pneumonia and meningitis)\nsurrounds itself with a capsule that inhibits phagocytes from engulfing it and displaying antigens to the adaptive immune\nsystem. Staphylococcus aureus (bacterium that can cause skin infections, abscesses, and meningitis) synthesizes a toxin called\nleukocidin that kills phagocytes after they engulf the bacterium. Other pathogens can also hinder the adaptive immune system.\nHIV infects TH cells via their CD4 surface molecules, gradually depleting the number of TH cells in the body; this inhibits the\nadaptive immune system\u2019s capacity to generate sufficient responses to infection or tumors. As a result, HIV-infected individuals\noften suffer from infections that would not cause illness in people with healthy immune systems but which can cause\ndevastating illness to immune-compromised individuals. Maladaptive responses of immune cells and molecules themselves can\nalso disrupt the proper functioning of the entire system, leading to host cell damage that could become fatal.\nImmunodeficiency\nFailures, insufficiencies, or delays at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and\nreplicate or proliferate to high enough levels that the immune system becomes overwhelmed. Immunodeficiency is the failure,\ninsufficiency, or delay in the response of the immune system, which may be acquired or inherited. Immunodeficiency can be\nacquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens (such as HIV), chemical exposure (including certain medical\ntreatments), malnutrition, or possibly by extreme stress. For instance, radiation exposure can destroy populations of\nlymphocytes and elevate an individual\u2019s susceptibility to infections and cancer. Dozens of genetic disorders result in\nimmunodeficiencies, including Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), Bare lymphocyte syndrome, and MHC II\ndeficiencies. Rarely, primary immunodeficiencies that are present from birth may occur. Neutropenia is one form in which the\nimmune system produces a below-average number of neutrophils, the body\u2019s most abundant phagocytes. As a result, bacterial\ninfections may go unrestricted in the blood, causing serious complications.\nHypersensitivities\nMaladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization are\ntermed hypersensitivities. The types of hypersensitivities include immediate, delayed, and autoimmunity. A large proportion of\nthe population is affected by one or more types of hypersensitivity.\nAllergies\nThe immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs\nwithin minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy. In the United States, 20 percent of the population exhibits\nsymptoms of allergy or asthma, whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens. Upon initial exposure to a\npotential allergen, an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the IgE class via the typical process of APCs presenting\nprocessed antigen to TH cells that stimulate B cells to produce IgE. This class of antibodies also mediates the immune response\nto parasitic worms. The constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues. This\nprocess primes, or sensitizes, the tissue. Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, IgE molecules on mast cells bind the\nantigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino acids histamine and serotonin;\nthese chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses. Figure 42.26 shows an example of an\nallergic response to ragweed pollen. The effects of an allergic reaction range from mild symptoms like sneezing and itchy, watery\neyes to more severe or even life-threatening reactions involving intensely itchy welts or hives, airway contraction with severe\n1218\nChapter 42 \u2022 The Immune System\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nrespiratory distress, and plummeting blood pressure. This extreme reaction is known as anaphylactic shock. If not treated with\nepinephrine to counter the blood pressure and breathing effects, this condition can be fatal.\nFigure 42.26 On first exposure to an allergen, an IgE antibody is synthesized by plasma cells in response to a harmless antigen. The IgE\nmolecules bind to mast cells, and on secondary exposure, the mast cells release histamines and other modulators that affect the\nsymptoms of allergy. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nDelayed hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immune response that takes approximately one to two days after secondary exposure\nfor a maximal reaction to be observed. This type of hypersensitivity involves the TH1 cytokine-mediated inflammatory response\nand may manifest as local tissue lesions or contact dermatitis (rash or skin irritation). Delayed hypersensitivity occurs in some\nindividuals in response to contact with certain types of jewelry or cosmetics. Delayed hypersensitivity facilitates the immune\nresponse to poison ivy and is also the reason why the skin test for tuberculosis results in a small region of inflammation on\nindividuals who were previously exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. That is also why cortisone is used to treat such\nresponses: it will inhibit cytokine production.\nAutoimmunity\nAutoimmunity is a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the population. Most types\nof autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response. Antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as foreign are\ntermed autoantibodies. In patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, muscle cell receptors that induce\ncontraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies. The result is muscle weakness that may include marked\ndifficultly with fine and/or gross motor functions. In systemic lupus erythematosus, a diffuse autoantibody response to the\nindividual\u2019s own DNA and proteins results in various systemic diseases. As illustrated in Figure 42.27, systemic lupus\nerythematosus may affect the heart, joints, lungs, skin, kidneys, central nervous system, or other tissues, causing tissue damage\nvia antibody binding, complement recruitment, lysis, and inflammation.\n42.4 \u2022 Disruptions in the Immune System\n1219\nFigure 42.27 Systemic lupus erythematosus is characterized by autoimmunity to the individual\u2019s own DNA and/or proteins, which leads to\nvaried dysfunction of the organs. (credit: modification of work by Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m)\nAutoimmunity can develop with time, and its causes may be rooted in molecular mimicry. Antibodies and TCRs may bind self\nantigens that are structurally similar to pathogen antigens, which the immune receptors first raised. As an example, infection\nwith Streptococcus pyogenes (bacterium that causes strep throat) may generate antibodies or T cells that react with heart\nmuscle, which has a similar structure to the surface of S. pyogenes. These antibodies can damage heart muscle with\nautoimmune attacks, leading to rheumatic fever. Insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes mellitus arises from a destructive\ninflammatory TH1 response against insulin-producing cells of the pancreas.

Using a combination of cellular and\nmolecular attacks, the innate immune system identifies the\nnature of a pathogen and responds with inflammation,\nphagocytosis, cytokine release, destruction by NK cells, and/\nor a complement system. When innate mechanisms are\ninsufficient to clear an infection, the adaptive immune\nresponse is informed and mobilized.\n42.2 Adaptive Immune Response\nThe adaptive immune response is a slower-acting, longer-\nlasting, and more specific response than the innate\nresponse. However, the adaptive response requires\ninformation from the innate immune system to function.\nAPCs display antigens via MHC molecules to complementary\nna\u00efve T cells. In response, the T cells differentiate and\nproliferate, becoming TH cells or CTLs. TH cells stimulate B\ncells that have engulfed and presented pathogen-derived\nantigens. B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete\nantibodies, whereas CTLs induce apoptosis in intracellularly\ninfected or cancerous cells. Memory cells persist after a\nprimary exposure to a pathogen. If reexposure occurs,\nmemory cells differentiate into effector cells without input\nfrom the innate immune system. The mucosal immune\nsystem is largely independent from the systemic immune\nsystem but functions in a parallel fashion to protect the\nextensive mucosal surfaces of the body.\n42.3 Antibodies\nAntibodies (immunoglobulins) are the molecules secreted\nfrom plasma cells that mediate the humoral immune\nresponse. There are five antibody classes; an antibody's class\ndetermines its mechanism of action and production site but\ndoes not control its binding specificity. Antibodies bind\nantigens via variable domains and can either neutralize\npathogens or mark them for phagocytosis or activate the\ncomplement cascade.\n42.4 Disruptions in the Immune\nSystem\nImmune disruptions may involve insufficient immune\nresponses or inappropriate immune targets.\nImmunodeficiency increases an individual's susceptibility to\ninfections and cancers. Hypersensitivities are misdirected\nresponses either to harmless foreign particles, as in the case\nof allergies, or to host factors, as in the case of\nautoimmunity.

(credit:\nmodification of work by \"cliff1066\"/Flickr)\nINTRODUCTION Animal reproduction is necessary for the survival of a species. In the animal\nkingdom, there are innumerable ways that species reproduce. Asexual reproduction produces genetically\nidentical organisms (clones), whereas in sexual reproduction, the genetic material of two individuals\ncombines to produce offspring that are genetically different from their parents. During sexual\nreproduction the male gamete (sperm) may be placed inside the female\u2019s body for internal fertilization,\nor the sperm and eggs may be released into the environment for external fertilization. Seahorses, like the\none shown in Figure 43.1, provide an example of the latter. Following a mating dance, the female lays\neggs in the male seahorse\u2019s abdominal brood pouch where they are fertilized. The eggs hatch and the\noffspring develop in the pouch for several weeks.\nChapter Outline\n43.1 Reproduction\nMethods\n43.2 Fertilization\n43.3 Human\nReproductive\nAnatomy and\nGametogenesis\n43.4 Hormonal Control\nof Human\nReproduction\n43.5 Human Pregnancy\nand Birth\n43.6 Fertilization and\nEarly Embryonic\nDevelopment\n43.7 Organogenesis and\nVertebrate\nFormation\n43.1 Reproduction Methods\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe advantages and disadvantages of asexual and sexual reproduction\n\u2022\nDiscuss asexual reproduction methods\n\u2022\nDiscuss sexual reproduction methods\nAnimals produce offspring through asexual and/or sexual reproduction. Both methods have advantages and\ndisadvantages. Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because\nthe offspring are all clones of the original parent. A single individual can produce offspring asexually and\nlarge numbers of offspring can be produced quickly. In a stable or predictable environment, asexual\nreproduction is an effective means of reproduction because all the offspring will be adapted to that\nenvironment. In an unstable or unpredictable environment asexually-reproducing species may be at a\ndisadvantage because all the offspring are genetically identical and may not have the genetic variation to\nsurvive in new or different conditions. On the other hand, the rapid rates of asexual reproduction may allow\nfor a speedy response to environmental changes if individuals have mutations. An additional advantage of\nasexual reproduction is that colonization of new habitats may be easier when an individual does not need to\nfind a mate to reproduce.\nDuring sexual reproduction the genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically\ndiverse offspring that differ from their parents. The genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is\nthought to give species a better chance of surviving in an unpredictable or changing environment. Species\nthat reproduce sexually must maintain two different types of individuals, males and females, which can\nlimit the ability to colonize new habitats as both sexes must be present.\nAsexual Reproduction\nAsexual reproduction occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms (bacteria) and in some eukaryotic single-celled\nand multi-celled organisms. There are a number of ways that animals reproduce asexually.\nFission\nFission, also called binary fission, occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate, multi-\ncelled organisms. After a period of growth, an organism splits into two separate organisms. Some\nunicellular eukaryotic organisms undergo binary fission by mitosis. In other organisms, part of the\nindividual separates and forms a second individual. This process occurs, for example, in many asteroid\nechinoderms through splitting of the central disk. Some sea anemones and some coral polyps (Figure 43.2)\nalso reproduce through fission.\nFigure 43.2 Coral polyps reproduce asexually by fission. (credit: G. P. Schmahl, NOAA FGBNMS Manager)\nBudding\nBudding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell or body region\n1226\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nleading to a separation from the original organism into two individuals. Budding occurs commonly in some invertebrate\nanimals such as corals and hydras. In hydras, a bud forms that develops into an adult and breaks away from the main body, as\nillustrated in Figure 43.3, whereas in coral budding, the bud does not detach and multiplies as part of a new colony.\nFigure 43.3 Hydra reproduce asexually through budding.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch a video of a hydra budding.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/budding_hydra)\nFragmentation\nFragmentation is the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration. If the animal is capable of\nfragmentation, and the part is big enough, a separate individual will regrow.\nFor example, in many sea stars, asexual reproduction is accomplished by fragmentation. Figure 43.4 illustrates a sea star for\nwhich an arm of the individual is broken off and regenerates a new sea star. Fisheries workers have been known to try to kill the\nsea stars eating their clam or oyster beds by cutting them in half and throwing them back into the ocean. Unfortunately for the\nworkers, the two parts can each regenerate a new half, resulting in twice as many sea stars to prey upon the oysters and clams.\nFragmentation also occurs in annelid worms, turbellarians, and poriferans.\nFigure 43.4 Sea stars can reproduce through fragmentation. The large arm, a fragment from another sea star, is developing into a new\nindividual.\nNote that in fragmentation, there is generally a noticeable difference in the size of the individuals, whereas in fission, two\nindividuals of approximate size are formed.\n43.1 \u2022 Reproduction Methods\n1227\nParthenogenesis\nParthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being fertilized.\nThe resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid, depending on the process and the species. Parthenogenesis occurs in\ninvertebrates such as water fleas, rotifers, aphids, stick insects, some ants, wasps, and bees. Bees use parthenogenesis to\nproduce haploid males (drones). If eggs are fertilized, diploid females develop, and if the fertilized eggs are fed a special diet (so\ncalled royal jelly), a queen is produced.\nSome vertebrate animals\u2014such as certain reptiles, amphibians, and fish\u2014also reproduce through parthenogenesis. Although\nmore common in plants, parthenogenesis has been observed in animal species that were segregated by sex in terrestrial or\nmarine zoos. Two female Komodo dragons, a hammerhead shark, and a blacktop shark have produced parthenogenic young\nwhen the females have been isolated from males.\nSexual Reproduction\nSexual reproduction is the combination of (usually haploid) reproductive cells from two individuals to form a third (usually\ndiploid) unique offspring. Sexual reproduction produces offspring with novel combinations of genes. This can be an adaptive\nadvantage in unstable or unpredictable environments. As humans, we are used to thinking of animals as having two separate\nsexes\u2014male and female\u2014determined at conception. However, in the animal kingdom, there are many variations on this theme.\nHermaphroditism\nHermaphroditism occurs in animals where one individual has both male and female reproductive parts. Invertebrates such as\nearthworms, slugs, tapeworms and snails, shown in Figure 43.5, are often hermaphroditic. Hermaphrodites may self-fertilize or\nmay mate with another of their species, fertilizing each other and both producing offspring. Self fertilization is common in\nanimals that have limited mobility or are not motile, such as barnacles and clams.\nFigure 43.5 Many snails are hermaphrodites. When two individuals mate, they can produce up to one hundred eggs each. (credit: Assaf\nShtilman)\nSex Determination\nMammalian sex determination is determined genetically by the presence of X and Y chromosomes. Individuals homozygous for\nX (XX) are female and heterozygous individuals (XY) are male. The presence of a Y chromosome causes the development of male\ncharacteristics and its absence results in female characteristics. The XY system is also found in some insects and plants.\nAvian sex determination is dependent on the presence of Z and W chromosomes. Homozygous for Z (ZZ) results in a male and\nheterozygous (ZW) results in a female. The W appears to be essential in determining the sex of the individual, similar to the Y\nchromosome in mammals. Some fish, crustaceans, insects (such as butterflies and moths), and reptiles use this system.\nThe sex of some species is not determined by genetics but by some aspect of the environment. Sex determination in some\ncrocodiles and turtles, for example, is often dependent on the temperature during critical periods of egg development. This is\nreferred to as environmental sex determination, or more specifically as temperature-dependent sex determination. In many\nturtles, cooler temperatures during egg incubation produce males and warm temperatures produce females. In some crocodiles,\nmoderate temperatures produce males and both warm and cool temperatures produce females. In some species, sex is both\n1228\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ngenetic- and temperature-dependent.\nIndividuals of some species change their sex during their lives, alternating between male and female. If the individual is female\nfirst, it is termed protogyny or \u201cfirst female,\u201d if it is male first, its termed protandry or \u201cfirst male.\u201d Oysters, for example, are\nborn male, grow, and become female and lay eggs; some oyster species change sex multiple times.\n43.2 Fertilization\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss internal and external methods of fertilization\n\u2022\nDescribe the methods used by animals for development of offspring during gestation\n\u2022\nDescribe the anatomical adaptions that occurred in animals to facilitate reproduction\nSexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. This can occur either\ninside (internal fertilization) or outside (external fertilization) the body of the female. Humans provide an example of the\nformer whereas seahorse reproduction is an example of the latter.\nExternal Fertilization\nExternal fertilization usually occurs in aquatic environments where both eggs and sperm are released into the water. After the\nsperm reaches the egg, fertilization takes place. Most external fertilization happens during the process of spawning where one\nor several females release their eggs and the male(s) release sperm in the same area, at the same time. The release of the\nreproductive material may be triggered by water temperature or the length of daylight. Nearly all fish spawn, as do crustaceans\n(such as crabs and shrimp), mollusks (such as oysters), squid, and echinoderms (such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers). Figure\n43.6 shows salmon spawning in a shallow stream. Frogs, like those shown in Figure 43.7, corals, molluscs, and sea cucumbers\nalso spawn.\nFigure 43.6 Salmon reproduce through spawning. (credit: Dan Bennett)\n43.2 \u2022 Fertilization\n1229\nFigure 43.7 During sexual reproduction in toads, the male grasps the female from behind and externally fertilizes the eggs as they are\ndeposited. (credit: \"OakleyOriginals\"/Flickr)\nPairs of fish that are not broadcast spawners may exhibit courtship behavior. This allows the female to select a particular male.\nThe trigger for egg and sperm release (spawning) causes the egg and sperm to be placed in a small area, enhancing the\npossibility of fertilization.\nExternal fertilization in an aquatic environment protects the eggs from drying out. Broadcast spawning can result in a greater\nmixture of the genes within a group, leading to higher genetic diversity and a greater chance of species survival in a hostile\nenvironment. For sessile aquatic organisms like sponges, broadcast spawning is the only mechanism for fertilization and\ncolonization of new environments. The presence of the fertilized eggs and developing young in the water provides opportunities\nfor predation resulting in a loss of offspring. Therefore, millions of eggs must be produced by individuals, and the offspring\nproduced through this method must mature rapidly. The survival rate of eggs produced through broadcast spawning is low.\nInternal Fertilization\nInternal fertilization occurs most often in land-based animals, although some aquatic animals also use this method. There are\nthree ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization. In oviparity, fertilized eggs are laid outside the female\u2019s\nbody and develop there, receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg. This occurs in most bony fish, many\nreptiles, some cartilaginous fish, most amphibians, two mammals, and all birds. Reptiles and insects produce leathery eggs,\nwhile birds and turtles produce eggs with high concentrations of calcium carbonate in the shell, making them hard. Chicken\neggs are an example of this second type.\nIn ovoviparity, fertilized eggs are retained in the female, but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg\u2019s yolk and the\nyoung are fully developed when they are hatched. This occurs in some bony fish (like the guppy Lebistes reticulatus), some\nsharks, some lizards, some snakes (such as the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis), some vipers, and some invertebrate animals\n(like the Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa).\nIn viviparity the young develop within the female, receiving nourishment from the mother\u2019s blood through a placenta. The\noffspring develops in the female and is born alive. This occurs in most mammals, some cartilaginous fish, and a few reptiles.\nInternal fertilization has the advantage of protecting the fertilized egg from dehydration on land. The embryo is isolated within\nthe female, which limits predation on the young. Internal fertilization enhances the fertilization of eggs by a specific male.\nFewer offspring are produced through this method, but their survival rate is higher than that for external fertilization.\nThe Evolution of Reproduction\nOnce multicellular organisms evolved and developed specialized cells, some also developed tissues and organs with specialized\nfunctions. An early development in reproduction occurred in the Annelids. These organisms produce sperm and eggs from\n1230\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nundifferentiated cells in their coelom and store them in that cavity. When the coelom becomes filled, the cells are released\nthrough an excretory opening or by the body splitting open. Reproductive organs evolved with the development of gonads that\nproduce sperm and eggs. These cells went through meiosis, an adaption of mitosis, which reduced the number of chromosomes\nin each reproductive cell by half, while increasing the number of cells through cell division.\nComplete reproductive systems were developed in insects, with separate sexes. Sperm are made in testes and then travel\nthrough coiled tubes to the epididymis for storage. Eggs mature in the ovary. When they are released from the ovary, they travel\nto the uterine tubes for fertilization. Some insects have a specialized sac, called a spermatheca, which stores sperm for later use,\nsometimes up to a year. Fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for offspring survival.\nVertebrates have similar structures, with a few differences. Non-mammals, such as birds and reptiles, have a common body\nopening, called a cloaca, for the digestive, excretory and reproductive systems. Coupling between birds usually involves\npositioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm. Mammals have separate openings for the systems in\nthe female and a uterus for support of developing offspring. The uterus has two chambers in species that produce large numbers\nof offspring at a time, while species that produce one offspring, such as primates, have a single uterus.\nSperm transfer from the male to the female during reproduction ranges from releasing the sperm into the watery environment\nfor external fertilization, to the joining of cloaca in birds, to the development of a penis for direct delivery into the female\u2019s\nvagina in mammals.\n43.3 Human Reproductive Anatomy and Gametogenesis\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe human male and female reproductive anatomies\n\u2022\nDiscuss the human sexual response\n\u2022\nDescribe spermatogenesis and oogenesis and discuss their differences and similarities\nAs animals became more complex, specific organs and organ systems developed to support specific functions for the organism.\nThe reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally, and support the\ngrowth and development of offspring.\nHuman Reproductive Anatomy\nThe reproductive tissues of male and female humans develop similarly in utero until a low level of the hormone testosterone is\nreleased from male gonads. Testosterone causes the undeveloped tissues to differentiate into male sexual organs. When\ntestosterone is absent, the tissues develop into female sexual tissues. Primitive gonads become testes or ovaries. Tissues that\nproduce a penis in males produce a clitoris in females. The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a\nfemale; that is, they are homologous structures.\nMale Reproductive Anatomy\nIn the male reproductive system, the scrotum houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage for\nblood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce\nsperm and some reproductive hormones. Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 in.) in size and divided into wedge-\nshaped lobules by connective tissue called septa. Coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce sperm.\nSperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the scrotum and penis are external to the body, as illustrated in Figure 43.8\nso that a proper temperature is maintained for motility. In land mammals, the pair of testes must be suspended outside the\nbody at about 2\u00b0 C lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm. Infertility can occur in land mammals when the testes\ndo not descend through the abdominal cavity during fetal development.\n43.3 \u2022 Human Reproductive Anatomy and Gametogenesis\n1231\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 43.8 The reproductive structures of the human male are shown.\nWhich of the following statements about the male reproductive system is false?\na.\nThe vas deferens carries sperm from the testes to the penis.\nb.\nSperm mature in seminiferous tubules in the testes.\nc.\nBoth the prostate and the bulbourethral glands produce components of the semen.\nd.\nThe prostate gland is located in the testes.\nSperm mature in seminiferous tubules that are coiled inside the testes, as illustrated in Figure 43.8. The walls of the\nseminiferous tubules are made up of the developing sperm cells, with the least developed sperm at the periphery of the tubule\nand the fully developed sperm in the lumen. The sperm cells are mixed with \u201cnursemaid\u201d cells called Sertoli cells which protect\nthe germ cells and promote their development. Other cells mixed in the wall of the tubules are the interstitial cells of Leydig.\nThese cells produce high levels of testosterone once the male reaches adolescence.\nWhen the sperm have developed flagella and are nearly mature, they leave the testicles and enter the epididymis, shown in\nFigure 43.8. This structure resembles a comma and lies along the top and posterior portion of the testes; it is the site of sperm\nmaturation. The sperm leave the epididymis and enter the vas deferens (or ductus deferens), which carries the sperm, behind\nthe bladder, and forms the ejaculatory duct with the duct from the seminal vesicles. During a vasectomy, a section of the vas\ndeferens is removed, preventing sperm from being passed out of the body during ejaculation and preventing fertilization.\nSemen is a mixture of sperm and spermatic duct secretions (about 10 percent of the total) and fluids from accessory glands that\ncontribute most of the semen\u2019s volume. Sperm are haploid cells, consisting of a flagellum as a tail, a neck that contains the cell\u2019s\nenergy-producing mitochondria, and a head that contains the genetic material. Figure 43.9 shows a micrograph of human\nsperm as well as a diagram of the parts of the sperm. An acrosome is found at the top of the head of the sperm. This structure\ncontains lysosomal enzymes that can digest the protective coverings that surround the egg to help the sperm penetrate and\nfertilize the egg. An ejaculate will contain from two to five milliliters of fluid with from 50\u2013120 million sperm per milliliter.\n1232\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 43.9 Human sperm, visualized using scanning electron microscopy, have a flagellum, neck, and head. (credit b: modification of work\nby Mariana Ruiz Villareal; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe bulk of the semen comes from the accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system. These are the seminal\nvesicles, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral gland, all of which are illustrated in Figure 43.8. The seminal vesicles are a\npair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder. The glands make a solution that is thick, yellowish, and\nalkaline. As sperm are only motile in an alkaline environment, a basic pH is important to reverse the acidity of the vaginal\nenvironment. The solution also contains mucus, fructose (a sperm mitochondrial nutrient), a coagulating enzyme, ascorbic\nacid, and local-acting hormones called prostaglandins. The seminal vesicle glands account for 60 percent of the bulk of semen.\nThe penis, illustrated in Figure 43.8, is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as a copulatory organ\nduring intercourse. The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ. These consist of a\npair of tubes on the dorsal side, called the corpus cavernosum, and a single tube of tissue on the ventral side, called the corpus\nspongiosum. This tissue will become engorged with blood, becoming erect and hard, in preparation for intercourse. The organ\nis inserted into the vagina culminating with an ejaculation. During intercourse, the smooth muscle sphincters at the opening to\nthe renal bladder close and prevent urine from entering the penis. An orgasm is a two-stage process: first, glands and accessory\norgans connected to the testes contract, then semen (containing sperm) is expelled through the urethra during ejaculation. After\nintercourse, the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes flaccid.\nThe walnut-shaped prostate gland surrounds the urethra, the connection to the urinary bladder. It has a series of short ducts\nthat directly connect to the urethra. The gland is a mixture of smooth muscle and glandular tissue. The muscle provides much of\nthe force needed for ejaculation to occur. The glandular tissue makes a thin, milky fluid that contains citrate (a nutrient),\nenzymes, and prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA is a proteolytic enzyme that helps to liquefy the ejaculate several minutes\nafter release from the male. Prostate gland secretions account for about 30 percent of the bulk of semen.\nThe bulbourethral gland, or Cowper\u2019s gland, releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen. It neutralizes any\nacid residue in the urethra left over from urine. This usually accounts for a couple of drops of fluid in the total ejaculate and may\ncontain a few sperm. Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation to prevent pregnancy may not work if sperm\nare present in the bulbourethral gland secretions.

These include the breasts and the vulva, which consists of\nthe mons pubis, clitoris, labia majora, labia minora, and the vestibular glands, all illustrated in Figure 43.10. The location and\nfunctions of the female reproductive organs are summarized in Table 43.2. The vulva is an area associated with the vestibule\nwhich includes the structures found in the inguinal (groin) area of women. The mons pubis is a round, fatty area that overlies\nthe pubic symphysis. The clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as\na source of stimulation during intercourse. The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the\nmons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva. The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the\nscrotum in a male. The labia minora are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the labia majora. These labia protect the\nopenings to the vagina and urethra. The mons pubis and the anterior portion of the labia majora become covered with hair\nduring adolescence; the labia minora is hairless. The greater vestibular glands are found at the sides of the vaginal opening and\nprovide lubrication during intercourse.\nFigure 43.10 The reproductive structures of the human female are shown.

The size of the breast is determined by the amount of fat deposited behind the\ngland. Each gland consists of 15 to 25 lobes that have ducts that empty at the nipple and that supply the nursing child with\nnutrient- and antibody-rich milk to aid development and protect the child.\nInternal female reproductive structures include ovaries, oviducts, the uterus, and the vagina, shown in Figure 43.10. The pair of\novaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments. Ovaries consist of a medulla and cortex: the medulla\ncontains nerves and blood vessels to supply the cortex with nutrients and remove waste. The outer layers of cells of the cortex are\nthe functional parts of the ovaries. The cortex is made up of follicular cells that surround eggs that develop during fetal\ndevelopment in utero. During the menstrual period, a batch of follicular cells develops and prepares the eggs for release. At\novulation, one follicle ruptures and one egg is released, as illustrated in Figure 43.11a.\nFigure 43.11 Oocytes develop in (a) follicles, located in the ovary. At the beginning of the menstrual cycle, the follicle matures. At ovulation,\nthe follicle ruptures, releasing the egg. The follicle becomes a corpus luteum, which eventually degenerates. The (b) follicle in this light\nmicrograph has an oocyte at its center. (credit a: modification of work by NIH; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nThe oviducts, or fallopian tubes, extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries, but they are not in contact\nwith the ovaries. The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet-like structure and have a fringe of finger-like\nprojections called fimbriae, illustrated in Figure 43.10b. When an egg is released at ovulation, the fimbrae help the nonmotile\negg enter into the tube and passage to the uterus. The walls of the oviducts are ciliated and are made up mostly of smooth\n43.3 \u2022 Human Reproductive Anatomy and Gametogenesis\n1235\nmuscle. The cilia beat toward the middle, and the smooth muscle contracts in the same direction, moving the egg toward the\nuterus. Fertilization usually takes place within the oviducts and the developing embryo is moved toward the uterus for\ndevelopment. It usually takes the egg or embryo a week to travel through the oviduct. Sterilization in women is called a tubal\nligation; it is analogous to a vasectomy in males in that the oviducts are severed and sealed.\nThe uterus is a structure about the size of a woman\u2019s fist. This is lined with an endometrium rich in blood vessels and mucus\nglands. The uterus supports the developing embryo and fetus during gestation. The thickest portion of the wall of the uterus is\nmade of smooth muscle. Contractions of the smooth muscle in the uterus aid in passing the baby through the vagina during\nlabor. A portion of the lining of the uterus sloughs off during each menstrual period, and then builds up again in preparation for\nan implantation. Part of the uterus, called the cervix, protrudes into the top of the vagina. The cervix functions as the birth\ncanal.\nThe vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes. It allows menstrual flow to leave the body. It is the receptacle for the\npenis during intercourse and the vessel for the delivery of offspring. It is lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells to protect\nthe underlying tissue.\nSexual Response during Intercourse\nThe sexual response in humans is both psychological and physiological. Both sexes experience sexual arousal through\npsychological and physical stimulation. There are four phases of the sexual response. During phase one, called excitement,\nvasodilation leads to vasocongestion in erectile tissues in both men and women. The nipples, clitoris, labia, and penis engorge\nwith blood and become enlarged. Vaginal secretions are released to lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse. During the\nsecond phase, called the plateau, stimulation continues, the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood, and breathing\nand heart rate increase.\nDuring phase three, or orgasm, rhythmic, involuntary contractions of muscles occur in both sexes. In the male, the reproductive\naccessory glands and tubules constrict placing semen in the urethra, then the urethra contracts expelling the semen through the\npenis. In women, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a second each. During phase\nfour, or resolution, the processes described in the first three phases reverse themselves and return to their normal state. Men\nexperience a refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period of time ranging from minutes\nto hours.\nGametogenesis (Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis)\nGametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, takes place through the process of meiosis. During meiosis, two cell\ndivisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier\nstage of the cell\u2019s life cycle. Meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells.\nThe production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis.\n1236\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nSpermatogenesis\nFigure 43.12 During spermatogenesis, four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte.\nSpermatogenesis, illustrated in Figure 43.12, occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules (Figure 43.8), with stem cells at the\nperiphery of the tube and the spermatozoa at the lumen of the tube. Immediately under the capsule of the tubule are diploid,\nundifferentiated cells. These stem cells, called spermatogonia (singular: spermatagonium), go through mitosis with one\noffspring going on to differentiate into a sperm cell and the other giving rise to the next generation of sperm.\nMeiosis starts with a cell called a primary spermatocyte. At the end of the first meiotic division, a haploid cell is produced called\na secondary spermatocyte. This cell is haploid and must go through another meiotic cell division. The cell produced at the end of\nmeiosis is called a spermatid and when it reaches the lumen of the tubule and grows a flagellum, it is called a sperm cell. Four\nsperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis.\nStem cells are deposited during gestation and are present at birth through the beginning of adolescence, but in an inactive state.\nDuring adolescence, gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary cause the activation of these cells and the production of\nviable sperm. This continues into old age.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/spermatogenesis) to see the process of spermatogenesis.\nOogenesis\nOogenesis, illustrated in Figure 43.13, occurs in the outermost layers of the ovaries. As with sperm production, oogenesis starts\nwith a germ cell, called an oogonium (plural: oogonia), but this cell undergoes mitosis to increase in number, eventually\nresulting in up to about one to two million cells in the embryo.\n43.3 \u2022 Human Reproductive Anatomy and Gametogenesis\n1237\nFigure 43.13 The process of oogenesis occurs in the ovary\u2019s outermost layer.\nThe cell starting meiosis is called a primary oocyte, as shown in Figure 43.13. This cell will start the first meiotic division and be\narrested in its progress in the first prophase stage. At the time of birth, all future eggs are in the prophase stage. At adolescence,\nanterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a number of follicles in an ovary. This results in the primary oocyte\nfinishing the first meiotic division. The cell divides unequally, with most of the cellular material and organelles going to one cell,\ncalled a secondary oocyte, and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm going to the other cell. This\nsecond cell is called a polar body and usually dies. A secondary meiotic arrest occurs, this time at the metaphase II stage. At\novulation, this secondary oocyte will be released and travel toward the uterus through the oviduct. If the secondary oocyte is\nfertilized, the cell continues through the meiosis II, producing a second polar body and a fertilized egg containing all 46\nchromosomes of a human being, half of them coming from the sperm.\nEgg production begins before birth, is arrested during meiosis until puberty, and then individual cells continue through at each\nmenstrual cycle. One egg is produced from each meiotic process, with the extra chromosomes and chromatids going into polar\nbodies that degenerate and are reabsorbed by the body.\n43.4 Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the roles of male and female reproductive hormones\n\u2022\nDiscuss the interplay of the ovarian and menstrual cycles\n\u2022\nDescribe the process of menopause\nThe human male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by the interaction of hormones from the hypothalamus and\nanterior pituitary with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. In both sexes, the hypothalamus monitors and causes\nthe release of hormones from the pituitary gland. When the reproductive hormone is required, the hypothalamus sends a\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to the anterior pituitary. This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone\n(FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary into the blood. Note that the body must reach puberty in order\nfor the adrenals to release the hormones that must be present for GnRH to be produced. Although FSH and LH are named after\ntheir functions in female reproduction, they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling reproduction.\nOther hormones have specific functions in the male and female reproductive systems.\nMale Hormones\nAt the onset of puberty, the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time. FSH enters\n1238\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nthe testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback, as illustrated in Figure\n43.14. LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and\nthe blood.\nTestosterone, the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence,\nstimulates spermatogenesis. These secondary sex characteristics include a deepening of the voice, the growth of facial, axillary,\nand pubic hair, and the beginnings of the sex drive.\nFigure 43.14 Hormones control sperm production in a negative feedback system.\nA negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior\npituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH, FSH, and LH. The Sertoli cells produce the hormone inhibin, which is released into the\nblood when the sperm count is too high. This inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow\ndown. If the sperm count reaches 20 million/ml, the Sertoli cells cease the release of inhibin, and the sperm count increases.\nFemale Hormones\nThe control of reproduction in females is more complex. As with the male, the anterior pituitary hormones cause the release of\nthe hormones FSH and LH. In addition, estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles. Estrogen is the\nreproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth, ovulation, and calcium absorption; it is also responsible\nfor the secondary sexual characteristics of females. These include breast development, flaring of the hips, and a shorter period\nnecessary for bone maturation. Progesterone assists in endometrial regrowth and inhibition of FSH and LH release.\nIn females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. Follicle cells produce\nthe hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production. LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of ovulation, and\nstimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. Estradiol and progesterone are steroid hormones that\nprepare the body for pregnancy. Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both estradiol and\nprogesterone regulate the menstrual cycle.\nThe Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle\nThe ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while the menstrual cycle governs the\npreparation and maintenance of the uterine lining. These cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 22\u201332 day cycle,\nwith an average length of 28 days.\nThe first half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase shown in Figure 43.15. Slowly rising levels of FSH and LH cause the\ngrowth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. This process prepares the egg for ovulation. As the follicles grow, they begin\nreleasing estrogens and a low level of progesterone. Progesterone maintains the endometrium to help ensure pregnancy. The\ntrip through the fallopian tube takes about seven days. At this stage of development, called the morula, there are 30-60 cells. If\npregnancy implantation does not occur, the lining is sloughed off. After about five days, estrogen levels rise and the menstrual\ncycle enters the proliferative phase. The endometrium begins to regrow, replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated\nduring the end of the last cycle.\n43.4 \u2022 Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction\n1239\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 43.15 The ovarian and menstrual cycles of female reproduction are regulated by hormones produced by the hypothalamus,\npituitary, and ovaries.\nWhich of the following statements about hormone regulation of the female reproductive cycle is false?\na.\nLH and FSH are produced in the pituitary, and estradiol and progesterone are produced in the ovaries.\nb.\nEstradiol and progesterone secreted from the corpus luteum cause the endometrium to thicken.\nc.\nBoth progesterone and estradiol are produced by the follicles.\nd.\nSecretion of GnRH by the hypothalamus is inhibited by low levels of estradiol but stimulated by high levels of estradiol.\nJust prior to the middle of the cycle (approximately day 14), the high level of estrogen causes FSH and especially LH to rise\nrapidly, then fall. The spike in LH causes ovulation: the most mature follicle, like that shown in Figure 43.16, ruptures and\nreleases its egg. The follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost. The level of estrogen decreases when the\nextra follicles degenerate.\n1240\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 43.16 This mature egg follicle may rupture and release an egg. (credit: scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nFollowing ovulation, the ovarian cycle enters its luteal phase, illustrated in Figure 43.15 and the menstrual cycle enters its\nsecretory phase, both of which run from about day 15 to 28. The luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in the ruptured\nfollicle. The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum\nproduces estrogen and progesterone. The progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of\nfurther FSH and LH. The uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. The inhibition of\nFSH and LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated. The level of estrogen\nproduced by the corpus luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days.\nIf no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen and progesterone\ndecrease. The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating the next menstrual cycle. The\ndecrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior pituitary, releasing FSH and LH and\nstarting the cycles again. Figure 43.17 visually compares the ovarian and uterine cycles as well as the commensurate hormone\nlevels.\n43.4 \u2022 Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction\n1241\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 43.17 Rising and falling hormone levels result in progression of the ovarian and menstrual cycles.

Menstrual periods\nbecome less frequent and finally cease; this is menopause. There are still eggs and potential follicles on the ovaries, but without\nthe stimulation of FSH and LH, they will not produce a viable egg to be released. The outcome of this is the inability to have\nchildren.\nThe side effects of menopause include hot flashes, heavy sweating (especially at night), headaches, some hair loss, muscle pain,\nvaginal dryness, insomnia, depression, weight gain, and mood swings. Estrogen is involved in calcium metabolism and,\nwithout it, blood levels of calcium decrease. To replenish the blood, calcium is lost from bone which may decrease the bone\ndensity and lead to osteoporosis. Supplementation of estrogen in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can prevent\nbone loss, but the therapy can have negative side effects. While HRT is thought to give some protection from colon cancer,\nosteoporosis, heart disease, macular degeneration, and possibly depression, its negative side effects include increased risk of:\nstroke or heart attack, blood clots, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gall bladder disease, and possibly\ndementia.\n1242\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nReproductive Endocrinologist\nA reproductive endocrinologist is a physician who treats a variety of hormonal disorders related to reproduction and infertility\nin both men and women. The disorders include menstrual problems, infertility, pregnancy loss, sexual dysfunction, and\nmenopause. Doctors may use fertility drugs, surgery, or assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in their therapy. ART involves\nthe use of procedures to manipulate the egg or sperm to facilitate reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization.\nReproductive endocrinologists undergo extensive medical training, first in a four-year residency in obstetrics and gynecology,\nthen in a three-year fellowship in reproductive endocrinology. To be board certified in this area, the physician must pass written\nand oral exams in both areas.\n43.5 Human Pregnancy and Birth\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain fetal development during the three trimesters of gestation\n\u2022\nDescribe labor and delivery\n\u2022\nCompare the efficacy and duration of various types of contraception\n\u2022\nDiscuss causes of infertility and the therapeutic options available\nPregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual. The length of time of\ngestation varies among animals, but is very similar among the great apes: human gestation is 266 days, while chimpanzee\ngestation is 237 days, a gorilla\u2019s is 257 days, and orangutan gestation is 260 days long. The fox has a 57-day gestation. Dogs and\ncats have similar gestations averaging 60 days. The longest gestation for a land mammal is an African elephant at 640 days. The\nlongest gestations among marine mammals are the beluga and sperm whales at 460 days.\nHuman Gestation\nTwenty-four hours before fertilization, the egg has finished meiosis and becomes a mature oocyte. When fertilized (at\nconception) the egg becomes known as a zygote. The zygote travels through the oviduct to the uterus (Figure 43.18). The\ndeveloping embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. The outer layers of\nthe zygote (blastocyst) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and wound healing of the endometrium\ncloses up the blastocyst into the tissue. Another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing a hormone called human\nbeta chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-HCG) which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active. This ensures\nadequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo.\nPregnancy tests determine the level of \u03b2-HCG in urine or serum. If the hormone is present, the test is positive.\n43.5 \u2022 Human Pregnancy and Birth\n1243\nFigure 43.18 In humans, fertilization occurs soon after the oocyte leaves the ovary. Implantation occurs eight or nine days later.(credit: Ed\nUthman)\nThe gestation period is divided into three equal periods or trimesters. During the first two to four weeks of the first trimester,\nnutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion. As the trimester progresses, the outer layer of the\nembryo begins to merge with the endometrium, and the placenta forms. This organ takes over the nutrient and waste\nrequirements of the embryo and fetus, with the mother\u2019s blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it.\nChemicals from the fetus, such as bilirubin, are processed by the mother\u2019s liver for elimination. Some of the mother\u2019s\nimmunoglobulins will pass through the placenta, providing passive immunity against some potential infections.\nInternal organs and body structures begin to develop during the first trimester. By five weeks, limb buds, eyes, the heart, and\nliver have been basically formed. By eight weeks, the term fetus applies, and the body is essentially formed, as shown in Figure\n43.19. The individual is about five centimeters (two inches) in length and many of the organs, such as the lungs and liver, are not\nyet functioning. Exposure to any toxins is especially dangerous during the first trimester, as all of the body\u2019s organs and\nstructures are going through initial development. Anything that affects that development can have a severe effect on the fetus\u2019\nsurvival.\n1244\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 43.19 Fetal development is shown at nine weeks gestation. (credit: Ed Uthman)\nDuring the second trimester, the fetus grows to about 30 cm (12 inches), as shown in Figure 43.20. It becomes active and the\nmother usually feels the first movements. All organs and structures continue to develop. The placenta has taken over the\nfunctions of nutrition and waste and the production of estrogen and progesterone from the corpus luteum, which has\ndegenerated. The placenta will continue functioning up through the delivery of the baby.\nFigure 43.20 This fetus is just entering the second trimester, when the placenta takes over more of the functions performed as the baby\ndevelops. (credit: National Museum of Health and Medicine)\nDuring the third trimester, the fetus grows to 3 to 4 kg (6 \u00bd -8 \u00bd lbs.) and about 50 cm (19-20 inches) long, as illustrated in Figure\n43.21. This is the period of the most rapid growth during the pregnancy. Organ development continues to birth (and some\nsystems, such as the nervous system and liver, continue to develop after birth). The mother will be at her most uncomfortable\n43.5 \u2022 Human Pregnancy and Birth\n1245\nduring this trimester. She may urinate frequently due to pressure on the bladder from the fetus. There may also be intestinal\nblockage and circulatory problems, especially in her legs. Clots may form in her legs due to pressure from the fetus on returning\nveins as they enter the abdominal cavity.\nFigure 43.21 There is rapid fetal growth during the third trimester.

Toward the end\nof the third trimester, estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the hormone oxytocin. At this time, the\nbaby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head engaging the cervix (uterine opening). This causes\nthe cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the hypothalamus, which signals for the release of oxytocin from the\nposterior pituitary. The oxytocin causes the smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract. At the same time, the placenta\nreleases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions. A positive feedback relay occurs between the uterus,\nhypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. As more smooth muscle cells are recruited,\nthe contractions increase in intensity and force.\nThere are three stages to labor. During stage one, the cervix thins and dilates. This is necessary for the baby and placenta to be\nexpelled during birth. The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm. During stage two, the baby is expelled from the uterus.\nThe uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery. The last stage is the\npassage of the placenta after the baby has been born and the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine wall. If labor\nshould stop before stage two is reached, synthetic oxytocin, known as Pitocin, can be administered to restart and maintain\nlabor.\nAn alternative to labor and delivery is the surgical delivery of the baby through a procedure called a Caesarian section. This is\nmajor abdominal surgery and can lead to post-surgical complications for the mother, but in some cases it may be the only way to\nsafely deliver the baby.\nThe mother\u2019s mammary glands go through changes during the third trimester to prepare for lactation and breastfeeding. When\nthe baby begins suckling at the breast, signals are sent to the hypothalamus causing the release of prolactin from the anterior\npituitary. Prolactin causes the mammary glands to produce milk. Oxytocin is also released, promoting the release of the milk.\n1246\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nThe milk contains nutrients for the baby\u2019s development and growth as well as immunoglobulins to protect the child from\nbacterial and viral infections.\nContraception and Birth Control\nThe prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control. Strictly speaking, contraception refers to\npreventing the sperm and egg from joining. Both terms are, however, frequently used interchangeably.\nContraceptive Methods\nMethod\nExamples\nFailure Rate in Typical Use Over 12\nMonths\nBarrier\nmale condom, female condom, sponge, cervical cap, diaphragm,\nspermicides\n15 to 24%\nHormonal\noral, patch, vaginal ring\n8%\ninjection\n3%\nimplant\nless than 1%\nOther\nnatural family planning\n12 to 25%\nwithdrawal\n27%\nsterilization\nless than 1%\nTable 43.3\nTable 43.3 lists common methods of contraception. The failure rates listed are not the ideal rates that could be realized, but the\ntypical rates that occur. A failure rate is the number of pregnancies resulting from the method\u2019s use over a twelve-month period.\nBarrier methods, such as condoms, cervical caps, and diaphragms, block sperm from entering the uterus, preventing\nfertilization. Spermicides are chemicals that are placed in the vagina that kill sperm. Sponges, which are saturated with\nspermicides, are placed in the vagina at the cervical opening. Combinations of spermicidal chemicals and barrier methods\nachieve lower failure rates than do the methods when used separately.\nNearly a quarter of the couples using barrier methods, natural family planning, or withdrawal can expect a failure of the\nmethod. Natural family planning is based on the monitoring of the menstrual cycle and having intercourse only during times\nwhen the egg is not available. A woman\u2019s body temperature may rise a degree Celsius at ovulation and the cervical mucus may\nincrease in volume and become more pliable. These changes give a general indication of when intercourse is more or less likely\nto result in fertilization. Withdrawal involves the removal of the penis from the vagina during intercourse, before ejaculation\noccurs. This is a risky method with a high failure rate due to the possible presence of sperm in the bulbourethral gland\u2019s\nsecretion, which may enter the vagina prior to removing the penis.\nHormonal methods use synthetic progesterone (sometimes in combination with estrogen), to inhibit the hypothalamus from\nreleasing FSH or LH, and thus prevent an egg from being available for fertilization. The method of administering the hormone\naffects failure rate. The most reliable method, with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, is the implantation of the hormone under\nthe skin. The same rate can be achieved through the sterilization procedures of vasectomy in the man or of tubal ligation in the\nwoman, or by using an intrauterine device (IUD). IUDs are inserted into the uterus and establish an inflammatory condition\nthat prevents fertilized eggs from implanting into the uterine wall.\nCompliance with the contraceptive method is a strong contributor to the success or failure rate of any particular method. The\nonly method that is completely effective at preventing conception is abstinence. The choice of contraceptive method depends on\nthe goals of the woman or couple. Tubal ligation and vasectomy are considered permanent prevention, while other methods are\n43.5 \u2022 Human Pregnancy and Birth\n1247\nreversible and provide short-term contraception.\nTermination of an existing pregnancy can be spontaneous or voluntary. Spontaneous termination is a miscarriage and usually\noccurs very early in the pregnancy, usually within the first few weeks. This occurs when the fetus cannot develop properly and\nthe gestation is naturally terminated. Voluntary termination of a pregnancy is an abortion. Laws regulating abortion vary\nbetween states and tend to view fetal viability as the criteria for allowing or preventing the procedure.\nInfertility\nInfertility is the inability to conceive a child or carry a child to birth. About 75 percent of causes of infertility can be identified;\nthese include diseases, such as sexually transmitted diseases that can cause scarring of the reproductive tubes in either men or\nwomen, or developmental problems frequently related to abnormal hormone levels in one of the individuals. Inadequate\nnutrition, especially starvation, can delay menstruation. Stress can also lead to infertility. Short-term stress can affect hormone\nlevels, while long-term stress can delay puberty and cause less frequent menstrual cycles. Other factors that affect fertility\ninclude toxins (such as cadmium), tobacco smoking, marijuana use, gonadal injuries, and aging.\nIf infertility is identified, several assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are available to aid conception. A common type of\nART is in vitro fertilization (IVF) where an egg and sperm are combined outside the body and then placed in the uterus. Eggs are\nobtained from the woman after extensive hormonal treatments that prepare mature eggs for fertilization and prepare the uterus\nfor implantation of the fertilized egg. Sperm are obtained from the man and they are combined with the eggs and supported\nthrough several cell divisions to ensure viability of the zygotes. When the embryos have reached the eight-cell stage, one or more\nis implanted into the woman\u2019s uterus. If fertilization is not accomplished by simple IVF, a procedure that injects the sperm into\nan egg can be used. This is called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and is shown in Figure 43.22. IVF procedures produce\na surplus of fertilized eggs and embryos that can be frozen and stored for future use. The procedures can also result in multiple\nbirths.\nFigure 43.22 A sperm is inserted into an egg for fertilization during intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

The early stages of embryonic development are also crucial for ensuring the fitness of the organism.\nFertilization\nFertilization, pictured in Figure 43.23a is the process in which gametes (an egg and sperm) fuse to form a zygote. The egg and\nsperm each contain one set of chromosomes. To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes,\n1248\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nonly one sperm must fuse with one egg. In mammals, the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of\nglycoproteins called the zona pellucida. When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, a series of biochemical events, called the\nacrosomal reactions, take place. In placental mammals, the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation\nof the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane,\nas illustrated in Figure 43.23b. The fusion of these two membranes creates an opening through which the sperm nucleus is\ntransferred into the ovum. The nuclear membranes of the egg and sperm break down and the two haploid genomes condense to\nform a diploid genome.\nFigure 43.23 (a) Fertilization is the process in which sperm and egg fuse to form a zygote. (b) Acrosomal reactions help the sperm degrade\nthe glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allow the sperm to transfer its nucleus. (credit: (b) modification of work by Mariana Ruiz\nVillareal; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\nTo ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg, once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg\nmembrane, the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg. If this mechanism\nfails, multiple sperm can fuse with the egg, resulting in polyspermy. The resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies\nwithin a few days.\nCleavage and Blastula Stage\nThe development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to form the\nblastula. The rapid, multiple rounds of cell division are termed cleavage. Cleavage is illustrated in (Figure 43.24a). After the\ncleavage has produced over 100 cells, the embryo is called a blastula. The blastula is usually a spherical layer of cells (the\nblastoderm) surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel). Mammals at this stage form a structure called the\nblastocyst, characterized by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula, shown in Figure 43.24b. During\ncleavage, the cells divide without an increase in mass; that is, one large single-celled zygote divides into multiple smaller cells.\nEach cell within the blastula is called a blastomere.\nFigure 43.24 (a) During cleavage, the zygote rapidly divides into multiple cells without increasing in size. (b) The cells rearrange themselves\nto form a hollow ball with a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity called the blastula.\nCleavage can take place in two ways: holoblastic (total) cleavage or meroblastic (partial) cleavage. The type of cleavage depends\non the amount of yolk in the eggs. In placental mammals (including humans) where nourishment is provided by the mother\u2019s\nbody, the eggs have a very small amount of yolk and undergo holoblastic cleavage. Other species, such as birds, with a lot of yolk\nin the egg to nourish the embryo during development, undergo meroblastic cleavage.\nIn mammals, the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development. Here the cells in the blastula arrange\nthemselves in two layers: the inner cell mass, and an outer layer called the trophoblast. The inner cell mass is also known as the\nembryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo. At this stage of development, illustrated in Figure 43.25 the\n43.6 \u2022 Fertilization and Early Embryonic Development\n1249\ninner cell mass consists of embryonic stem cells that will differentiate into the different cell types needed by the organism. The\ntrophoblast will contribute to the placenta and nourish the embryo.\nFigure 43.25 The rearrangement of the cells in the mammalian blastula to two layers\u2014the inner cell mass and the trophoblast\u2014results in\nthe formation of the blastocyst.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit the Virtual Human Embryo project (http://openstax.org/l/human_embryo) at the Endowment for Human Development\nsite to step through an interactive that shows the stages of embryo development, including micrographs and rotating 3-D\nimages.\nGastrulation\nThe typical blastula is a ball of cells. The next stage in embryonic development is the formation of the body plan. The cells in the\nblastula rearrange themselves spatially to form three layers of cells. This process is called gastrulation. During gastrulation, the\nblastula folds upon itself to form the three layers of cells. Each of these layers is called a germ layer and each germ layer\ndifferentiates into different organ systems.\nThe three germ layers, shown in Figure 43.26, are the endoderm, the ectoderm, and the mesoderm. The ectoderm gives rise to\nthe nervous system and the epidermis. The mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body. The\nendoderm gives rise to columnar cells found in the digestive system and many internal organs.\nFigure 43.26 The three germ layers give rise to different cell types in the animal body.

Would you select the sex of your\nchild or select for their attractiveness, strength, or intelligence? How far would you go to maximize the possibility of\nresistance to disease? The genetic engineering of a human child, the production of \"designer babies\" with desirable\nphenotypic characteristics, was once a topic restricted to science fiction. This is the case no longer: science fiction is now\noverlapping into science fact. Many phenotypic choices for offspring are already available, with many more likely to be\npossible in the not too distant future. Which traits should be selected and how they should be selected are topics of much\ndebate within the worldwide medical community. The ethical and moral line is not always clear or agreed upon, and some\nfear that modern reproductive technologies could lead to a new form of eugenics.\nEugenics is the use of information and technology from a variety of sources to improve the genetic makeup of the human\nrace. The goal of creating genetically superior humans was quite prevalent (although controversial) in several countries\nduring the early 20th century, but fell into disrepute when Nazi Germany developed an extensive eugenics program in the\n1930s and 40s. As part of their program, the Nazis forcibly sterilized hundreds of thousands of the so-called \"unfit\" and\nkilled tens of thousands of institutionally disabled people as part of a systematic program to develop a genetically superior\nrace of Germans known as Aryans. Ever since, eugenic ideas have not been as publicly expressed, but there are still those\nwho promote them.\nEfforts have been made in the past to control traits in human children using donated sperm from men with desired traits.\nIn fact, eugenicist Robert Klark Graham established a sperm bank in 1980 that included samples exclusively from donors\nwith high IQs. The \"genius\" sperm bank failed to capture the public's imagination and the operation closed in 1999.\nIn more recent times, the procedure known as prenatal genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been developed. PGD involves the\nscreening of human embryos as part of the process of in vitro fertilization, during which embryos are conceived and grown\noutside the mother's body for some period of time before they are implanted. The term PGD usually refers to both the\ndiagnosis, selection, and the implantation of the selected embryos.\nIn the least controversial use of PGD, embryos are tested for the presence of alleles which cause genetic diseases such as\nsickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, and hemophilia, in which a single disease-causing allele or pair of alleles has been\nidentified. By excluding embryos containing these alleles from implantation into the mother, the disease is prevented, and\nthe unused embryos are either donated to science or discarded. There are relatively few in the worldwide medical\ncommunity that question the ethics of this type of procedure, which allows individuals scared to have children because of\nthe alleles they carry to do so successfully. The major limitation to this procedure is its expense. Not usually covered by\nmedical insurance and thus out of reach financially for most couples, only a very small percentage of all live births use such\ncomplicated methodologies. Yet, even in cases like these where the ethical issues may seem to be clear-cut, not everyone\nagrees with the morality of these types of procedures. For example, to those who take the position that human life begins at\n43.6 \u2022 Fertilization and Early Embryonic Development\n1251\n43.7 Organogenesis and Vertebrate Formation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe the process of organogenesis\n\u2022\nIdentify the anatomical axes formed in vertebrates\nGastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise, during further development, to the different organs\nin the animal body. This process is called organogenesis. Organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements of the\ncells within the embryo.\nOrganogenesis\nOrgans form from the germ layers through the process of differentiation. During differentiation, the embryonic stem cells\nexpress specific sets of genes which will determine their ultimate cell type. For example, some cells in the ectoderm will express\nthe genes specific to skin cells. As a result, these cells will differentiate into epidermal cells. The process of differentiation is\nregulated by cellular signaling cascades.\nScientists study organogenesis extensively in the lab in fruit flies (Drosophila) and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.\nDrosophila have segments along their bodies, and the patterning associated with the segment formation has allowed scientists\nto study which genes play important roles in organogenesis along the length of the embryo at different time points. The\nnematode C.elegans has roughly 1000 somatic cells and scientists have studied the fate of each of these cells during their\ndevelopment in the nematode life cycle. There is little variation in patterns of cell lineage between individuals, unlike in\nmammals where cell development from the embryo is dependent on cellular cues.\nIn vertebrates, one of the primary steps during organogenesis is the formation of the neural system. The ectoderm forms\nepithelial cells and tissues, and neuronal tissues. During the formation of the neural system, special signaling molecules called\ngrowth factors signal some cells at the edge of the ectoderm to become epidermis cells. The remaining cells in the center form\nthe neural plate. If the signaling by growth factors were disrupted, then the entire ectoderm would differentiate into neural\ntissue.\nThe neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube, as illustrated in\nFigure 43.28. In further development, the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord.\nconception, the discarding of unused embryos, a necessary result of PGD, is unacceptable under any circumstances.\nA murkier ethical situation is found in the selection of a child's sex, which is easily performed by PGD. Currently, countries\nsuch as Great Britain have banned the selection of a child's sex for reasons other than preventing sex-linked diseases. Other\ncountries allow the procedure for \"family balancing\", based on the desire of some parents to have at least one child of each\nsex. Still others, including the United States, have taken a scattershot approach to regulating these practices, essentially\nleaving it to the individual practicing physician to decide which practices are acceptable and which are not.\nEven murkier are rare instances of disabled parents, such as those with deafness or dwarfism, who select embryos via PGD\nto ensure that they share their disability. These parents usually cite many positive aspects of their disabilities and associated\nculture as reasons for their choice, which they see as their moral right. To others, to purposely cause a disability in a child\nviolates the basic medical principle of Primum non nocere, \"first, do no harm.\" This procedure, although not illegal in most\ncountries, demonstrates the complexity of ethical issues associated with choosing genetic traits in offspring.\nWhere could this process lead? Will this technology become more affordable and how should it be used? With the ability of\ntechnology to progress rapidly and unpredictably, a lack of definitive guidelines for the use of reproductive technologies\nbefore they arise might make it difficult for legislators to keep pace once they are in fact realized, assuming the process\nneeds any government regulation at all. Other bioethicists argue that we should only deal with technologies that exist now,\nand not in some uncertain future. They argue that these types of procedures will always be expensive and rare, so the fears\nof eugenics and \"master\" races are unfounded and overstated. The debate continues.\n1252\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 43.28 The central region of the ectoderm forms the neural tube, which gives rise to the brain and the spinal cord.\nThe mesoderm that lies on either side of the vertebrate neural tube will develop into the various connective tissues of the animal\nbody. A spatial pattern of gene expression reorganizes the mesoderm into groups of cells called somites with spaces between\nthem. The somites illustrated in Figure 43.29 will further develop into the cells that form the vertebrae and ribs, the dermis of\nthe dorsal skin, the skeletal muscles of the back, and the skeletal muscles of the body wall and limbs. The mesoderm also forms a\nstructure called the notochord, which is rod-shaped and forms the central axis of the animal body.\n43.7 \u2022 Organogenesis and Vertebrate Formation\n1253\nFigure 43.29 In this five-week old human embryo, somites are segments along the length of the body. (credit: modification of work by Ed\nUthman)\nVertebrate Axis Formation\nEven as the germ layers form, the ball of cells still retains its spherical shape. However, animal bodies have lateral-medial (left-\nright), dorsal-ventral (back-belly), and anterior-posterior (head-feet) axes, illustrated in Figure 43.30.\nFigure 43.30 Animal bodies have three axes for symmetry. (credit: modification of work by NOAA)\nHow are these established? In one of the most seminal experiments ever to be carried out in developmental biology, Spemann\nand Mangold took dorsal cells from one embryo and transplanted them into the belly region of another embryo. They found that\nthe transplanted embryo now had two notochords: one at the dorsal site from the original cells and another at the transplanted\nsite. This suggested that the dorsal cells were genetically programmed to form the notochord and define the axis. Since then,\nresearchers have identified many genes that are responsible for axis formation. Mutations in these genes leads to the loss of\nsymmetry required for organism development.\nAnimal bodies have externally visible symmetry. However, the internal organs are not symmetric. For example, the heart is on\nthe left side and the liver on the right. The formation of the central left-right axis is an important process during development.\nThis internal asymmetry is established very early during development and involves many genes. Research is still ongoing to fully\n1254\nChapter 43 \u2022 Animal Reproduction and Development\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nunderstand the developmental implications of these genes.\n43.7 \u2022 Organogenesis and Vertebrate Formation\n1255\n", "key_terms": "\nacrosomal reaction\nseries of biochemical reactions that the\nsperm uses to break through the zona pellucida\nasexual reproduction\nform of reproduction that produces\noffspring that are genetically identical to the parent\nblastocyst\nstructure formed when cells in the mammalian\nblastula separate into an inner and outer layer\nbudding\nform of asexual reproduction that results from the\noutgrowth of a part of a cell leading to a separation from\nthe original animal into two individuals\nbulbourethral gland\nsecretion that cleanses the urethra\nprior to ejaculation\nclitoris\nsensory structure in females;

Asexual reproduction occurs\nthrough fission, budding, and fragmentation. Sexual\nreproduction may mean the joining of sperm and eggs\nwithin animals\u2019 bodies or it may mean the release of sperm\nand eggs into the environment. An individual may be one\nsex, or both; it may start out as one sex and switch during its\nlife, or it may stay male or female.\n43.2 Fertilization\nSexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm\nand an egg in a process called fertilization. This can occur\neither outside the bodies or inside the female. Both methods\nhave advantages and disadvantages. Once fertilized, the eggs\ncan develop inside the female or outside. If the egg develops\noutside the body, it usually has a protective covering over it.\nAnimal anatomy evolved various ways to fertilize, hold, or\nexpel the egg. The method of fertilization varies among\nanimals. Some species release the egg and sperm into the\nenvironment, some species retain the egg and receive the\nsperm into the female body and then expel the developing\nembryo covered with shell, while still other species retain the\ndeveloping offspring through the gestation period.\n43.3 Human Reproductive Anatomy\nand Gametogenesis\nAs animals became more complex, specific organs and organ\nsystems developed to support specific functions for the\norganism. The reproductive structures that evolved in land\nanimals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally,\nand support the growth and development of offspring.\nProcesses developed to produce reproductive cells that had\nexactly half the number of chromosomes of each parent so\nthat new combinations would have the appropriate amount\nof genetic material. Gametogenesis, the production of sperm\n(spermatogenesis) and eggs (oogenesis), takes place through\nthe process of meiosis.\n43.4 Hormonal Control of Human\nReproduction\nThe male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by\nhormones released from the hypothalamus and anterior\npituitary as well as hormones from reproductive tissues and\norgans. The hypothalamus monitors the need for the FSH\nand LH hormones made and released from the anterior\npituitary. FSH and LH affect reproductive structures to cause\nthe formation of sperm and the preparation of eggs for\nrelease and possible fertilization. In the male, FSH and LH\nstimulate Sertoli cells and interstitial cells of Leydig in the\ntestes to facilitate sperm production. The Leydig cells\nproduce testosterone, which also is responsible for the\nsecondary sexual characteristics of males. In females, FSH\nand LH cause estrogen and progesterone to be produced.\nThey regulate the female reproductive system which is\ndivided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle.\nMenopause occurs when the ovaries lose their sensitivity to\nFSH and LH and the female reproductive cycles slow to a\nstop.\n43.5 Human Pregnancy and Birth\nHuman pregnancy begins with fertilization of an egg and\nproceeds through the three trimesters of gestation. The labor\nprocess has three stages (contractions, delivery of the fetus,\nexpulsion of the placenta), each propelled by hormones. The\nfirst trimester lays down the basic structures of the body,\nincluding the limb buds, heart, eyes, and the liver. The\nsecond trimester continues the development of all of the\norgans and systems. The third trimester exhibits the greatest\ngrowth of the fetus and culminates in labor and delivery.\nPrevention of a pregnancy can be accomplished through a\nvariety of methods including barriers, hormones, or other\nmeans. Assisted reproductive technologies may help\nindividuals who have infertility problems.\nChapter 43 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n1257\n43.6 Fertilization and Early\nEmbryonic Development\nThe early stages of embryonic development begin with\nfertilization. The process of fertilization is tightly controlled\nto ensure that only one sperm fuses with one egg. After\nfertilization, the zygote undergoes cleavage to form the\nblastula. The blastula, which in some species is a hollow ball\nof cells, undergoes a process called gastrulation, in which the\nthree germ layers form. The ectoderm gives rise to the\nnervous system and the epidermal skin cells, the mesoderm\ngives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the\nbody, and the endoderm gives rise to columnar cells and\ninternal organs.\n43.7 Organogenesis and Vertebrate\nFormation\nOrganogenesis is the formation of organs from the germ\nlayers. Each germ layer gives rise to specific tissue types. The\nfirst stage is the formation of the neural system in the\nectoderm. The mesoderm gives rise to somites and the\nnotochord. Formation of vertebrate axis is another\nimportant developmental stage.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

Perhaps you are interested in learning about the natural world\nand how living things have adapted to the physical conditions of their environment. Or, perhaps you\u2019re a\nfuture physician seeking to understand the connection between your patients' health and their\nenvironment.\nHumans are a part of the ecological landscape, and human health is one important part of human\ninteraction with our physical and living environment. Lyme disease, for instance, serves as one modern-\nday example of the connection between our health and the natural world (Figure 44.1). More formally\nknown as Lyme borreliosis, Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can be transmitted to humans\nwhen they are bitten by the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis in the eastern U.S., and Ixodes pacificus along\nthe Pacific coast). Deer ticks are the primary vectors (a vector is an organism that transmits a pathogen)\nfor this disease. However, not all ticks carry the pathogen, and not all deer ticks carry the bacteria that\nwill cause Lyme disease in humans. Also, the ticks I. scapularis and pacificus can have other hosts\nbesides deer. In fact, it turns out that the probability of infection depends on the type of host upon which\nthe tick develops: a higher proportion of ticks that live on white-footed mice carry the bacterium than do\nticks that live on deer. Knowledge about the environments and population densities in which the host\nspecies is abundant would help a physician or an epidemiologist better understand how Lyme disease is\ntransmitted and how its incidence could be reduced.\nChapter Outline\n44.1 The Scope of\nEcology\n44.2 Biogeography\n44.3 Terrestrial Biomes\n44.4 Aquatic Biomes\n44.5 Climate and the\nEffects of Global\nClimate Change\n44.1 The Scope of Ecology\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDefine ecology and the four basic levels of ecological research\n\u2022\nDescribe examples of the ways in which ecology requires the integration of different\nscientific disciplines\n\u2022\nDistinguish between abiotic and biotic components of the environment\n\u2022\nRecognize the relationship between abiotic and biotic components of the environment\nEcology is the study of the interactions of living organisms with their environment. One core goal of ecology\nis to understand the distribution and abundance of living things in the physical environment. Attainment of\nthis goal requires the integration of scientific disciplines inside and outside of biology, such as mathematics,\nstatistics, biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, evolution, biodiversity, geology, and climatology.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClimate change can alter where organisms live, which can sometimes directly affect human health. Watch\nthe PBS video \u201cFeeling the Effects of Climate Change\u201d (http://openstax.org/l/climate_health) in which\nresearchers discover a pathogenic organism living far outside of its normal range.\nLevels of Ecological Study\nWhen a discipline such as biology is studied, it is often helpful to subdivide it into smaller, related areas. For\ninstance, cell biologists interested in cell signaling need to understand the chemistry of the signal molecules\n(which are usually proteins) as well as the result of cell signaling. Ecologists interested in the factors that\ninfluence the survival of an endangered species might use mathematical models to predict how current\nconservation efforts affect endangered organisms.\nTo produce a sound set of management options, a conservation biologist needs to collect accurate data,\nincluding current population size, factors affecting reproduction (like physiology and behavior), habitat\nrequirements (such as plants and soils), and potential human influences on the endangered population and\nits habitat (which might be derived through studies in sociology and urban ecology). Within the discipline of\necology, researchers work at four general levels, which sometimes overlap. These levels are organism,\npopulation, community, and ecosystem (Figure 44.2).\nFigure 44.2 Ecologists study within several biological levels of organization.

These adaptations can be morphological, physiological, and behavioral. For instance, the Karner blue butterfly\n(Lycaeides melissa samuelis) (Figure 44.3) is considered a specialist because the females only oviposit (that is, lay eggs) on wild\nlupine (Lupinus perennis). This specific requirement and adaptation means that the Karner blue butterfly is completely\ndependent on the presence of wild lupine plants for its survival.\nFigure 44.3 The Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) is a rare butterfly that lives only in open areas with few trees or shrubs,\nsuch as pine barrens and oak savannas. It can only lay its eggs on lupine plants. (credit: modification of work by J & K Hollingsworth,\nUSFWS)\nAfter hatching, the (first instar) caterpillars emerge and spend four to six weeks feeding solely on wild lupine (Figure 44.4). The\ncaterpillars pupate as a chrysalis to undergo the final stage of metamorphosis and emerge as butterflies after about four weeks.\nThe adult butterflies feed on the nectar of flowers of wild lupine and other plant species, such as milkweeds. Generally there are\ntwo broods of the Karner blue each year.\nA researcher interested in studying Karner blue butterflies at the organismal level might, in addition to asking questions about\negg laying requirements, ask questions about the butterflies\u2019 preferred thoracic flight temperature (a physiological question), or\nthe behavior of the caterpillars when they are at different larval stages (a behavioral question).\n44.1 \u2022 The Scope of Ecology\n1263\nFigure 44.4 The wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) is the only known host plant for the Karner blue butterfly.\nPopulation Ecology\nA population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members of the same species living in the same area at the same\ntime. (Organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics.) A population is identified, in part, by where\nit lives, and its area of population may have natural or artificial boundaries. Natural boundaries might be rivers, mountains, or\ndeserts, while artificial boundaries may be mowed grass, manmade structures, or roads. The study of population ecology\nfocuses on the number of individuals in an area and how and why population size changes over time.\nFor example, population ecologists are particularly interested in counting the Karner blue butterfly because it is classified as a\nfederally endangered species. However, the distribution and density of this species is highly influenced by the distribution and\nabundance of wild lupine, and the biophysical environment around it. Researchers might ask questions about the factors\nleading to the decline of wild lupine and how these affect Karner blue butterflies. For example, ecologists know that wild lupine\nthrives in open areas where trees and shrubs are largely absent. In natural settings, intermittent wildfires regularly remove trees\nand shrubs, helping to maintain the open areas that wild lupine requires. Mathematical models can be used to understand how\nwildfire suppression by humans has led to the decline of this important plant for the Karner blue butterfly.\nCommunity Ecology\nA biological community consists of the different species within an area, typically a three-dimensional space, and the\ninteractions within and among these species. Community ecologists are interested in the processes driving these interactions\nand their consequences. Questions about conspecific interactions often focus on competition among members of the same\nspecies for a limited resource. Ecologists also study interactions between various species; members of different species are\ncalled heterospecifics. Examples of heterospecific interactions include predation, parasitism, herbivory, competition, and\npollination. These interactions can have regulating effects on population sizes and can impact ecological and evolutionary\nprocesses affecting diversity.\nFor example, Karner blue butterfly larvae form mutualistic relationships with ants (especially Formica spp). Mutualism is a form\nof long-term relationship that has coevolved between two species and from which each species benefits. For mutualism to exist\nbetween individual organisms, each species must receive some benefit from the other as a consequence of the relationship.\nResearchers have shown that there is an increase in survival when ants protect Karner blue butterfly larvae (caterpillars) from\npredaceous insects and spiders, an act known as \u201ctending.\u201d This might be because the larvae spend less time in each life stage\nwhen tended by ants, which provides an advantage for the larvae. Meanwhile, to attract the ants, the Karner blue butterfly larvae\nsecrete ant-like pheromones and a carbohydrate-rich substance that is an important energy source for the ants. Both the Karner\nblue larvae and the ants benefit from their interaction, although the species of attendant ants may be partially opportunistic and\n1264\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nvary over the range of the butterfly.\nEcosystem Ecology\nEcosystem ecology is an extension of organismal, population, and community ecology. The ecosystem is composed of all the\nbiotic components (living things) in an area along with the abiotic components (nonliving things) of that area. Some of the\nabiotic components include air, water, and soil. Ecosystem biologists ask questions about how nutrients and energy are stored\nand how they move among organisms and through the surrounding atmosphere, soil, and water.\nThe Karner blue butterflies and the wild lupine live in an oak-pine barren habitat. This habitat is characterized by natural\ndisturbance and nutrient-poor soils that are low in nitrogen. The availability of nutrients is an important factor in the\ndistribution of the plants that live in this habitat. Researchers interested in ecosystem ecology could ask questions about the\nimportance of limited resources and the movement of resources, such as nutrients, though the biotic and abiotic portions of the\necosystem.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nEcologist\nA career in ecology contributes to many facets of human society. Understanding ecological issues can help society meet the basic\nhuman needs of food, shelter, and health care. Ecologists can conduct their research in the laboratory and outside in natural\nenvironments (Figure 44.5). These natural environments can be as close to home as the stream running through your campus or\nas far away as the hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Ecologists manage natural resources such as white-\ntailed deer populations (Odocoileus virginianus) for hunting or aspen (Populus spp.) timber stands for paper production.\nEcologists also work as educators who teach children and adults at various institutions including universities, high schools,\nmuseums, and nature centers. Ecologists may also work in advisory positions assisting local, state, and federal policymakers to\ndevelop laws that are ecologically sound, or they may develop those policies and legislation themselves. To become an ecologist\nrequires at least an undergraduate degree, usually in a natural science. The undergraduate degree is often followed by\nspecialized training or an advanced degree, depending on the area of ecology selected. Ecologists should also have a broad\nbackground in the physical sciences, as well as a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics.\nFigure 44.5 This landscape ecologist is releasing a black-footed ferret into its native habitat as part of a study. (credit: USFWS Mountain\nPrairie Region, NPS)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/ecologist_role) to see Stephen Wing, a marine ecologist from the University of Otago,\ndiscuss the role of an ecologist and the types of issues ecologists explore.\n44.1 \u2022 The Scope of Ecology\n1265\n44.2 Biogeography\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDefine biogeography\n\u2022\nList and describe abiotic factors that affect the global distribution of plant and animal species\n\u2022\nCompare the impact of abiotic forces on aquatic and terrestrial environments\n\u2022\nSummarize the effects of abiotic factors on net primary productivity\nMany forces influence the communities of living organisms present in different parts of the biosphere (all of the parts of Earth\ninhabited by life). The biosphere extends into the atmosphere (several kilometers above Earth) and into the depths of the oceans.\nDespite its apparent vastness to an individual human, the biosphere occupies only a minute space when compared to the known\nuniverse. Many abiotic forces influence where life can exist and the types of organisms found in different parts of the biosphere.\nThe abiotic factors influence the distribution of biomes: large areas of land with similar climate, flora, and fauna.\nBiogeography\nBiogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution.\nAbiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation. As these abiotic factors change, the\ncomposition of plant and animal communities also changes. For example, if you were to begin a journey at the equator and walk\nnorth, you would notice gradual changes in plant communities. At the beginning of your journey, you would see tropical wet\nforests with broad-leaved evergreen trees, which are characteristic of plant communities found near the equator. As you\ncontinued to travel north, you would see these broad-leaved evergreen plants eventually give rise to seasonally dry forests with\nscattered trees. You would also begin to notice changes in temperature and moisture. At about 30 degrees north, these forests\nwould give way to deserts, which are characterized by low precipitation and high insolation (sunlight).\nMoving farther north, you would see that deserts are replaced by grasslands or prairies. Eventually, grasslands are replaced by\ndeciduous temperate forests. These deciduous forests give way to the boreal forests and taiga found in the subarctic, the area\nsouth of the Arctic Circle. Finally, you would reach the Arctic tundra, which is found at the most northern latitudes. This trek\nnorth reveals gradual changes in both climate and the types of organisms that have adapted to environmental factors associated\nwith ecosystems found at different latitudes. However, different ecosystems exist at the same latitude due in part to abiotic\nfactors such as jet streams, the Gulf Stream, and ocean currents. If you were to hike up a mountain, the changes you would see\nin the vegetation would parallel in many ways those as you move to higher latitudes.\nEcologists who study biogeography examine patterns of species distribution. No species exists everywhere; for example, the\nVenus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is endemic to a small area in North and South Carolina. An endemic species is one which is\nnaturally found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size. Other species are generalists: species which\nlive in a wide variety of geographic areas; the raccoon (Procyon spp) for example, is native to most of North and Central America.\nSpecies distribution patterns are based on biotic and abiotic factors and their influences during the very long periods of time\nrequired for species evolution; therefore, early studies of biogeography were closely linked to the emergence of evolutionary\nthinking in the eighteenth century. Some of the most distinctive assemblages of plants and animals occur in regions that have\nbeen physically separated for millions of years by geographic barriers. Biologists estimate that Australia, for example, has\nbetween 600,000 and 700,000 species of plants and animals. Approximately 3/4 of living plant and mammal species are\nendemic species found solely in Australia (Figure 44.6ab).\n1266\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 44.6 Australia is home to many endemic species. The (a) wallaby (Wallabia bicolor), a medium-sized member of the kangaroo family,\nis a pouched mammal, or marsupial. The (b) echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is an egg-laying mammal. (credit a: modification of work by\nDerrick Coetzee; credit b: modification of work by Allan Whittome)\nSometimes ecologists discover unique patterns of species distribution by determining where species are not found. Despite\nbeing tropical, Hawaii, for example, has no native land species of reptiles or amphibians, only a few native species of butterflies,\nand only one native terrestrial mammal, the hoary bat. Most of New Guinea, as another example, lacks placental mammals.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCheck out this video (http://openstax.org/l/platypus) to observe a platypus swimming in its natural habitat in New South Wales,\nAustralia.\nLike animals, plants can be endemic or generalists: endemic plants are found only on specific regions of the Earth, while\ngeneralists are found on many regions. Isolated land masses\u2014such as Australia, Hawaii, and Madagascar\u2014often have large\nnumbers of endemic plant species. Some of these plants are endangered due to human activity. The forest gardenia (Gardenia\nbrighamii), for instance, is endemic to Hawaii; only an estimated 15\u201320 trees are thought to exist (Figure 44.7).\nFigure 44.7 Listed as federally endangered, the forest gardenia is a small tree with distinctive flowers. It is found only in five of the\nHawaiian Islands in small populations consisting of a few individual specimens. (credit: Forest & Kim Starr)\nEnergy Sources\nEnergy from the sun is captured by green plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and photosynthetic protists. These organisms convert\nsolar energy into the chemical energy needed by all living things. Light availability can be an important force directly affecting\nthe evolution of adaptations in photosynthesizers. For instance, plants in the understory of a temperate forest are shaded when\n44.2 \u2022 Biogeography\n1267\nthe trees above them in the canopy completely leaf out in the late spring. Not surprisingly, understory plants have adaptations to\nsuccessfully capture available light that passes through the canopy. One such adaptation is the rapid growth of spring ephemeral\nplants such as the spring beauty (Claytonia virginica) (Figure 44.8). These spring flowers achieve much of their growth and finish\ntheir life cycle (reproduce) early in the season before the trees in the canopy develop leaves.\nFigure 44.8 The spring beauty is an ephemeral spring plant that flowers early in the spring to avoid competing with larger forest trees for\nsunlight. (credit: John Beetham)\nIn aquatic ecosystems, the availability of light may be limited because sunlight is absorbed by water, plants, suspended particles,\nand resident microorganisms. Toward the bottom of a lake, pond, or ocean, there is a zone that light cannot reach (because most\nwavelengths except for the shortest blues are absorbed by the water column). Photosynthesis cannot take place there and, as a\nresult, a number of adaptations have evolved that enable living things to survive without light. For instance, aquatic plants have\nphotosynthetic tissue near the surface of the water. You can think of the broad, floating leaves of a water lily\u2014water lilies cannot\nsurvive without light. In environments such as hydrothermal vents, some bacteria extract energy from inorganic chemicals\nbecause there is no light for photosynthesis.\nThe availability of nutrients in aquatic systems such as oceans is also an important aspect of energy or photosynthesis. Many\norganisms sink to the bottom of the ocean when they die in the open water; when this occurs, the energy found in that living\norganism is sequestered for some time unless ocean upwelling occurs. Ocean upwelling is the rising of deep ocean waters that\noccurs when prevailing winds blow along surface waters near a coastline (Figure 44.9). As the wind pushes ocean waters\noffshore, water from the bottom of the ocean moves up to replace this water. As a result, the nutrients once contained in dead\norganisms become available for reuse by other living organisms.\n1268\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 44.9 Ocean upwelling is an important process that recycles nutrients and energy in the ocean. As wind (green arrows) pushes\noffshore, it causes water from the ocean bottom (red arrows) to move to the surface, bringing up nutrients from the ocean depths.\nIn freshwater systems, such as lakes, the recycling of nutrients occurs in response to air temperature and wind changes. The\nnutrients at the bottom of lakes are recycled twice each year: in the spring and fall turnover. The spring-and-fall turnover are\nseasonal processes that recycle nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater lake to the top of the lake (Figure 44.10).\nThese turnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline: layers of water with temperatures that are significantly different\nfrom those above and below it.\nIn wintertime, the surface of lakes found in many northern regions is frozen. However, the water under the ice is slightly\nwarmer, and the water at the bottom of the lake is warmer yet at 4 \u00b0C to 5 \u00b0C (39.2 \u00b0F to 41 \u00b0F). Water is densest at about 4 \u00b0C;\ntherefore, the deepest water is also the densest. The deepest water is oxygen-poor because the decomposition of organic\nmaterial at the bottom of the lake uses up available oxygen that cannot be replaced by means of oxygen diffusion into the surface\nof the water, due to the surface ice layer.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 44.10 The spring and fall turnovers are important processes in freshwater lakes that act to move the nutrients and oxygen at the\nbottom of deep lakes to the top. Turnover occurs because water has a maximum density at 4 \u00b0C. Surface water temperature changes as the\nseasons progress, and denser water sinks.\n44.2 \u2022 Biogeography\n1269\nHow might turnover in tropical lakes differ from turnover in lakes that exist in temperate regions? Think of the variation, or lack\nof variation, in seasonal temperature change.\nIn springtime, air temperatures increase and surface ice melts. When the temperature of the surface water begins to approach 4\n\u00b0C, the water becomes heavier and sinks to the bottom. The water at the bottom of the lake is then displaced by the heavier and\ndenser surface water and, thus, rises to the top. As that water rises to the top, the sediments and nutrients from the lake bottom\nare brought along with it. This is called the spring turnover. During the summer months, the lake water stratifies, or forms\nlayers, with the warmest water at the lake surface.\nAs air temperatures drop in the fall, the temperature of the lake water cools to 4 \u00b0C; therefore, this causes fall turnover as the\nheavy cold water sinks and displaces the water at the bottom. The oxygen-rich water at the surface of the lake then moves to the\nbottom of the lake, while the nutrients at the bottom of the lake rise to the surface (Figure 44.10). During the winter, the oxygen\nat the bottom of the lake is used by decomposers and other organisms requiring oxygen, such as fish. It is important to note,\nhowever, that the relative transparency of ice also allows the penetration of the shorter wavelengths of visible light so that\nphotosynthesis, especially by algae can continue.\nTemperature\nTemperature affects the physiology of organisms as well as the density and state of water. Temperature exerts an important\ninfluence on living things because few living things can survive at temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) due to metabolic constraints.\nIt is also rare for living things to survive at temperatures exceeding 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F); this is a reflection of evolutionary response to\ntypical temperatures near the Earth\u2019s surface. Enzymes are most efficient within a narrow and specific range of temperatures;\nenzyme degradation can occur at higher temperatures. Therefore, organisms either must maintain an internal temperature or\nthey must inhabit an environment that will keep the body within a temperature range that supports metabolism. Some animals\nhave adapted to enable their bodies to survive significant temperature fluctuations, such as seen in hibernation or reptilian\ntorpor. Similarly, some Archaea bacteria have evolved to tolerate extremely hot temperatures such as those found in the geysers\nwithin Yellowstone National Park. Such bacteria are examples of extremophiles: organisms that thrive in extreme\nenvironments.\nThe temperature (of both water and air) can limit the distribution of living things. Animals faced with temperature fluctuations\nmay respond with adaptations, such as migration, in order to survive. Migration, the regular movement from one place to\nanother, is an adaptation found in many animals, including many that inhabit seasonally cold climates. Migration solves\nproblems related to temperature, locating food, and finding a mate. For example, the Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) makes a\n40,000 km (24,000 mi) round-trip flight each year between its feeding grounds in the southern hemisphere and its breeding\ngrounds in the Arctic Ocean. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) live in the eastern and western United States in the\nwarmer months, where they build up enormous populations, and migrate to areas around Michoacan, Mexico as well as areas\nalong the Pacific Coast, and the southern United States in the wintertime. Some species of mammals also make migratory\nforays. Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) travel about 5,000 km (3,100 mi) each year to find food. Amphibians and reptiles are more\nlimited in their distribution because they generally lack migratory ability. Not all animals that could migrate do so: migration\ncarries risk and comes at a high-energy cost.\nSome animals hibernate or estivate to survive hostile temperatures. Hibernation enables animals to survive cold conditions,\nand estivation allows animals to survive the hostile conditions of a hot, dry climate. Animals that hibernate or estivate enter a\nstate known as torpor: a condition in which their metabolic rate is significantly lowered. This enables the animal to wait until its\nenvironment better supports its survival. Some amphibians, such as the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), have an antifreeze-like\nchemical in their cells, which retains the cells\u2019 integrity and prevents them from freezing and bursting.\nWater\nWater is required by all living things because it is critical for cellular processes. Since terrestrial organisms lose water to the\nenvironment, they have evolved many adaptations to retain water.\n\u2022\nPlants have a number of interesting features on their leaves, such as leaf hairs and a waxy cuticle, that serve to decrease the\nrate of water loss via transpiration and convection.\n\u2022\nFreshwater organisms are surrounded by water and are constantly in danger of having water rush into their cells because of\nosmosis. Many adaptations of organisms living in freshwater environments have evolved to ensure that solute\nconcentrations in their bodies remain within appropriate levels. One such adaptation is the excretion of dilute urine.\n1270\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\u2022\nMarine organisms are surrounded by water with a higher solute concentration than the organism and, thus, are in danger\nof losing water to the environment because of osmosis. These organisms have morphological and physiological adaptations\nto retain water and release solutes into the environment. For example, Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), sneeze\nout water vapor that is high in salt in order to maintain solute concentrations within an acceptable range while swimming\nin the ocean and eating marine plants.\nInorganic Nutrients and Soil\nInorganic nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are important in determining the distribution and the abundance of\nliving things. Plants obtain these inorganic nutrients from the soil when water moves into the plant through the roots.\nTherefore, soil structure (particle size of soil components), soil pH, and soil nutrient content together all play an important role\nin the distribution of plants. Animals obtain inorganic nutrients from the food they consume. Therefore, animal distributions\nare related to the distribution of what they eat. In some cases, animals will follow their food resource as it moves through the\nenvironment.\nOther Aquatic Factors\nSome abiotic factors, such as oxygen, are important in aquatic ecosystems as well as terrestrial environments. Terrestrial\nanimals obtain oxygen from the air they breathe. Oxygen availability can be an issue for organisms living at very high elevations,\nhowever, where there are fewer molecules of oxygen in the air. In aquatic systems, the concentration of dissolved oxygen is\nrelated to water temperature and the speed at which the water moves. Cold water has more dissolved oxygen than warmer\nwater. In addition, salinity, currents, and tidal changes can be important abiotic factors in aquatic ecosystems.\nOther Terrestrial Factors\nWind can be an important abiotic factor because it influences the rate of evaporation, transpiration, and convective heat loss\nfrom the surface of all organisms. The physical force of wind is also important because it can move soil, water, or other abiotic\nfactors, as well as an ecosystem\u2019s organisms.\nFire is another terrestrial factor that can be an important agent of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems. Some organisms are\nadapted to fire and, thus, require the high heat associated with fire to complete a part of their life cycle. For example, the jack\npine (Pinus banksiana) requires heat from fire for its seed cones to open (Figure 44.11). Through the burning of pine needles, fire\nadds nitrogen to the soil and limits competition by destroying undergrowth.\nFigure 44.11 The mature cones of the jack pine (Pinus banksiana) open only when exposed to high temperatures, such as during a forest\nfire. A fire is likely to kill most vegetation, so a seedling that germinates after a fire is more likely to receive ample sunlight than one that\ngerminates under normal conditions. (credit: USDA)\nAbiotic Factors Influencing Plant Growth\nTemperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic\nmatter available as food (net primary productivity). Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter\navailable as food; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular\nrespiration. In terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the above-ground biomass per\nunit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots (whose mass is very difficult to measure). This means that a\nlarge percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement. Net primary productivity is\nan important variable when considering differences in biomes. Very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground\n44.2 \u2022 Biogeography\n1271\nbiomass.\nAnnual biomass production is directly related to the abiotic components of the environment. Environments with the greatest\namount of biomass produce conditions in which photosynthesis, plant growth, and the resulting net primary productivity are\noptimized. The climate of these areas is warm and wet. Photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate, enzymes can work most\nefficiently, and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration; together, these factors lead to the maximal\namount of carbon dioxide (CO2) moving into the plant, resulting in high biomass production. The above-ground biomass\nproduces several important resources for other living things, including habitat and food. Conversely, dry and cold environments\nhave lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass. The animal communities living there will also be affected by the\ndecrease in available food.\n44.3 Terrestrial Biomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nIdentify the two major abiotic factors that determine terrestrial biomes\n\u2022\nRecognize distinguishing characteristics of each of the eight major terrestrial biomes\nThe Earth\u2019s biomes are categorized into two major groups: terrestrial and aquatic. Terrestrial biomes are based on land, while\naquatic biomes include both ocean and freshwater biomes. The eight major terrestrial biomes on Earth are each distinguished\nby characteristic temperatures and amount of precipitation. Comparing the annual totals of precipitation and fluctuations in\nprecipitation from one biome to another provides clues as to the importance of abiotic factors in the distribution of biomes.\nTemperature variation on a daily and seasonal basis is also important for predicting the geographic distribution of the biome\nand the vegetation type in the biome. The distribution of these biomes shows that the same biome can occur in geographically\ndistinct areas with similar climates (Figure 44.12).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 44.12 Each of the world\u2019s major biomes is distinguished by characteristic temperatures and amounts of precipitation. Polar ice and\nmountains are also shown.\nWhich of the following statements about biomes is false?\na.\nChaparral is dominated by shrubs.\nb.\nSavannas and temperate grasslands are dominated by grasses.\nc.\nBoreal forests are dominated by deciduous trees.\nd.\nLichens are common in the arctic tundra.\nTropical Wet Forest\nTropical wet forests are also referred to as tropical rainforests. This biome is found in equatorial regions (Figure 44.12). The\nvegetation is characterized by plants with broad leaves that fall and are replaced throughout the year. Unlike the trees of\n1272\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ndeciduous forests, the trees in this biome do not have a seasonal loss of leaves associated with variations in temperature and\nsunlight; these forests are \u201cevergreen\u201d year-round.\nThe temperature and sunlight profiles of tropical wet forests are very stable in comparison to that of other terrestrial biomes,\nwith the temperatures ranging from 20 \u00b0C to 34 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F to 93 \u00b0F). When one compares the annual temperature variation of\ntropical wet forests with that of other forest biomes, the lack of seasonal temperature variation in the tropical wet forest\nbecomes apparent. This lack of seasonality leads to year-round plant growth, rather than the seasonal (spring, summer, and fall)\ngrowth seen in other more temperate biomes. In contrast to other ecosystems, tropical ecosystems do not have long days and\nshort days during the yearly cycle. Instead, a constant daily amount of sunlight (11\u201312 hrs per day) provides more solar radiation,\nthereby, a longer period of time for plant growth.\nThe annual rainfall in tropical wet forests ranges from 125 cm to 660 cm (50\u2013200 in) with some monthly variation. While\nsunlight and temperature remain fairly consistent, annual rainfall is highly variable. Tropical wet forests typically have wet\nmonths in which there can be more than 30 cm (11\u201312 in) of precipitation, as well as dry months in which there are fewer than 10\ncm (3.5 in) of rainfall. However, the driest month of a tropical wet forest still exceeds the annual rainfall of some other biomes,\nsuch as deserts.\nTropical wet forests have high net primary productivity because the annual temperatures and precipitation values in these areas\nare ideal for plant growth. Therefore, the extensive biomass present in the tropical wet forest leads to plant communities with\nvery high species diversities (Figure 44.13). Tropical wet forests have more species of trees than any other biome; on average\nbetween 100 and 300 species of trees are present in a single hectare (2.5 acres) of South American Amazonian rain forest. One\nway to visualize this is to compare the distinctive horizontal layers within the tropical wet forest biome. On the forest floor is a\nsparse layer of plants and decaying plant matter. Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage. A layer of trees rises above\nthis understory and is topped by a closed upper canopy\u2014the uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves. Some additional\ntrees emerge through this closed upper canopy. These layers provide diverse and complex habitats for the variety of plants,\nfungi, animals, and other organisms within the tropical wet forests.\nFor example, epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants, which typically are not harmed. Epiphytes are found throughout\ntropical wet forest biomes. Many species of animals use the variety of plants and the complex structure of the tropical wet\nforests for food and shelter. Some organisms live several meters above ground and have adapted to this arboreal lifestyle.\nFigure 44.13 Tropical wet forests, such as these forests along the Madre de Dios river, Peru, near the Amazon River, have high species\ndiversity. (credit: Roosevelt Garcia)\nSavannas\nSavannas are grasslands with scattered trees, and they are located in Africa, South America, and northern Australia (Figure\n44.12). Savannas are usually hot, tropical areas with temperatures averaging from 24 \u00b0C to 29 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F to 84 \u00b0F) and an annual\nrainfall of 10\u201340 cm (3.9\u201315.7 in). Savannas have an extensive dry season; for this reason, forest trees do not grow as well as they\ndo in the tropical wet forest (or other forest biomes). As a result, within the grasses and forbs (herbaceous flowering plants) that\ndominate the savanna, there are relatively few trees (Figure 44.14). Since fire is an important source of disturbance in this biome,\nplants have evolved well-developed root systems that allow them to quickly resprout after a fire.\n44.3 \u2022 Terrestrial Biomes\n1273\nFigure 44.14 Savannas, like this one in Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in Kenya, are dominated by grasses. (credit: Christopher T. Cooper)\nSubtropical Deserts\nSubtropical deserts exist between 15\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 north and south latitude and are centered on the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn\n(Figure 44.12). This biome is very dry; in some years, evaporation exceeds precipitation. Subtropical hot deserts can have\ndaytime soil surface temperatures above 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) and nighttime temperatures approaching 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). This is largely due\nto the lack of atmospheric water. In cold deserts, temperatures can be as high as 25 \u00b0C and can drop below -30 \u00b0C (-22 \u00b0F).\nSubtropical deserts are characterized by low annual precipitation of fewer than 30 cm (12 in) with little monthly variation and\nlack of predictability in rainfall. In some cases, the annual rainfall can be as low as 2 cm (0.8 in) in subtropical deserts located in\ncentral Australia (\u201cthe Outback\u201d) and northern Africa.\nThe vegetation and low animal diversity of this biome is closely related to low and unpredictable precipitation. Very dry deserts\nlack perennial vegetation that lives from one year to the next; instead, many plants are annuals that grow quickly and reproduce\nwhen rainfall does occur, and then die. Many other plants in these areas are characterized by having a number of adaptations\nthat conserve water, such as deep roots, reduced foliage, and water-storing stems (Figure 44.15). Seed plants in the desert\nproduce seeds that can be in dormancy for extended periods between rains. Adaptations in desert animals include nocturnal\nbehavior and burrowing.\n1274\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 44.15 To reduce water loss, many desert plants have tiny leaves or no leaves at all. The leaves of ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens),\nshown here in the Sonora Desert near Gila Bend, Arizona, appear only after rainfall, and then are shed.\nChaparral\nThe chaparral is also called the scrub forest and is found in California, along the Mediterranean Sea, and along the southern\ncoast of Australia (Figure 44.12). The annual rainfall in this biome ranges from 65 cm to 75 cm (25.6\u201329.5 in), and the majority of\nthe rain falls in the winter. Summers are very dry and many chaparral plants are dormant during the summertime. The\nchaparral vegetation, shown in Figure 44.16, is dominated by shrubs adapted to periodic fires, with some plants producing seeds\nthat only germinate after a hot fire. The ashes left behind after a fire are rich in nutrients like nitrogen that fertilize the soil and\npromote plant regrowth.\nFigure 44.16 The chaparral is dominated by shrubs. (credit: Miguel Vieira)\nTemperate Grasslands\nTemperate grasslands are found throughout central North America, where they are also known as prairies; they are also in\nEurasia, where they are known as steppes (Figure 44.12). Temperate grasslands have pronounced annual fluctuations in\n44.3 \u2022 Terrestrial Biomes\n1275\ntemperature with hot summers and cold winters. The annual temperature variation produces specific growing seasons for\nplants. Plant growth is possible when temperatures are warm enough to sustain plant growth and when ample water is\navailable, which occurs in the spring, summer, and fall. During much of the winter, temperatures are low, and water, which is\nstored in the form of ice, is not available for plant growth.\nAnnual precipitation ranges from 25 cm to 75 cm (9.8\u201329.5 in). Because of relatively lower annual precipitation in temperate\ngrasslands, there are few trees except for those found growing along rivers or streams. The dominant vegetation tends to consist\nof grasses dense enough to sustain populations of grazing animals Figure 44.17. The vegetation is very dense and the soils are\nfertile because the subsurface of the soil is packed with the roots and rhizomes (underground stems) of these grasses. The roots\nand rhizomes act to anchor plants into the ground and replenish the organic material (humus) in the soil when they die and\ndecay.\nFigure 44.17 The American bison (Bison bison), more commonly called the buffalo, is a grazing mammal that once populated American\nprairies in huge numbers. (credit: Jack Dykinga, USDA Agricultural Research Service)\nFires, mainly caused by lightning, are a natural disturbance in temperate grasslands. When fire is suppressed in temperate\ngrasslands, the vegetation eventually converts to scrub and sometimes dense forests with drought-tolerant tree species. Often,\nthe restoration or management of temperate grasslands requires the use of controlled burns to suppress the growth of trees and\nmaintain the grasses.\nTemperate Forests\nTemperate forests are the most common biome in eastern North America, Western Europe, Eastern Asia, Chile, and New\nZealand (Figure 44.12). This biome is found throughout mid-latitude regions. Temperatures range between -30 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C (-22\n\u00b0F to 86 \u00b0F) and drop to below freezing periodically during cold winters. These temperatures mean that temperate forests have\ndefined growing seasons during the spring, summer, and early fall. Precipitation is relatively constant throughout the year and\nranges between 75 cm and 150 cm (29.5\u201359 in).\nBecause of the moderate annual rainfall and temperatures, deciduous trees are the dominant plant in this biome (Figure 44.18).\nDeciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and remain leafless in the winter. Thus, no photosynthesis occurs in the deciduous\ntrees during the dormant winter period. Each spring, new leaves appear as the temperature increases. Because of the dormant\nperiod, the net primary productivity of temperate forests is less than that of tropical wet forests. In addition, temperate forests\nshow less diversity of tree species than tropical wet forest biomes.\n1276\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 44.18 Deciduous trees are the dominant plant in the temperate forest. (credit: Oliver Herold)\nThe trees of the temperate forests leaf out and shade much of the ground; however, this biome is more open than tropical wet\nforests because most trees in the temperate forests do not grow as tall as the trees in tropical wet forests. The soils of the\ntemperate forests are rich in inorganic and organic nutrients. This is due to the thick layer of leaf litter on forest floors, which\ndoes not develop in tropical rainforests. As this leaf litter decays, nutrients are returned to the soil. The leaf litter also protects\nsoil from erosion, insulates the ground, and provides habitats for invertebrates (such as the pill bug or roly-poly, Armadillidium\nvulgare) and their predators, such as the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus).\nBoreal Forests\nThe boreal forest, also known as taiga or coniferous forest, is found south of the Arctic Circle and across most of Canada,\nAlaska, Russia, and northern Europe (Figure 44.12). This biome has cold, dry winters and short, cool, wet summers. The annual\nprecipitation is from 40 cm to 100 cm (15.7\u201339 in) and usually takes the form of snow. Little evaporation occurs because of the\ncold temperatures.\nThe long and cold winters in the boreal forest have led to the predominance of cold-tolerant cone-bearing (coniferous) plants.\nThese are evergreen coniferous trees like pines, spruce, and fir, which retain their needle-shaped leaves year-round. Evergreen\ntrees can photosynthesize earlier in the spring than deciduous trees because less energy from the sun is required to warm a\nneedle-like leaf than a broad leaf. This benefits evergreen trees, which grow faster than deciduous trees in the boreal forest. In\naddition, soils in boreal forest regions tend to be acidic with little available nitrogen. Leaves are a nitrogen-rich structure and\ndeciduous trees must produce a new set of these nitrogen-rich structures each year. Therefore, coniferous trees that retain\nnitrogen-rich needles may have a competitive advantage over the broad-leafed deciduous trees.\nThe net primary productivity of boreal forests is lower than that of temperate forests and tropical wet forests. The above-ground\nbiomass of boreal forests is high because these slow-growing tree species are long-lived and accumulate a large standing\nbiomass over time. Plant species diversity is less than that seen in temperate forests and tropical wet forests. Boreal forests lack\nthe pronounced elements of the layered forest structure seen in tropical wet forests. The structure of a boreal forest is often only\na tree layer and a ground layer (Figure 44.19). When conifer needles are dropped, they decompose more slowly than broad leaves;\ntherefore, fewer nutrients are returned to the soil to fuel plant growth.\n44.3 \u2022 Terrestrial Biomes\n1277\nFigure 44.19 The boreal forest (taiga) has low lying plants and conifer trees. (credit: L.B. Brubaker)\nArctic Tundra\nThe Arctic tundra lies north of the subarctic boreal forest and is located throughout the Arctic regions of the northern\nhemisphere (Figure 44.12). The average winter temperature is \u201334 \u00b0C (\u201329.2 \u00b0F) and the average summer temperature is from 3\n\u00b0C to 12 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F\u201352 \u00b0F). Plants in the arctic tundra have a very short growing season of approximately 10\u201312 weeks.\nHowever, during this time, there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid. The annual precipitation of the Arctic\ntundra is very low with little annual variation in precipitation. And, as in the boreal forests, there is little evaporation due to the\ncold temperatures.\nPlants in the Arctic tundra are generally low to the ground (Figure 44.20). There is little species diversity, low net primary\nproductivity, and low above-ground biomass. The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to\nas permafrost. The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic\nmatter, which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter. During the growing season, the ground of the Arctic tundra\ncan be completely covered with plants or lichens.\nFigure 44.20 Low-growing plants such as shrub willow dominate the tundra landscape, shown here in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n(credit: USFWS Arctic National Wildlife Refuge)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this Assignment Discovery: Biomes video (http://openstax.org/l/biomes) for an overview of biomes.

The aquatic medium\u2014water\u2014 has different\nphysical and chemical properties than air, however. Even if the water in a pond or other body of water is perfectly clear (there are\nno suspended particles), water, on its own, absorbs light. As one descends into a deep body of water, there will eventually be a\ndepth which the sunlight cannot reach. While there are some abiotic and biotic factors in a terrestrial ecosystem that might\nobscure light (like fog, dust, or insect swarms), usually these are not permanent features of the environment. The importance of\nlight in aquatic biomes is central to the communities of organisms found in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. In\nfreshwater systems, stratification due to differences in density is perhaps the most critical abiotic factor and is related to the\nenergy aspects of light. The thermal properties of water (rates of heating and cooling and the ability to store much larger\namounts of energy than the air) are significant to the function of marine systems and have major impacts on global climate and\nweather patterns. Marine systems are also influenced by large-scale physical water movements, such as currents; these are less\nimportant in most freshwater lakes.\nThe ocean is categorized by several areas or zones (Figure 44.21). All of the ocean\u2019s open water is referred to as the pelagic realm\n(or zone). The benthic realm (or zone) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor.\nWithin the pelagic realm is the photic zone, which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate (approximately 200 m or\n650 ft). At depths greater than 200 m, light cannot penetrate; thus, this is referred to as the aphotic zone. The majority of the\nocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient light for photosynthesis. The deepest part of the ocean, the Challenger Deep (in the Mariana\nTrench, located in the western Pacific Ocean), is about 11,000 m (about 6.8 mi) deep. To give some perspective on the depth of\nthis trench, the ocean is, on average, 4267 m or 14,000 ft deep. These realms and zones are relevant to freshwater lakes as well.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 44.21 The ocean is divided into different zones based on water depth and distance from the shoreline.\nIn which of the following regions would you expect to find photosynthetic organisms?\na.\nthe aphotic zone, the neritic zone, the oceanic zone, and the benthic realm\nb.\nthe photic zone, the intertidal zone, the neritic zone, and the oceanic zone\nc.\nthe photic zone, the abyssal zone, the neritic zone, and the oceanic zone\nd.\nthe pelagic realm, the aphotic zone, the neritic zone, and the oceanic zone\n44.4 \u2022 Aquatic Biomes\n1279\nMarine Biomes\nThe ocean is the largest marine biome. It is a continuous body of salt water that is relatively uniform in chemical composition; in\nfact, it is a weak solution of mineral salts and decayed biological matter. Within the ocean, coral reefs are a second kind of\nmarine biome. Estuaries, coastal areas where salt water and fresh water mix, form a third unique marine biome.\nOcean\nThe physical diversity of the ocean is a significant influence on plants, animals, and other organisms. The ocean is categorized\ninto different zones based on how far light reaches into the water. Each zone has a distinct group of species adapted to the biotic\nand abiotic conditions particular to that zone.\nThe intertidal zone, which is the zone between high and low tide, is the oceanic region that is closest to land (Figure 44.21).\nGenerally, most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach. In some cases, the intertidal zone is indeed a sandy\nbeach, but it can also be rocky or muddy. The intertidal zone is an extremely variable environment because of action of tidal ebb\nand flow. Organisms are exposed to air and sunlight at low tide and are underwater most of the time, especially during high\ntide. Therefore, living things that thrive in the intertidal zone are adapted to being dry for long periods of time. The shore of the\nintertidal zone may also be repeatedly struck by waves, and the organisms found there are adapted to withstand damage from\ntheir pounding action (Figure 44.22). The exoskeletons of shoreline crustaceans (such as the shore crab, Carcinus maenas) are\ntough and protect them from desiccation (drying out) and wave damage. Another consequence of the pounding waves is that\nfew algae and plants establish themselves in the constantly moving rocks, sand, or mud.\nFigure 44.22 Sea urchins, mussel shells, and starfish are often found in the intertidal zone, shown here in Kachemak Bay, Alaska. (credit:\nNOAA)\nThe neritic zone (Figure 44.21) extends from the intertidal zone to depths of about 200 m (or 650 ft) at the edge of the continental\nshelf (the underwater landmass that extends from a continent). Since light can penetrate this depth, photosynthesis can still\noccur in the neritic zone. The water here contains silt and is well-oxygenated, low in pressure, and stable in temperature.\nPhytoplankton and floating Sargassum (a type of free-floating marine seaweed) provide a habitat for some sea life found in the\nneritic zone. Zooplankton, protists, small fishes, and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for\nmost of the world\u2019s fisheries.\nBeyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the pelagic or open oceanic zone (Figure 44.21). Within the oceanic\nzone there is thermal stratification where warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents. Abundant plankton serve as the\nbase of the food chain for larger animals such as whales and dolphins. Nutrients are scarce and this is a relatively less productive\npart of the marine biome. When photosynthetic organisms and the protists and animals that feed on them die, their bodies fall\nto the bottom of the ocean, where they remain. Unlike freshwater lakes, most of the open ocean lacks a process for bringing the\norganic nutrients back up to the surface. (Exceptions include major oceanic upwellings within the Humboldt Current along the\nwestern coast of South America.) The majority of organisms in the aphotic zone include sea cucumbers (phylum Echinodermata)\nand other organisms that survive on the nutrients contained in the dead bodies of organisms in the photic zone.\nBeneath the pelagic zone is the benthic realm, the deep-water region beyond the continental shelf (Figure 44.21). The bottom of\nthe benthic realm is composed of sand, silt, and dead organisms. Temperature decreases, remaining above freezing, as water\ndepth increases. This is a nutrient-rich portion of the ocean because of the dead organisms that fall from the upper layers of the\nocean. Because of this high level of nutrients, a diversity of fungi, sponges, sea anemones, marine worms, sea stars, fishes, and\n1280\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nbacteria exist.\nThe deepest part of the ocean is the abyssal zone, which is at depths of 4000 m or greater. The abyssal zone (Figure 44.21) is very\ncold and has very high pressure, high oxygen content, and low nutrient content. There are a variety of invertebrates and fishes\nfound in this zone, but the abyssal zone does not have plants because of the lack of light. Hydrothermal vents are found\nprimarily in the abyssal zone; chemosynthetic bacteria utilize the hydrogen sulfide and other minerals emitted from the vents.\nThese chemosynthetic bacteria use the hydrogen sulfide as an energy source and serve as the base of the food chain found in the\nabyssal zone.\nCoral Reefs\nCoral reefs are ocean ridges formed by marine invertebrates, comprising mostly cnidarians and molluscs, living in warm\nshallow waters within the photic zone of the ocean. They are found within 30\u02da north and south of the equator. The Great Barrier\nReef is perhaps the best-known and largest reef system in the world\u2014visible from the International Space Station! This massive\nand ancient reef is located several miles off the northeastern coast of Australia. Other coral reef systems are fringing islands,\nwhich are directly adjacent to land, or atolls, which are circular reef systems surrounding a former landmass that is now\nunderwater. The coral organisms (members of phylum Cnidaria) are colonies of saltwater polyps that secrete a calcium\ncarbonate skeleton. These calcium-rich skeletons slowly accumulate, forming the underwater reef (Figure 44.23). Corals found\nin shallower waters (at a depth of approximately 60 m or about 200 ft) have a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic\nunicellular algae. The relationship provides corals with the majority of the nutrition and the energy they require. The waters in\nwhich these corals live are nutritionally poor and, without this mutualism, it would not be possible for large corals to grow.\nSome corals living in deeper and colder water do not have a mutualistic relationship with algae; these corals attain energy and\nnutrients using stinging cells called cnidocytes on their tentacles to capture prey.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) video (http://openstax.org/l/marine_biology) to see\nmarine ecologist Dr. Peter Etnoyer discuss his research on coral organisms.\nIt is estimated that more than 4,000 fish species inhabit coral reefs. These fishes can feed on coral, the cryptofauna\n(invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs), or the seaweed and algae that are associated with\nthe coral. In addition, some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef; these species include predators, herbivores, and\nplanktivores, which consume planktonic organisms such as bacteria, archaea, algae, and protists floating in the pelagic zone.\nFigure 44.23 Coral reefs are formed by the calcium carbonate skeletons of coral organisms, which are marine invertebrates in the phylum\n44.4 \u2022 Aquatic Biomes\n1281\nCnidaria. (credit: Terry Hughes)\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nGlobal Decline of Coral Reefs\nIt takes many thousands of years to build a coral reef. The animals that create coral reefs have evolved over millions of years,\ncontinuing to slowly deposit the calcium carbonate that forms their characteristic ocean homes. Bathed in warm tropical\nwaters, the coral animals and their symbiotic algal partners evolved to survive at the upper limit of ocean water temperature.\nTogether, climate change and human activity pose dual threats to the long-term survival of the world\u2019s coral reefs. As global\nwarming due to fossil fuel emissions raises ocean temperatures, coral reefs are suffering. The excessive warmth causes the reefs\nto lose their symbiotic, food-producing algae, resulting in a phenomenon known as bleaching. When bleaching occurs, the reefs\nlose much of their characteristic color as the algae and the coral animals die if loss of the symbiotic zooxanthellae is prolonged.\nRising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide further threaten the corals in other ways; as CO2 dissolves in ocean waters, it lowers\nthe pH and increases ocean acidity. As acidity increases, it interferes with the calcification that normally occurs when coral\nanimals build their calcium carbonate shelters.\nWhen a coral reef begins to die, species diversity plummets as animals lose food and shelter. Coral reefs are also economically\nimportant tourist destinations, so the decline of coral reefs poses a serious threat to coastal economies.\nHuman population growth has damaged corals in other ways, too. As human coastal populations increase, the runoff of\nsediment and agricultural chemicals has increased, as well, causing some of the once-clear tropical waters to become cloudy. At\nthe same time, overfishing of popular fish species has allowed the predator species that eat corals to go unchecked.\nAlthough a rise in global temperatures of 1\u20132 \u02daC (a conservative scientific projection) in the coming decades may not seem large,\nit is very significant to this biome. When change occurs rapidly, species can become extinct before evolution can offer new\nadaptations. Many scientists believe that global warming, with its rapid (in terms of evolutionary time) and inexorable increases\nin temperature, is tipping the balance beyond the point at which many of the world\u2019s coral reefs can recover.\nEstuaries: Where the Ocean Meets Fresh Water\nEstuaries are biomes that occur where a source of fresh water, such as a river, meets the ocean. Therefore, both fresh water and\nsalt water are found in the same vicinity; mixing results in a diluted (brackish) saltwater. Estuaries form protected areas where\nmany of the young offspring of crustaceans, molluscs, and fish begin their lives, which also creates important breeding grounds\nfor other animals. Salinity is a very important factor that influences the organisms and the adaptations of the organisms found\nin estuaries. The salinity of estuaries varies considerably and is based on the rate of flow of its freshwater sources, which may\ndepend on the seasonal rainfall. Once or twice a day, high tides bring salt water into the estuary. Low tides occurring at the same\nfrequency reverse the current of salt water.\nThe short-term and rapid variation in salinity due to the mixing of fresh water and salt water is a difficult physiological\nchallenge for the plants and animals that inhabit estuaries. Many estuarine plant species are halophytes: plants that can tolerate\nsalty conditions. Halophytic plants are adapted to deal with the salinity resulting from saltwater on their roots or from sea spray.\nIn some halophytes, filters in the roots remove the salt from the water that the plant absorbs. Other plants are able to pump\noxygen into their roots. Animals, such as mussels and clams (phylum Mollusca), have developed behavioral adaptations that\nexpend a lot of energy to function in this rapidly changing environment. When these animals are exposed to low salinity, they\nstop feeding, close their shells, and switch from aerobic respiration (in which they use gills to remove oxygen from the water) to\nanaerobic respiration (a process that does not require oxygen and takes place in the cytoplasm of the animal\u2019s cells). When high\ntide returns to the estuary, the salinity and oxygen content of the water increases, and these animals open their shells, begin\nfeeding, and return to aerobic respiration.\nFreshwater Biomes\nFreshwater biomes include lakes and ponds (standing water) as well as rivers and streams (flowing water). They also include\nwetlands, which will be discussed later. Humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide ecosystem benefits, which are aquatic\nresources for drinking water, crop irrigation, sanitation, and industry. Lakes and ponds are connected with abiotic and biotic\nfactors influencing their terrestrial biomes.\n1282\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nLakes and Ponds\nLakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. Temperature is an important\nabiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. In the summer, as we have seen, thermal stratification of lakes\nand ponds occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. Light can\npenetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond. Phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria) are found here and carry out\nphotosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and ponds. Zooplankton, such as rotifers and larvae and adult\ncrustaceans, consume these phytoplankton. At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead\norganisms that sink to the bottom.\nNitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. Because of this, they are the determining factors\nin the amount of phytoplankton growth that takes place in lakes and ponds. When there is a large input of nitrogen and\nphosphorus (from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms, for example), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in\na large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom. Algal blooms (Figure 44.24) can become so extensive that they reduce light\npenetration in water. They may also release toxic byproducts into the water, contaminating any drinking water taken from that\nsource. In addition, the lake or pond becomes aphotic, and photosynthetic plants cannot survive. When the algae die and\ndecompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs. Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are then more likely to\ndie, resulting in a dead zone. Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent freshwater and marine habitats where phosphorus\ncontrol and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges.\nFigure 44.24 The uncontrolled growth of algae in this lake has resulted in an algal bloom. (credit: Jeremy Nettleton)\nRivers and Streams\nRivers and streams are continuously moving bodies of water that carry large amounts of water from the source, or headwater, to\na lake or ocean. The largest rivers include the Nile River in Africa, the Amazon River in South America, and the Mississippi River\nin North America.\nAbiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream. Streams begin at a point of origin referred to\nas source water. The source water is usually cold, low in nutrients, and clear. The channel (the width of the river or stream) is\nnarrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream. Because of this, the current is often faster here than at\nany other point of the river or stream.\nThe fast-moving water results in minimal silt accumulation at the bottom of the river or stream; therefore, the water is usually\nclear and free of debris. Photosynthesis here is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on rocks; the swift current inhibits\nthe growth of phytoplankton. An additional input of energy can come from leaves and other organic material that fall\ndownstream into the river or stream, as well as from trees and other plants that border the water. When the leaves decompose,\nthe organic material and nutrients in the leaves are returned to the water. Plants and animals have adapted to this fast-moving\nwater. For instance, leeches (phylum Annelida) have elongated bodies and suckers on the anterior and ventral areas of the body.\nThese suckers attach to the substrate, keeping the leech anchored in place, and are also used to attach to their prey. Freshwater\ntrout species (phylum Chordata) are an important predator in these fast-moving rivers and streams.\nAs the river or stream flows away from the source, the width of the channel gradually widens and the current slows. This slow-\nmoving water, caused by the gradient decrease and the volume increase as tributaries unite, has more sedimentation.\n44.4 \u2022 Aquatic Biomes\n1283\nPhytoplankton can also be suspended in slow-moving water. Therefore, the water will not be as clear as it is near the source. The\nwater is also warmer. Worms (phylum Annelida) and insects (phylum Arthropoda) can be found burrowing into the mud. The\nhigher order predator vertebrates (phylum Chordata) include waterfowl, frogs, and fishes. These predators must find food in\nthese slow moving, sometimes murky, waters and, unlike the trout in the waters at the source, these vertebrates may not be able\nto use vision as their primary sense to find food. Instead, they are more likely to use taste or chemical cues to find prey.\nWetlands\nWetlands are environments in which the soil is either permanently or periodically saturated with water. Wetlands are different\nfrom lakes because wetlands are shallow bodies of water whereas lakes vary in depth. Emergent vegetation consists of wetland\nplants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves, stems, and flowers extending above the water\u2019s surface. There are\nseveral types of wetlands including marshes, swamps, bogs, mudflats, and salt marshes (Figure 44.25). The three shared\ncharacteristics among these types\u2014what makes them wetlands\u2014are their hydrology, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydric soils.\nFigure 44.25 Located in southern Florida, Everglades National Park is vast array of wetland environments, including sawgrass marshes,\ncypress swamps, and estuarine mangrove forests. Here, a great egret walks among cypress trees. (credit: NPS)\nFreshwater marshes and swamps are characterized by slow and steady water flow. Bogs, however, develop in depressions where\nwater flow is low or nonexistent. Bogs usually occur in areas where there is a clay bottom with poor percolation of water.\n(Percolation is the movement of water through the pores in the soil or rocks.) The water found in a bog is stagnant and oxygen-\ndepleted because the oxygen used during the decomposition of organic matter is not readily replaced. As the oxygen in the water\nis depleted, decomposition slows. This leads to a buildup of acids and a lower water pH. The lower pH creates challenges for\nplants because it limits the available nitrogen. As a result, some bog plants (such as sundews, pitcher plants, and Venus flytraps)\ncapture insects in order to extract the nitrogen from their bodies. Bogs have low net primary productivity because the water\nfound in bogs has low levels of nitrogen and oxygen.\n44.5 Climate and the Effects of Global Climate Change\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDefine global climate change\n\u2022\nSummarize the effects of the Industrial Revolution on global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration\n\u2022\nDescribe three natural factors affecting long-term global climate\n\u2022\nList two or more greenhouse gases and describe their role in the greenhouse effect\nAll biomes are universally affected by global conditions, such as climate, that ultimately shape each biome\u2019s environment.\nScientists who study climate have noted a series of marked changes that have gradually become increasingly evident during the\nlast sixty years. Global climate change is the term used to describe altered global weather patterns, especially a worldwide\nincrease in temperature and resulting changes in the climate, due largely to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nClimate and Weather\nA common misconception about global climate change is that a specific weather event occurring in a particular region (for\nexample, a very cool week in June in central Indiana) provides evidence of global climate change. However, a cold week in June is\na weather-related event and not a climate-related one. These misconceptions often arise because of confusion over the terms\nclimate and weather.\n1284\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nClimate refers to the long-term, predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area. The climate of a biome is characterized\nby having consistent seasonal temperature and rainfall ranges. Climate does not address the amount of rain that fell on one\nparticular day in a biome or the colder-than-average temperatures that occurred on one day. In contrast, weather refers to the\nconditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time. Weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour cycles. Long-range\nweather forecasts are available but can be unreliable.\nTo better understand the difference between climate and weather, imagine that you are planning an outdoor event in northern\nWisconsin. You would be thinking about climate when you plan the event in the summer rather than the winter because you\nhave long-term knowledge that any given Saturday in the months of May to August would be a better choice for an outdoor event\nin Wisconsin than any given Saturday in January. However, you cannot determine the specific day that the event should be held\non because it is difficult to accurately predict the weather on a specific day. Climate can be considered \u201caverage\u201d weather that\ntakes place over many years.\nGlobal Climate Change\nClimate change can be understood by approaching three areas of study:\n\u2022\nevidence of current and past global climate change\n\u2022\ndrivers of global climate change\n\u2022\ndocumented results of climate change\nIt is helpful to keep these three different aspects of climate change clearly separated when consuming media reports about\nglobal climate change. We should note that it is common for reports and discussions about global climate change to confuse the\ndata showing that Earth\u2019s climate is changing with the factors that drive this climate change.\nEvidence for Global Climate Change\nSince scientists cannot go back in time to directly measure climatic variables, such as average temperature and precipitation,\nthey must instead indirectly measure temperature. To do this, scientists rely on historical evidence of Earth\u2019s past climate.\nAntarctic ice cores are a key example of such evidence for climate change. These ice cores are samples of polar ice obtained by\nmeans of drills that reach thousands of meters into ice sheets or high mountain glaciers. Viewing the ice cores is like traveling\nbackwards through time; the deeper the sample, the earlier the time period. Trapped within the ice are air bubbles and other\nbiological evidence that can reveal temperature and carbon dioxide data. Antarctic ice cores have been collected and analyzed to\nindirectly estimate the temperature of the Earth over the past 400,000 years (Figure 44.26a). The 0 \u00b0C on this graph refers to the\nlong-term average. Temperatures that are greater than 0 \u00b0C exceed Earth\u2019s long-term average temperature. Conversely,\ntemperatures that are less than 0 \u00b0C are less than Earth\u2019s average temperature. This figure shows that there have been periodic\ncycles of increasing and decreasing temperature.\n44.5 \u2022 Climate and the Effects of Global Climate Change\n1285\nFigure 44.26 Scientists drill for ice cores in polar regions. The ice contains air bubbles and biological substances that provide important\ninformation for researchers. (credit: a: Helle Astrid Kj\u00e6r; b: National Ice Core Laboratory, USGS)\nBefore the late 1800s, the Earth has been as much as 9 \u00b0C cooler and about 3 \u00b0C warmer. Note that the graph in Figure 44.27b\nshows that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has also risen and fallen in periodic cycles. Also note the\nrelationship between carbon dioxide concentration and temperature. Figure 44.27b shows that carbon dioxide levels in the\natmosphere have historically cycled between 180 and 300 parts per million (ppm) by volume.\n1286\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 44.27 Ice at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica was laid down over the course of 420,000 years and reached a depth of\nover 3,000 m. By measuring the amount of CO2 trapped in the ice, scientists have determined past atmospheric CO2 concentrations.\nTemperatures relative to modern day were determined from the amount of deuterium (a nonradioactive isotope of hydrogen) present.\nFigure 44.27a does not show the last 2,000 years with enough detail to compare the changes of Earth\u2019s temperature during the\nlast 400,000 years with the temperature change that has occurred in the more recent past. Two significant temperature\nanomalies, or irregularities, have occurred in the last 2,000 years. These are the Medieval Climate Anomaly (or the Medieval\nWarm Period) and the Little Ice Age. A third temperature anomaly aligns with the Industrial Era. The Medieval Climate Anomaly\noccurred between 900 and 1300 AD. During this time period, many climate scientists think that slightly warmer weather\nconditions prevailed in many parts of the world; the higher-than-average temperature changes varied between 0.10 \u00b0C and 0.20\n\u00b0C above the norm. Although 0.10 \u00b0C does not seem large enough to produce any noticeable change, it did free seas of ice.\nBecause of this warming, the Vikings were able to colonize Greenland.\nThe Little Ice Age was a cold period that occurred between 1550 AD and 1850 AD. During this time, a slight cooling of a little less\nthan 1 \u00b0C was observed in North America, Europe, and possibly other areas of the Earth. This 1 \u00b0C change in global temperature\nis a seemingly small deviation in temperature (as was observed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly); however, it also resulted\nin noticeable climatic changes. Historical accounts reveal a time of exceptionally harsh winters with much snow and frost.\nThe Industrial Revolution, which began around 1750, was characterized by changes in much of human society. Advances in\nagriculture increased the food supply, which improved the standard of living for people in Europe and the United States. New\ntechnologies were invented that provided jobs and cheaper goods. These new technologies were powered using fossil fuels,\nespecially coal. The Industrial Revolution starting in the early nineteenth century ushered in the beginning of the Industrial Era.\nWhen a fossil fuel is burned, carbon dioxide is released. With the beginning of the Industrial Era, atmospheric carbon dioxide\nbegan to rise (Figure 44.28).\n44.5 \u2022 Climate and the Effects of Global Climate Change\n1287\nFigure 44.28 The atmospheric concentration of CO2 has risen steadily since the beginning of industrialization.\nCurrent and Past Drivers of Global Climate Change\nBecause it is not possible to go back in time to directly observe and measure climate, scientists must use indirect evidence to\ndetermine the drivers, or factors, that may be responsible for climate change. The indirect evidence includes data collected\nusing ice cores, boreholes (a narrow shaft bored into the ground), tree rings, glacier lengths, pollen remains, and ocean\nsediments. The data shows a correlation between the timing of temperature changes and drivers of climate change. Before the\nIndustrial Era (pre-1780), there were three drivers of climate change that were not related to human activity or atmospheric\ngases. The first of these is the Milankovitch cycles. The Milankovitch cycles describe the effects of slight changes in the Earth\u2019s\norbit on Earth\u2019s climate. The length of the Milankovitch cycles ranges between 19,000 and 100,000 years. In other words, one\ncould expect to see some predictable changes in the Earth\u2019s climate associated with changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit at a minimum of\nevery 19,000 years.\nThe variation in the sun\u2019s intensity is the second natural factor responsible for climate change. Solar intensity is the amount of\nsolar power or energy the sun emits in a given amount of time. There is a direct relationship between solar intensity and\ntemperature. As solar intensity increases (or decreases), the Earth\u2019s temperature correspondingly increases (or decreases).\nChanges in solar intensity have been proposed as one of several possible explanations for the Little Ice Age.\nFinally, volcanic eruptions are a third natural driver of climate change. Volcanic eruptions can last a few days, but the solids and\ngases released during an eruption can influence the climate over a period of a few years, causing short-term climate changes.\nThe gases and solids released by volcanic eruptions can include carbon dioxide, water vapor, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide,\nhydrogen, and carbon monoxide. Generally, volcanic eruptions cool the climate. This occurred in 1783 when volcanos in Iceland\nerupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide. This led to haze-effect cooling, a global phenomenon that\noccurs when dust, ash, or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global temperatures as a result; haze-\neffect cooling usually extends for one or more years before dissipating in intensity. In Europe and North America, haze-effect\ncooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in 1783 and 1784.\nGreenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate. When heat energy from the sun strikes the Earth,\ngases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere, in a similar manner as do the glass panes of a greenhouse\nkeep heat from escaping. The greenhouse gases that affect Earth include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, nitrous oxide,\nand ozone. Approximately half of the radiation from the sun passes through these gases in the atmosphere and strikes the\nEarth. This radiation is converted into thermal (infrared) radiation on the Earth\u2019s surface, and then a portion of that energy is re-\nradiated back into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, however, reflect much of the thermal energy back to the Earth\u2019s surface.\nThe more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more thermal energy is reflected back to the Earth\u2019s surface,\nheating it up and the atmosphere immediately above it. Greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important\nfactor in the greenhouse effect: the warming of Earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nDirect evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature: as carbon\ndioxide rises, global temperature rises. Since 1950, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from about\n280 ppm to 382 ppm in 2006. In 2011, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was 392 ppm. However, the planet would\n1288\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nnot be inhabitable by current life forms if water vapor did not produce its drastic greenhouse warming effect.\nScientists look at patterns in data and try to explain differences or deviations from these patterns. The atmospheric carbon\ndioxide data reveal a historical pattern of carbon dioxide increasing and decreasing, cycling between a low of 180 ppm and a\nhigh of 300 ppm. Scientists have concluded that it took around 50,000 years for the atmospheric carbon dioxide level to increase\nfrom its low minimum concentration to its higher maximum concentration. However, beginning only a few centuries ago,\natmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased beyond the historical maximum of 300 ppm. The current increases\nin atmospheric carbon dioxide have happened very quickly\u2014in a matter of hundreds of years rather than thousands of years.\nWhat is the reason for this difference in the rate of change and the amount of increase in carbon dioxide? A key factor that must\nbe recognized when comparing the historical data and the current data is the presence and industrial activities of modern\nhuman society; no other driver of climate change has yielded changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at this rate or to this\nmagnitude.\nHuman activity releases carbon dioxide and methane, two of the most important greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere in\nseveral ways. The primary mechanism that releases carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels, such as gasoline, coal, and\nnatural gas (Figure 44.29). Deforestation, cement manufacture, animal agriculture, the clearing of land, and the burning of\nforests are other human activities that release carbon dioxide. Methane (CH4) is produced when bacteria break down organic\nmatter under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic conditions can happen when organic matter is trapped underwater (such as in\nrice paddies) or in the intestines of herbivores. Methane can also be released from natural gas fields and the decomposition of\nanimal and plant material that occurs in landfills. Another source of methane is the melting of clathrates. Clathrates are frozen\nchunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean. When water warms, these chunks of ice melt and methane is\nreleased. As the ocean\u2019s water temperature increases, the rate at which clathrates melt is increasing, releasing even more\nmethane. This leads to increased levels of methane in the atmosphere, which further accelerates the rate of global warming. This\nis an example of the positive feedback loop that is leading to the rapid rate of increase of global temperatures.\nFigure 44.29 The burning of fossil fuels in industry and by vehicles releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the\natmosphere.

Modern-day phenomena such as retreating\nglaciers and melting polar ice cause a continual rise in sea level. Meanwhile, changes in climate can negatively affect organisms.\nGeological Climate Change\nGlobal warming has been associated with at least one planet-wide extinction event during the geological past. The Permian\nextinction event occurred about 251 million years ago toward the end of the roughly 50-million-year-long geological time span\n44.5 \u2022 Climate and the Effects of Global Climate Change\n1289\nknown as the Permian period. This geologic time period was one of the three warmest periods in Earth\u2019s geologic history.\nScientists estimate that approximately 70 percent of the terrestrial plant and animal species and 84 percent of marine species\nbecame extinct, vanishing forever near the end of the Permian period.\nOrganisms that had adapted to wet and warm climatic conditions, such as annual rainfall of 300\u2013400 cm (118\u2013157 in) and 20\n\u00b0C\u201330 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F\u201386 \u00b0F) in the tropical wet forest, may not have been able to survive the Permian climate change.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this NASA video (http://openstax.org/l/climate_plants) to discover the mixed effects of global warming on plant growth.\nWhile scientists found that warmer temperatures in the 1980s and 1990s caused an increase in plant productivity, this advantage\nhas since been counteracted by more frequent droughts.\nPresent Climate Change\nA number of global events have occurred that may be attributed to climate change during our lifetimes. Glacier National Park in\nMontana is undergoing the retreat of many of its glaciers, a phenomenon known as glacier recession. In 1850, the area\ncontained approximately 150 glaciers. By 2010, however, the park contained only about 24 glaciers greater than 25 acres in size.\nOne of these glaciers is the Grinnell Glacier (Figure 44.30) at Mount Gould. Between 1966 and 2005, the size of Grinnell Glacier\nshrank by 40 percent. Similarly, the mass of the ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic is decreasing: Greenland lost 150\u2013250\nkm3 of ice per year between 2002 and 2006. In addition, the size and thickness of the Arctic sea ice is decreasing.\nFigure 44.30 The effect of global warming can be seen in the continuing retreat of Grinnel Glacier. The mean annual temperature in the\npark has increased 1.33 \u00b0C since 1900. The loss of a glacier results in the loss of summer meltwaters, sharply reducing seasonal water\nsupplies and severely affecting local ecosystems. (credit: modification of work by USGS)\nThis loss of ice is leading to increases in the global sea level. On average, the sea is rising at a rate of 1.8 mm per year. However,\nbetween 1993 and 2010 the rate of sea level increase ranged between 2.9 and 3.4 mm per year. A variety of factors affect the\nvolume of water in the ocean, especially the temperature of the water (the density of water is related to its temperature: water\nvolume expands as it warms, thus raising sea levels), as well as the amount of water found in rivers, lakes, glaciers, polar ice\ncaps, and sea ice. As glaciers and polar ice caps melt, there is a significant contribution of liquid water that was previously\nfrozen.\nIn addition to some abiotic conditions changing in response to climate change, many organisms are also being affected by the\nchanges in temperature. Temperature and precipitation play key roles in determining the geographic distribution and\nphenology of plants and animals. (Phenology is the study of the effects of climatic conditions on the timing of periodic life cycle\nevents, such as flowering in plants or migration in birds.) Researchers have shown that 385 plant species in Great Britain are\nflowering 4.5 days sooner than was recorded earlier during the previous 40 years. In addition, insect-pollinated species were\nmore likely to flower earlier than wind-pollinated species. The impact of changes in flowering date would be mitigated if the\ninsect pollinators emerged earlier. This mismatched timing of plants and pollinators could result in injurious ecosystem effects\nbecause, for continued survival, insect-pollinated plants must flower when their pollinators are present.\n1290\nChapter 44 \u2022 Ecology and the Biosphere\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n", "key_terms": "\nabiotic\nnonliving components of the environment\nabove-ground biomass\ntotal mass of aboveground living\nplants per area\nabyssal zone\ndeepest part of the ocean at depths of 4000 m\nor greater\nalgal bloom\nrapid increase of algae in an aquatic system\naphotic zone\npart of the ocean where no light penetrates\nbenthic realm\n(also, benthic zone) part of the ocean that\nextends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the\ndeepest parts of the ocean floor\nbiogeography\nstudy of the geographic distribution of living\nthings and the abiotic factors that affect their\ndistribution\nbiome\necological community of plants, animals, and other\norganisms that is adapted to a characteristic set of\nenvironmental conditions\nbiotic\nliving components of the environment\ncanopy\nbranches and foliage of trees that form a layer of\noverhead coverage in a forest\nchannel\nwidth of a river or stream from one bank to the\nother bank\nclathrates\nfrozen chunks of ice and methane found at the\nbottom of the ocean\nclimate\nlong-term, predictable atmospheric conditions\npresent in a specific area\nconspecifics\nindividuals that are members of the same\nspecies\ncoral reef\nocean ridges formed by marine invertebrates\nliving in warm, shallow waters within the photic zone\ncryptofauna\ninvertebrates found within the calcium\ncarbonate substrate of coral reefs\necology\nstudy of interaction between living things and\ntheir environment\necosystem services\nhuman benefits and services provided\nby natural ecosystems\nemergent vegetation\nwetland plants that are rooted in the\nsoil but have portions of leaves, stems, and flowers\nextending above the water\u2019s surface\nendemic\nspecies found only in a specific geographic area\nthat is usually restricted in size\nestuary\nbiomes where a source of fresh water, such as a\nriver, meets the ocean\nfall and spring turnover\nseasonal process that recycles\nnutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater\necosystem to the top\nglobal climate change\naltered global weather patterns,\nincluding a worldwide increase in temperature, due\nlargely to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide\ngreenhouse effect\nwarming of Earth due to carbon dioxide\nand other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\ngreenhouse gases\natmospheric gases such as carbon\ndioxide and methane that absorb and emit radiation,\nthus trapping heat in Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nhaze-effect cooling\neffect of the gases and solids from a\nvolcanic eruption on global climate\nheterospecifics\nindividuals that are members of different\nspecies\nintertidal zone\npart of the ocean that is closest to land;\nparts extend above the water at low tide\nMilankovitch cycles\ncyclic changes in the Earth's orbit that\nmay affect climate\nneritic zone\npart of the ocean that extends from low tide to\nthe edge of the continental shelf\nnet primary productivity\nmeasurement of the energy\naccumulation within an ecosystem, calculated as the total\namount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is\noxidized during cellular respiration\nocean upwelling\nrising of deep ocean waters that occurs\nwhen prevailing winds blow along surface waters near a\ncoastline\noceanic zone\npart of the ocean that begins offshore where\nthe water measures 200 m deep or deeper\npelagic realm\n(also, pelagic zone) open ocean waters that\nare not close to the bottom or near the shore\npermafrost\nperennially frozen portion of the Arctic tundra\nsoil\nphotic zone\nportion of the ocean that light can penetrate\nplanktivore\nanimal species that eats plankton\npredator\norganism that kills and consumes another\norganism\nSargassum\ntype of free-floating marine seaweed\nsolar intensity\namount of solar power energy the sun emits\nin a given amount of time\nsource water\npoint of origin of a river or stream\nthermocline\nlayer of water with a temperature that is\nsignificantly different from that of the surrounding layers\nweather\nconditions of the atmosphere during a short\nperiod of time\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n44.1 The Scope of Ecology\nEcology is the study of the interactions of living things with\ntheir environment. Ecologists ask questions that comprise\nfour levels of general biological organization\u2014organismal,\npopulation, community, and ecosystem. At the organismal\nlevel, ecologists study individual organisms and how they\ninteract with their environments. At the population and\ncommunity levels, ecologists explore, respectively, how a\npopulation of organisms changes over time and the ways in\nwhich that population interacts with other species in the\nChapter 44 \u2022 Key Terms\n1291\ncommunity. Ecologists studying an ecosystem examine the\nliving species (the biotic components) of the ecosystem as\nwell as the nonliving portions (the abiotic components), such\nas air, water, and soil, of the environment.\n44.2 Biogeography\nBiogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of\nliving things as well as the abiotic factors that affect their\ndistribution. Endemic species are species that are naturally\nfound only in a specific geographic area. The distribution of\nliving things is influenced by several environmental factors\nthat are, in part, controlled by the latitude or elevation at\nwhich a species is found. Ocean upwellings, and spring and\nfall turnovers are important processes regulating the\ndistribution of nutrients and other abiotic factors important\nin aquatic ecosystems. Energy sources, temperature, water,\ninorganic nutrients, and soil are factors limiting the\ndistribution of living things in terrestrial systems. Net\nprimary productivity is a measure of the amount of biomass\nproduced by a biome.\n44.3 Terrestrial Biomes\nThe Earth has terrestrial biomes and aquatic biomes. Aquatic\nbiomes include both freshwater and marine environments.\nThere are eight major terrestrial biomes: tropical wet forests,\nsavannas, subtropical deserts, chaparral, temperate\ngrasslands, temperate forests, boreal forests, and Arctic\ntundra. The same biome can occur in different geographic\nlocations with similar climates. Temperature and\nprecipitation, and variations in both, are key abiotic factors\nthat shape the composition of animal and plant communities\nin terrestrial biomes. Some biomes, such as temperate\ngrasslands and temperate forests, have distinct seasons,\nwith cold weather and hot weather alternating throughout\nthe year. In warm, moist biomes, such as the tropical wet\nforest, net primary productivity is high, as warm\ntemperatures, abundant water, and a year-round growing\nseason fuel plant growth and supply energy for high diversity\nthroughout the food web. Other biomes, such as deserts and\ntundras, have low primary productivity due to extreme\ntemperatures and a shortage of available water.\n44.4 Aquatic Biomes\nAquatic ecosystems include both saltwater and freshwater\nbiomes. The abiotic factors important for the structuring of\naquatic ecosystems can be different than those seen in\nterrestrial systems. Sunlight is a driving force behind the\nstructure of forests and also is an important factor in bodies\nof water, especially those that are very deep, because of the\nrole of photosynthesis in sustaining certain organisms.\nDensity and temperature shape the structure of aquatic\nsystems. Oceans may be thought of as consisting of different\nzones based on water depth and distance from the shoreline\nand light penetrance. Different kinds of organisms are\nadapted to the conditions found in each zone. Coral reefs are\nunique marine ecosystems that are home to a wide variety of\nspecies. Estuaries are found where rivers meet the ocean;\ntheir shallow waters provide nourishment and shelter for\nyoung crustaceans, mollusks, fishes, and many other\nspecies. Freshwater biomes include lakes, ponds, rivers,\nstreams, and wetlands. Bogs are an interesting type of\nwetland characterized by standing water, lower pH, and a\nlack of nitrogen.\n44.5 Climate and the Effects of\nGlobal Climate Change\nThe Earth has gone through periodic cycles of increases and\ndecreases in temperature. During the past 2,000 years, the\nMedieval Climate Anomaly was a warmer period, while the\nLittle Ice Age was unusually cool. Both of these irregularities\ncan be explained by natural causes of changes in climate,\nand, although the temperature changes were small, they had\nsignificant effects. Natural drivers of climate change include\nMilankovitch cycles, changes in solar activity, and volcanic\neruptions. None of these factors, however, leads to rapid\nincreases in global temperature or sustained increases in\ncarbon dioxide.\nThe burning of fossil fuels is an important source of\ngreenhouse gases, which play a major role in the greenhouse\neffect. Two hundred and fifty million years ago, global\nwarming resulted in the Permian extinction: a large-scale\nextinction event that is documented in the fossil record.\nCurrently, modern-day climate change is associated with the\nincreased melting of glaciers and polar ice sheets, resulting\nin a gradual increase in sea level. Plants and animals can also\nbe affected by global climate change when the timing of\nseasonal events, such as flowering or pollination, is affected\nby global warming.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

Populations consist all of the species living within a specific area, and\npopulations fluctuate based on a number of factors: seasonal and yearly changes in the environment, natural\ndisasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions, and competition for resources between and within\nspecies. The statistical study of population dynamics, demography, uses a series of mathematical tools to\ninvestigate how populations respond to changes in their biotic and abiotic environments. Many of these\ntools were originally designed to study human populations. For example, life tables, which detail the life\nexpectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance companies to set\ninsurance rates. In fact, while the term \u201cdemographics\u201d is commonly used when discussing humans, all\nliving populations can be studied using this approach.\nPopulation Size and Density\nThe study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species\nexist, and how closely associated they are with each other. Within a particular habitat, a population can be\ncharacterized by its population size (N), the total number of individuals, and its population density, the\nnumber of individuals within a specific area or volume. Population size and density are the two main\ncharacteristics used to describe and understand populations. For example, populations with more\nindividuals may be more stable than smaller populations based on their genetic variability, and thus their\npotential to adapt to the environment. Alternatively, a member of a population with low population density\n(more spread out in the habitat), might have more difficulty finding a mate to reproduce compared to a\npopulation of higher density. As is shown in Figure 45.2, smaller organisms tend to be more densely\ndistributed than larger organisms.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 45.2 Australian mammals show a typical inverse relationship between population density and body size.\nAs this graph shows, population density typically decreases with increasing body size. Why do you think this\n1296\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nis the case?\nPopulation Research Methods\nThe most accurate way to determine population size is to simply count all of the individuals within the habitat. However, this\nmethod is often not logistically or economically feasible, especially when studying large habitats. Thus, scientists usually study\npopulations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat and using this data to make inferences about the habitat as a\nwhole. A variety of methods can be used to sample populations to determine their size and density. For immobile organisms\nsuch as plants, or for very small and slow-moving organisms, a quadrat may be used (Figure 45.3). A quadrat is a way of marking\noff square areas within a habitat, either by staking out an area with sticks and string, or by the use of a wood, plastic, or metal\nsquare placed on the ground. After setting the quadrats, researchers then count the number of individuals that lie within their\nboundaries. Multiple quadrat samples are performed throughout the habitat at several random locations to estimate the\npopulation size and density within the entire habitat. The number and size of quadrat samples depends on the type of\norganisms under study and other factors, including the density of the organism. For example, if sampling daffodils, a 1 m2\nquadrat might be used. With giant redwoods, on the other hand, a larger quadrat of 100 m2 might be employed. This ensures\nthat enough individuals of the species are counted to get an accurate sample that correlates with the habitat, including areas not\nsampled.\nFigure 45.3 A scientist uses a quadrat to measure population size and density. (credit: NPS Sonoran Desert Network)\nFor mobile organisms, such as mammals, birds, or fish, scientists use a technique called mark and recapture. This method\ninvolves marking a sample of captured animals in some way (such as tags, bands, paint, or other body markings), and then\nreleasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population. Later, researchers collect a new\nsample, including some individuals that are marked (recaptures) and some individuals that are unmarked (Figure 45.4).\nFigure 45.4 Mark and recapture is used to measure the population size of mobile animals such as (a) bighorn sheep, (b) the California\ncondor, and (c) salmon. (credit a: modification of work by Neal Herbert, NPS; credit b: modification of work by Pacific Southwest Region\nUSFWS; credit c: modification of work by Ingrid Taylar)\nUsing the ratio of marked and unmarked individuals, scientists determine how many individuals are in the sample. From this,\ncalculations are used to estimate the total population size. This method assumes that the larger the population, the lower the\npercentage of tagged organisms that will be recaptured since they will have mixed with more untagged individuals. For example,\n45.1 \u2022 Population Demography\n1297\nif 80 deer are captured, tagged, and released into the forest, and later 100 deer are captured and 20 of them are already marked,\nwe can estimate the population size (N) using the following equation:\nUsing our example, the population size would be estimated at 400.\nTherefore, there are an estimated 400 total individuals in the original population.\nThere are some limitations to the mark and recapture method. Some animals from the first catch may learn to avoid capture in\nthe second round, thus inflating population estimates. Alternatively, some animals may prefer to be retrapped (especially if a\nfood reward is offered), resulting in an underestimate of population size. Also, some species may be harmed by the marking\ntechnique, reducing their survival. A variety of other techniques have been developed, including the electronic tracking of\nanimals tagged with radio transmitters and the use of data from commercial fishing and trapping operations to estimate the\nsize and health of populations and communities.\nSpecies Distribution\nIn addition to measuring simple density, further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the distribution\nof the individuals. Species dispersion patterns (or distribution patterns) show the spatial relationship between members of a\npopulation within a habitat at a particular point in time. In other words, they show whether members of the species live close\ntogether or far apart, and what patterns are evident when they are spaced apart.\nIndividuals in a population can be equally spaced apart, dispersed randomly with no predictable pattern, or clustered in groups.\nThese are known as uniform, random, and clumped dispersion patterns, respectively (Figure 45.5). Uniform dispersion is\nobserved in plants that secrete substances inhibiting the growth of nearby individuals (such as the release of toxic chemicals by\nthe sage plant Salvia leucophylla, a phenomenon called allelopathy) and in animals like the penguin that maintain a defined\nterritory. An example of random dispersion occurs with dandelion and other plants that have wind-dispersed seeds that\ngerminate wherever they happen to fall in a favorable environment. A clumped dispersion may be seen in plants that drop their\nseeds straight to the ground, such as oak trees, or in animals that live in groups (schools of fish or herds of elephants). Clumped\ndispersions may also be a function of habitat heterogeneity. Thus, the dispersion of the individuals within a population provides\nmore information about how they interact with each other than does a simple density measurement. Just as lower density\nspecies might have more difficulty finding a mate, solitary species with a random distribution might have a similar difficulty\nwhen compared to social species clumped together in groups.\nFigure 45.5 Species may have uniform, random, or clumped distribution. Territorial birds such as penguins tend to have uniform\ndistribution. Plants such as dandelions with wind-dispersed seeds tend to be randomly distributed. Animals such as elephants that travel in\ngroups exhibit clumped distribution. (credit a: modification of work by Ben Tubby; credit b: modification of work by Rosendahl; credit c:\nmodification of work by Rebecca Wood)\nDemography\nWhile population size and density describe a population at one particular point in time, scientists must use demography to\n1298\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nstudy the dynamics of a population. Demography is the statistical study of population changes over time: birth rates, death\nrates, and life expectancies. Each of these measures, especially birth rates, may be affected by the population characteristics\ndescribed above. For example, a large population size results in a higher birth rate because more potentially reproductive\nindividuals are present. In contrast, a large population size can also result in a higher death rate because of competition,\ndisease, and the accumulation of waste. Similarly, a higher population density or a clumped dispersion pattern results in more\npotential reproductive encounters between individuals, which can increase birth rate. Lastly, a female-biased sex ratio (the ratio\nof males to females) or age structure (the proportion of population members at specific age ranges) composed of many\nindividuals of reproductive age can increase birth rates.\nIn addition, the demographic characteristics of a population can influence how the population grows or declines over time. If\nbirth and death rates are equal, the population remains stable. However, the population size will increase if birth rates exceed\ndeath rates; the population will decrease if birth rates are less than death rates. Life expectancy is another important factor; the\nlength of time individuals remain in the population impacts local resources, reproduction, and the overall health of the\npopulation. These demographic characteristics are often displayed in the form of a life table.\nLife Tables\nLife tables provide important information about the life history of an organism. Life tables divide the population into age\ngroups and often sexes, and show how long a member of that group is likely to live. They are modeled after actuarial tables used\nby the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy. Life tables may include the probability of individuals dying\nbefore their next birthday (i.e., their mortality rate), the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval,\nand their life expectancy at each interval. An example of a life table is shown in Table 45.1 from a study of Dall mountain sheep, a\nspecies native to northwestern North America. Notice that the population is divided into age intervals (column A). The mortality\nrate (per 1000), shown in column D, is based on the number of individuals dying during the age interval (column B) divided by\nthe number of individuals surviving at the beginning of the interval (Column C), multiplied by 1000.\nFor example, between ages three and four, 12 individuals die out of the 776 that were remaining from the original 1000 sheep.\nThis number is then multiplied by 1000 to get the mortality rate per thousand.\nAs can be seen from the mortality rate data (column D), a high death rate occurred when the sheep were between 6 and 12\nmonths old, and then increased even more from 8 to 12 years old, after which there were few survivors. The data indicate that if\na sheep in this population were to survive to age one, it could be expected to live another 7.7 years on average, as shown by the\nlife expectancy numbers in column E.\nLife Table of Dall Mountain Sheep1\nAge\ninterval\n(years)\nNumber dying\nin age interval\nout of 1000\nborn\nNumber surviving at\nbeginning of age\ninterval out of 1000\nborn\nMortality rate per\n1000 alive at\nbeginning of age\ninterval\nLife expectancy or mean\nlifetime remaining to those\nattaining age interval\n0-0.5\n54\n1000\n54.0\n7.06\n0.5-1\n145\n946\n153.3\n--\n1-2\n12\n801\n15.0\n7.7\n2-3\n13\n789\n16.5\n6.8\nTable 45.1 This life table of Ovis dalli shows the number of deaths, number of survivors, mortality rate, and life expectancy at\n1Data Adapted from Edward S.

These curves allow us to compare the life\nhistories of different populations (Figure 45.6). Humans and most primates exhibit a Type I survivorship curve because a high\npercentage of offspring survive their early and middle years\u2014death occurs predominantly in older individuals. These types of\nspecies usually have small numbers of offspring at one time, and they give a high amount of parental care to them to ensure\ntheir survival. Birds are an example of an intermediate or Type II survivorship curve because birds die more or less equally at\neach age interval. These organisms also may have relatively few offspring and provide significant parental care. Trees, marine\ninvertebrates, and most fishes exhibit a Type III survivorship curve because very few of these organisms survive their younger\nyears; however, those that make it to an old age are more likely to survive for a relatively long period of time. Organisms in this\ncategory usually have a very large number of offspring, but once they are born, little parental care is provided. Thus these\noffspring are \u201con their own\u201d and vulnerable to predation, but their sheer numbers assure the survival of enough individuals to\nperpetuate the species.\n283-314.\n1300\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 45.6 Survivorship curves show the distribution of individuals in a population according to age. Humans and most mammals have a\nType I survivorship curve because death primarily occurs in the older years. Birds have a Type II survivorship curve, as death at any age is\nequally probable. Trees have a Type III survivorship curve because very few survive the younger years, but after a certain age, individuals\nare much more likely to survive.\n45.2 Life Histories and Natural Selection\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe how life history patterns are influenced by natural selection\n\u2022\nExplain different life history patterns and how different reproductive strategies affect species\u2019 survival\nA species\u2019 life history describes the series of events over its lifetime, such as how resources are allocated for growth,\nmaintenance, and reproduction. Life history traits affect the life table of an organism. A species\u2019 life history is genetically\ndetermined and shaped by the environment and natural selection.\nLife History Patterns and Energy Budgets\nEnergy is required by all living organisms for their growth, maintenance, and reproduction; at the same time, energy is often a\nmajor limiting factor in determining an organism\u2019s survival. Plants, for example, acquire energy from the sun via\nphotosynthesis, but must expend this energy to grow, maintain health, and produce energy-rich seeds to produce the next\ngeneration. Animals have the additional burden of using some of their energy reserves to acquire food. Furthermore, some\nanimals must expend energy caring for their offspring. Thus, all species have an energy budget: they must balance energy intake\nwith their use of energy for metabolism, reproduction, parental care, and energy storage (such as bears building up body fat for\nwinter hibernation).\nParental Care and Fecundity\nFecundity is the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population. In other words, fecundity describes how\nmany offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible, repeating the reproductive cycle as\nsoon as possible after the birth of the offspring. In animals, fecundity is inversely related to the amount of parental care given to\nan individual offspring. Species, such as many marine invertebrates, that produce many offspring usually provide little if any\ncare for the offspring (they would not have the energy or the ability to do so anyway). Most of their energy budget is used to\nproduce many tiny offspring. Animals with this strategy are often self-sufficient at a very early age. This is because of the energy\ntradeoff these organisms have made to maximize their evolutionary fitness. Because their energy is used for producing\noffspring instead of parental care, it makes sense that these offspring have some ability to be able to move within their\nenvironment and find food and perhaps shelter. Even with these abilities, their small size makes them extremely vulnerable to\npredation, so the production of many offspring allows enough of them to survive to maintain the species.\nAnimal species that have few offspring during a reproductive event usually give extensive parental care, devoting much of their\nenergy budget to these activities, sometimes at the expense of their own health. This is the case with many mammals, such as\nhumans, kangaroos, and pandas. The offspring of these species are relatively helpless at birth and need to develop before they\n45.2 \u2022 Life Histories and Natural Selection\n1301\nachieve self-sufficiency.\nPlants with low fecundity produce few energy-rich seeds (such as coconuts and chestnuts) with each having a good chance to\ngerminate into a new organism; plants with high fecundity usually have many small, energy-poor seeds (like orchids) that have a\nrelatively poor chance of surviving. Although it may seem that coconuts and chestnuts have a better chance of surviving, the\nenergy tradeoff of the orchid is also very effective. It is a matter of where the energy is used, for large numbers of seeds or for\nfewer seeds with more energy.\nEarly versus Late Reproduction\nThe timing of reproduction in a life history also affects species survival. Organisms that reproduce at an early age have a greater\nchance of producing offspring, but this is usually at the expense of their growth and the maintenance of their health.\nConversely, organisms that start reproducing later in life often have greater fecundity or are better able to provide parental care,\nbut they risk that they will not survive to reproductive age. Examples of this can be seen in fishes. Small fish, like guppies, use\ntheir energy to reproduce rapidly, but never attain the size that would give them defense against some predators. Larger fish,\nlike the bluegill or shark, use their energy to attain a large size, but do so with the risk that they will die before they can\nreproduce or at least reproduce to their maximum. These different energy strategies and tradeoffs are key to understanding the\nevolution of each species as it maximizes its fitness and fills its niche. In terms of energy budgeting, some species \u201cblow it all\u201d\nand use up most of their energy reserves to reproduce early before they die. Other species delay having reproduction to become\nstronger, more experienced individuals and to make sure that they are strong enough to provide parental care if necessary.\nSingle versus Multiple Reproductive Events\nSome life history traits, such as fecundity, timing of reproduction, and parental care, can be grouped together into general\nstrategies that are used by multiple species. Semelparity occurs when a species reproduces only once during its lifetime and\nthen dies. Such species use most of their resource budget during a single reproductive event, sacrificing their health to the point\nthat they do not survive. Examples of semelparity are bamboo, which flowers once and then dies, and the Chinook salmon\n(Figure 45.7a), which uses most of its energy reserves to migrate from the ocean to its freshwater nesting area, where it\nreproduces and then dies. Scientists have posited alternate explanations for the evolutionary advantage of the Chinook\u2019s post-\nreproduction death: a programmed suicide caused by a massive release of corticosteroid hormones, presumably so the parents\ncan become food for the offspring, or simple exhaustion caused by the energy demands of reproduction; these are still being\ndebated.\nIteroparity describes species that reproduce repeatedly during their lives. Some animals are able to mate only once per year, but\nsurvive multiple mating seasons. The pronghorn antelope is an example of an animal that goes into a seasonal estrus cycle\n(\u201cheat\u201d): a hormonally induced physiological condition preparing the body for successful mating (Figure 45.7b). Females of these\nspecies mate only during the estrus phase of the cycle. A different pattern is observed in primates, including humans and\nchimpanzees, which may attempt reproduction at any time during their reproductive years, even though their menstrual cycles\nmake pregnancy likely only a few days per month during ovulation (Figure 45.7c).\nFigure 45.7 The (a) Chinook salmon mates once and dies. The (b) pronghorn antelope mates during specific times of the year during its\nreproductive life. Primates, such as humans and (c) chimpanzees, may mate on any day, independent of ovulation.

Some of this work has been done using the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Studies\nhave shown that not only does reproduction have a cost as far as how long male fruit flies live, but also fruit flies that have\nalready mated several times have limited sperm remaining for reproduction. Fruit flies maximize their last chances at\nreproduction by selecting optimal mates.\nIn a 1981 study, male fruit flies were placed in enclosures with either virgin or inseminated females. The males that mated with\nvirgin females had shorter life spans than those in contact with the same number of inseminated females with which they were\nunable to mate. This effect occurred regardless of how large (indicative of their age) the males were. Thus, males that did not\nmate lived longer, allowing them more opportunities to find mates in the future.\nMore recent studies, performed in 2006, show how males select the female with which they will mate and how this is affected by\nprevious matings (Figure 45.8).2 Males were allowed to select between smaller and larger females. Findings showed that larger\nfemales had greater fecundity, producing twice as many offspring per mating as the smaller females did. Males that had\npreviously mated, and thus had lower supplies of sperm, were termed \u201cresource-depleted,\u201d while males that had not mated were\ntermed \u201cnon-resource-depleted.\u201d The study showed that although non-resource-depleted males preferentially mated with larger\nfemales, this selection of partners was more pronounced in the resource-depleted males. Thus, males with depleted sperm\nsupplies, which were limited in the number of times that they could mate before they replenished their sperm supply, selected\nlarger, more fecund females, thus maximizing their chances for offspring. This study was one of the first to show that the\nphysiological state of the male affected its mating behavior in a way that clearly maximizes its use of limited reproductive\nresources.\nFigure 45.8 Male fruit flies that had previously mated (sperm-depleted) picked larger, more fecund females more often than those that had\nnot mated (non-sperm-depleted). This change in behavior causes an increase in the efficiency of a limited reproductive resource: sperm.\nThese studies demonstrate two ways in which the energy budget is a factor in reproduction. First, energy expended on mating\nmay reduce an animal\u2019s lifespan, but by this time they have already reproduced, so in the context of natural selection this early\ndeath is not of much evolutionary importance. Second, when resources such as sperm (and the energy needed to replenish it)\nare low, an organism\u2019s behavior can change to give them the best chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. These\nchanges in behavior, so important to evolution, are studied in a discipline known as behavioral biology, or ethology, at the\ninterface between population biology and psychology.\n45.3 Environmental Limits to Population Growth\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nExplain the characteristics of and differences between exponential and logistic growth patterns\n\u2022\nGive examples of exponential and logistic growth in natural populations\n\u2022\nDescribe how natural selection and environmental adaptation led to the evolution of particular life history\npatterns\nAlthough life histories describe the way many characteristics of a population (such as their age structure) change over time in a\ngeneral way, population ecologists make use of a variety of methods to model population dynamics mathematically.

Malthus\npublished a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly, and then population\ngrowth decreases as resources become depleted. This accelerating pattern of increasing population size is called exponential\ngrowth.\nThe best example of exponential growth is seen in bacteria. Bacteria reproduce by prokaryotic fission. This division takes about\nan hour for many bacterial species. If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an unlimited supply of nutrients (so the\nnutrients will not become depleted), after an hour, there is one round of division and each organism divides, resulting in 2000\norganisms\u2014an increase of 1000. In another hour, each of the 2000 organisms will double, producing 4000, an increase of 2000\norganisms. After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask, an increase of 4000 organisms. The important\nconcept of exponential growth is the accelerating population growth rate\u2014the number of organisms added in each\nreproductive generation\u2014that is, it is increasing at a greater and greater rate. After 1 day and 24 of these cycles, the population\nwould have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion. When the population size, N, is plotted over time, a J-shaped growth\ncurve is produced (Figure 45.9).\nThe bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited. Furthermore, some bacteria will die\nduring the experiment and thus not reproduce, lowering the growth rate. Therefore, when calculating the growth rate of a\npopulation, the death rate (D) (number organisms that die during a particular time interval) is subtracted from the birth rate (B)\n(number organisms that are born during that interval). This is shown in the following formula:\nThe birth rate is usually expressed on a per capita (for each individual) basis. Thus, B (birth rate) = bN (the per capita birth rate\n\u201cb\u201d multiplied by the number of individuals \u201cN\u201d) and D (death rate) = dN (the per capita death rate \u201cd\u201d multiplied by the number\nof individuals \u201cN\u201d). Additionally, ecologists are interested in the population at a particular point in time, an infinitely small time\ninterval. For this reason, the terminology of differential calculus is used to obtain the \u201cinstantaneous\u201d growth rate, replacing the\nchange in number and time with an instant-specific measurement of number and time.\nNotice that the \u201cd\u201d associated with the first term refers to the derivative (as the term is used in calculus) and is different from the\ndeath rate, also called \u201cd.\u201d The difference between birth and death rates is further simplified by substituting the term \u201cr\u201d\n(intrinsic rate of increase) for the relationship between birth and death rates:\nThe value \u201cr\u201d can be positive, meaning the population is increasing in size; or negative, meaning the population is decreasing in\nsize; or zero, where the population\u2019s size is unchanging, a condition known as zero population growth. A further refinement of\nthe formula recognizes that different species have inherent differences in their intrinsic rate of increase (often thought of as the\npotential for reproduction), even under ideal conditions. Obviously, a bacterium can reproduce more rapidly and have a higher\nintrinsic rate of growth than a human. The maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic potential, or rmax, thus changing the\nequation to:\n1304\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 45.9 When resources are unlimited, populations exhibit exponential growth, resulting in a J-shaped curve. When resources are\nlimited, populations exhibit logistic growth. In logistic growth, population expansion decreases as resources become scarce, and it levels\noff when the carrying capacity of the environment is reached, resulting in an S-shaped curve.\nLogistic Growth\nExponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not the case in the real world. Charles\nDarwin recognized this fact in his description of the \u201cstruggle for existence,\u201d which states that individuals will compete (with\nmembers of their own or other species) for limited resources. The successful ones will survive to pass on their own\ncharacteristics and traits (which we know now are transferred by genes) to the next generation at a greater rate (natural\nselection). To model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed the logistic growth model.\nCarrying Capacity and the Logistic Model\nIn the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. Exponential growth may occur in\nenvironments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals gets large enough,\nresources will be depleted, slowing the growth rate. Eventually, the growth rate will plateau or level off (Figure 45.9). This\npopulation size, which represents the maximum population size that a particular environment can support, is called the\ncarrying capacity, or K.\nThe formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate. The\nexpression \u201cK \u2013 N\u201d indicates how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage, and \u201cK \u2013 N\u201d divided by \u201cK\u201d is\nthe fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth. Thus, the exponential growth model is restricted by this factor\nto generate the logistic growth equation:\nNotice that when N is very small, (K-N)/K becomes close to K/K or 1, and the right side of the equation reduces to rmaxN, which\nmeans the population is growing exponentially and is not influenced by carrying capacity. On the other hand, when N is large,\n(K-N)/K comes close to zero, which means that population growth will be slowed greatly or even stopped. Thus, population\ngrowth is greatly slowed in large populations by the carrying capacity K. This model also allows for the population of a negative\npopulation growth, or a population decline. This occurs when the number of individuals in the population exceeds the carrying\ncapacity (because the value of (K-N)/K is negative).\nA graph of this equation yields an S-shaped curve (Figure 45.9), and it is a more realistic model of population growth than\nexponential growth. There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve. Initially, growth is exponential because there are\nfew individuals and ample resources available. Then, as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases. Finally,\ngrowth levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population size over time.\nRole of Intraspecific Competition\nThe logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal\nchance for survival. For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and the space to grow are the important resources,\nwhereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates.\n45.3 \u2022 Environmental Limits to Population Growth\n1305\nIn the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better\nadapted to their environment than others. The resulting competition between population members of the same species for\nresources is termed intraspecific competition (intra- = \u201cwithin\u201d; -specific = \u201cspecies\u201d). Intraspecific competition for resources\nmay not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity\u2014resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain\nwhat they need. However, as population size increases, this competition intensifies. In addition, the accumulation of waste\nproducts can reduce an environment\u2019s carrying capacity.\nExamples of Logistic Growth\nYeast, a microscopic fungus used to make bread and alcoholic beverages, exhibits the classical S-shaped curve when grown in a\ntest tube (Figure 45.10a). Its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients. In the real world, however, there are\nvariations to this idealized curve. Examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals (Figure 45.10b). In both\nexamples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls below the carrying capacity\nafterwards. This fluctuation in population size continues to occur as the population oscillates around its carrying capacity. Still,\neven with this oscillation, the logistic model is confirmed.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 45.10 (a) Yeast grown in ideal conditions in a test tube show a classical S-shaped logistic growth curve, whereas (b) a natural\npopulation of seals shows real-world fluctuation.\nIf the major food source of the seals declines due to pollution or overfishing, which of the following would likely occur?\n1306\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\na.\nThe carrying capacity of seals would decrease, as would the seal population.\nb.\nThe carrying capacity of seals would decrease, but the seal population would remain the same.\nc.\nThe number of seal deaths would increase but the number of births would also increase, so the population size would\nremain the same.\nd.\nThe carrying capacity of seals would remain the same, but the population of seals would decrease.\n45.4 Population Dynamics and Regulation\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nGive examples of how the carrying capacity of a habitat may change\n\u2022\nCompare and contrast density-dependent growth regulation and density-independent growth regulation,\ngiving examples\n\u2022\nGive examples of exponential and logistic growth in wild animal populations\n\u2022\nDescribe how natural selection and environmental adaptation leads to the evolution of particular life-history\npatterns\nThe logistic model of population growth, while valid in many natural populations and a useful model, is a simplification of real-\nworld population dynamics. Implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change, which is not\nthe case. The carrying capacity varies annually: for example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others are cold and wet. In\nmany areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer. Also, natural events such as\nearthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity. Additionally, populations do not\nusually exist in isolation. They engage in interspecific competition: that is, they share the environment with other species\ncompeting for the same resources. These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow.\nNature regulates population growth in a variety of ways. These are grouped into density-dependent factors, in which the density\nof the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality, and density-independent factors, which influence mortality\nin a population regardless of population density. Note that in the former, the effect of the factor on the population depends on\nthe density of the population at onset. Conservation biologists want to understand both types because this helps them manage\npopulations and prevent extinction or overpopulation.\nDensity-Dependent Regulation\nMost density-dependent factors are biological in nature (biotic), and include predation, inter- and intraspecific competition,\naccumulation of waste, and diseases such as those caused by parasites. Usually, the denser a population is, the greater its\nmortality rate. For example, during intra- and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of the individuals will usually be\nlower, reducing their population\u2019s rate of growth. In addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its predator because it\nhas more difficulty locating its food source.\nAn example of density-dependent regulation is shown in Figure 45.11 with results from a study focusing on the giant intestinal\nroundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), a parasite of humans and other mammals.3 Denser populations of the parasite exhibited\nlower fecundity: they contained fewer eggs. One possible explanation for this is that females would be smaller in more dense\npopulations (due to limited resources) and that smaller females would have fewer eggs. This hypothesis was tested and\ndisproved in a 2009 study which showed that female weight had no influence.4 The actual cause of the density-dependence of\nfecundity in this organism is still unclear and awaiting further investigation.\n3N.A. Croll et al., \u201cThe Population Biology and Control of Ascaris lumbricoides in a Rural Community in Iran.\u201d Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical\nMedicine and Hygiene 76, no. 2 (1982): 187-197, doi:10.1016/0035-9203(82)90272-3.\n4Martin Walker et al., \u201cDensity-Dependent Effects on the Weight of Female Ascaris lumbricoides Infections of Humans and its Impact on Patterns of Egg\nProduction.\u201d Parasites & Vectors 2, no. 11 (February 2009), doi:10.1186/1756-3305-2-11.\n45.4 \u2022 Population Dynamics and Regulation\n1307\nFigure 45.11 In this population of roundworms, fecundity (number of eggs) decreases with population density.5\nDensity-Independent Regulation and Interaction with Density-Dependent\nFactors\nMany factors, typically physical or chemical in nature (abiotic), influence the mortality of a population regardless of its density,\nincluding weather, natural disasters, and pollution. An individual deer may be killed in a forest fire regardless of how many deer\nhappen to be in that area. Its chances of survival are the same whether the population density is high or low. The same holds true\nfor cold winter weather.\nIn real-life situations, population regulation is very complicated and density-dependent and independent factors can interact. A\ndense population that is reduced in a density-independent manner by some environmental factor(s) will be able to recover\ndifferently than a sparse population. For example, a population of deer affected by a harsh winter will recover faster if there are\nmore deer remaining to reproduce.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nWhy Did the Woolly Mammoth Go Extinct?\nFigure 45.12 The three photos include: (a) 1916 mural of a mammoth herd from the American Museum of Natural History, (b) the only\nstuffed mammoth in the world, from the Museum of Zoology located in St. Petersburg, Russia, and (c) a one-month-old baby mammoth,\nnamed Lyuba, discovered in Siberia in 2007.

A 2012 study showed that no single factor was exclusively\nresponsible for the extinction of these magnificent creatures.7 In addition to human hunting, climate change, and reduction of\nhabitat, these scientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoth\u2019s extinction was the migration of humans\nacross the Bering Strait to North America during the last ice age 20,000 years ago.\nThe maintenance of stable populations was and is very complex, with many interacting factors determining the outcome. It is\nimportant to remember that humans are also part of nature. We once contributed to a species\u2019 decline using only primitive\nhunting technology.\nLife Histories of K-selected and r-selected Species\nWhile reproductive strategies play a key role in life histories, they do not account for important factors like limited resources\nand competition. The regulation of population growth by these factors can be used to introduce a classical concept in population\nbiology, that of K-selected versus r-selected species.\nThe concept relates to a species\u2019 reproductive strategies, habitat, and behavior, especially in the way that they obtain resources\nand care for their young. It includes length of life and survivorship factors as well. Population biologists have grouped species\ninto the two large categories\u2014K-selected and r-selected\u2014although the categories are really two ends of a continuum.\nK-selected species are species selected by stable, predictable environments. Populations of K-selected species tend to exist close\nto their carrying capacity (hence the term K-selected) where intraspecific competition is high. These species have few, large\noffspring, a long gestation period, and often give long-term care to their offspring (Table 45.2). While larger in size when born,\nthe offspring are relatively helpless and immature at birth. By the time they reach adulthood, they must develop skills to\ncompete for natural resources. In plants, scientists think of parental care more broadly: how long fruit takes to develop or how\nlong it remains on the plant are determining factors in the time to the next reproductive event. Examples of K-selected species\nare primates (including humans), elephants, and plants such as oak trees (Figure 45.13a).\nOak trees grow very slowly and take, on average, 20 years to produce their first seeds, known as acorns. As many as 50,000\nacorns can be produced by an individual tree, but the germination rate is low as many of these rot or are eaten by animals such\nas squirrels. In some years, oaks may produce an exceptionally large number of acorns, and these years may be on a two- or\nthree-year cycle depending on the species of oak (r-selection).\nAs oak trees grow to a large size and for many years before they begin to produce acorns, they devote a large percentage of their\nenergy budget to growth and maintenance. The tree\u2019s height and size allow it to dominate other plants in the competition for\nsunlight, the oak\u2019s primary energy resource. Furthermore, when it does reproduce, the oak produces large, energy-rich seeds\nthat use their energy reserve to become quickly established (K-selection).\nIn contrast, r-selected species have a large number of small offspring (hence their r designation (Table 45.2)). This strategy is\noften employed in unpredictable or changing environments. Animals that are r-selected do not give long-term parental care and\nthe offspring are relatively mature and self-sufficient at birth. Examples of r-selected species are marine invertebrates, such as\njellyfish, and plants, such as the dandelion (Figure 45.13b). Dandelions have small seeds that are wind dispersed long distances.\nMany seeds are produced simultaneously to ensure that at least some of them reach a hospitable environment. Seeds that land\nin inhospitable environments have little chance for survival since their seeds are low in energy content. Note that survival is not\nnecessarily a function of energy stored in the seed itself.\n6David Nogu\u00e9s-Bravo et al., \u201cClimate Change, Humans, and the Extinction of the Woolly Mammoth.\u201d PLoS Biol 6 (April 2008): e79, doi:10.1371/\njournal.pbio.0060079.\n7G.M.

(b) Dandelions and jellyfish are both considered r-selected species as they mature early, have short lifespans, and\nproduce many offspring that receive no parental care.\nModern Theories of Life History\nBy the second half of the twentieth century, the concept of K- and r-selected species was used extensively and successfully to\nstudy populations. The r- and K-selection theory, although accepted for decades and used for much groundbreaking research,\nhas now been reconsidered, and many population biologists have abandoned or modified it. Over the years, several studies\nattempted to confirm the theory, but these attempts have largely failed. Many species were identified that did not follow the\n1310\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ntheory\u2019s predictions. Furthermore, the theory ignored the age-specific mortality of the populations which scientists now know\nis very important. New demographic-based models of life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many\necological concepts included in r- and K-selection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors.\n45.5 Human Population Growth\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss exponential human population growth\n\u2022\nExplain how humans have expanded the carrying capacity of their habitat\n\u2022\nRelate population growth and age structure to the level of economic development in different countries\n\u2022\nDiscuss the long-term implications of unchecked human population growth\nPopulation dynamics can be applied to human population growth. Earth\u2019s human population is growing rapidly, to the extent\nthat some worry about the ability of the earth\u2019s environment to sustain this population. Long-term exponential growth carries\nthe potential risks of famine, disease, and large-scale death.\nAlthough humans have increased the carrying capacity of their environment, the technologies used to achieve this\ntransformation have caused unprecedented changes to Earth\u2019s environment, altering ecosystems to the point where some may\nbe in danger of collapse. The depletion of the ozone layer, erosion due to acid rain, and damage from global climate change are\ncaused by human activities. The ultimate effect of these changes on our carrying capacity is unknown. As some point out, it is\nlikely that the negative effects of increasing carrying capacity will outweigh the positive ones\u2014the world\u2019s carrying capacity for\nhuman beings might actually decrease.\nThe human population is currently experiencing exponential growth even though human reproduction is far below its biotic\npotential (Figure 45.14). To reach its biotic potential, all females would have to become pregnant every nine months or so during\ntheir reproductive years. Also, resources would have to be such that the environment would support such growth. Neither of\nthese two conditions exists. In spite of this fact, human population is still growing exponentially.\nFigure 45.14 Human population growth since 1000 AD is exponential (dark blue line). Notice that while the population in Asia (yellow line),\nwhich has many economically underdeveloped countries, is increasing exponentially, the population in Europe (light blue line), where most\nof the countries are economically developed, is growing much more slowly.\nA consequence of exponential human population growth is a reduction in time that it takes to add a particular number of\nhumans to the Earth. Figure 45.15 shows that 123 years were necessary to add 1 billion humans in 1930, but it only took 24 years\nto add two billion people between 1975 and 1999. As already discussed, our ability to increase our carrying capacity indefinitely\nmy be limited. Without new technological advances, the human growth rate has been predicted to slow in the coming decades.\nHowever, the population will still be increasing and the threat of overpopulation remains.\n45.5 \u2022 Human Population Growth\n1311\nFigure 45.15 The time between the addition of each billion human beings to Earth decreases over time.

Cragun)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick through this video (http://openstax.org/l/human_growth) of how human populations have changed over time.\nOvercoming Density-Dependent Regulation\nHumans are unique in their ability to alter their environment with the conscious purpose of increasing carrying capacity. This\nability is a major factor responsible for human population growth and a way of overcoming density-dependent growth\nregulation. Much of this ability is related to human intelligence, society, and communication. Humans can construct shelter to\nprotect them from the elements and have developed agriculture and domesticated animals to increase their food supplies. In\naddition, humans use language to communicate this technology to new generations, allowing them to improve upon previous\naccomplishments.\nOther factors in human population growth are migration and public health. Humans originated in Africa, but have since\nmigrated to nearly all inhabitable land on the Earth. Public health, sanitation, and the use of antibiotics and vaccines have\ndecreased the ability of infectious disease to limit human population growth. In the past, diseases such as the bubonic plaque of\nthe fourteenth century killed between 30 and 60 percent of Europe\u2019s population and reduced the overall world population by as\nmany as 100 million people. Today, the threat of infectious disease, while not gone, is certainly less severe. According to the\nInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle, global death from infectious disease declined from 15.4 million in\n1990 to 10.4 million in 2017. To compare to some of the epidemics of the past, the percentage of the world's population killed\nbetween 1993 and 2002 decreased from 0.30 percent of the world's population to 0.14 percent. Thus, infectious disease influence\non human population growth is becoming less significant.\nAge Structure, Population Growth, and Economic Development\nThe age structure of a population is an important factor in population dynamics. Age structure is the proportion of a population\nat different age ranges. Age structure allows better prediction of population growth, plus the ability to associate this growth\nwith the level of economic development in the region. Countries with rapid growth have a pyramidal shape in their age structure\ndiagrams, showing a preponderance of younger individuals, many of whom are of reproductive age or will be soon (Figure\n45.16). This pattern is most often observed in underdeveloped countries where individuals do not live to old age because of less-\nthan-optimal living conditions. Age structures of areas with slow growth, including developed countries such as the United\nStates, still have a pyramidal structure, but with many fewer young and reproductive-aged individuals and a greater proportion\nof older individuals. Other developed countries, such as Italy, have zero population growth. The age structure of these\npopulations is more conical, with an even greater percentage of middle-aged and older individuals. The actual growth rates in\ndifferent countries are shown in Figure 45.17, with the highest rates tending to be in the less economically developed countries of\n1312\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nAfrica and Asia.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 45.16 Typical age structure diagrams are shown. The rapid growth diagram narrows to a point, indicating that the number of\nindividuals decreases rapidly with age. In the slow growth model, the number of individuals decreases steadily with age. Stable population\ndiagrams are rounded on the top, showing that the number of individuals per age group decreases gradually, and then increases for the\nolder part of the population.\nAge structure diagrams for rapidly growing, slow growing, and stable populations are shown in stages 1 through 3. What type of\npopulation change do you think stage 4 represents?\nFigure 45.17 The percent growth rate of population in different countries is shown. Notice that the highest growth is occurring in less\neconomically developed countries in Africa and Asia.\nLong-Term Consequences of Exponential Human Population Growth\nMany dire predictions have been made about the world\u2019s population leading to a major crisis called the \u201cpopulation explosion.\u201d\nIn the 1968 book The Population Bomb, biologist Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich wrote, \u201cThe battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s\nhundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing\ncan prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.\u201d8 While many experts view this statement as incorrect based on\nevidence, the laws of exponential population growth are still in effect, and unchecked human population growth cannot\ncontinue indefinitely.\nSeveral nations have instituted policies aimed at influencing population. Efforts to control population growth led to the one-\nchild policy in China, which is now being phased out. India also implements national and regional populations to encourage\nfamily planning. On the other hand, Japan, Spain, Russia, Iran, and other countries have made efforts to increase population\n8Paul R. Erlich, prologue to The Population Bomb, (1968; repr., New York: Ballantine, 1970).\n45.5 \u2022 Human Population Growth\n1313\ngrowth after birth rates dipped. Such policies are controversial, and the human population continues to grow. At some point the\nfood supply may run out, but the outcomes are difficult to predict. The United Nations estimates that future world population\ngrowth may vary from 6 billion (a decrease) to 16 billion people by the year 2100.\nAnother result of population growth is the endangerment of the natural environment. Many countries have attempted to reduce\nthe human impact on climate change by reducing their emission of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. However, these treaties\nhave not been ratified by every country. The role of human activity in causing climate change has become a hotly debated socio-\npolitical issue in some countries, including the United States. Thus, we enter the future with considerable uncertainty about our\nability to curb human population growth and protect our environment.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/populations) and select \u201cLaunch movie\u201d for an animation discussing the global impacts\nof human population growth.\n45.6 Community Ecology\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the predator-prey cycle\n\u2022\nGive examples of defenses against predation and herbivory\n\u2022\nDescribe the competitive exclusion principle\n\u2022\nGive examples of symbiotic relationships between species\n\u2022\nDescribe community structure and succession\nPopulations rarely, if ever, live in isolation from populations of other species. In most cases, numerous species share a habitat.\nThe interactions between these populations play a major role in regulating population growth and abundance. All populations\noccupying the same habitat form a community: populations inhabiting a specific area at the same time. The number of species\noccupying the same habitat and their relative abundance is known as species diversity. Areas with low diversity, such as the\nglaciers of Antarctica, still contain a wide variety of living things, whereas the diversity of tropical rainforests is so great that it\ncannot be counted. Ecology is studied at the community level to understand how species interact with each other and compete\nfor the same resources.\nPredation and Herbivory\nPerhaps the classical example of species interaction is predation: the consumption of prey by its predator. Nature shows on\ntelevision highlight the drama of one living organism killing another. Populations of predators and prey in a community are not\nconstant over time: in most cases, they vary in cycles that appear to be related. The most often cited example of predator-prey\ndynamics is seen in the cycling of the lynx (predator) and the snowshoe hare (prey), using nearly 200 year-old trapping data\nfrom North American forests (Figure 45.18). This cycle of predator and prey lasts approximately 10 years, with the predator\npopulation lagging 1\u20132 years behind that of the prey population. As the hare numbers increase, there is more food available for\nthe lynx, allowing the lynx population to increase as well. When the lynx population grows to a threshold level, however, they kill\nso many hares that hare population begins to decline, followed by a decline in the lynx population because of scarcity of food.\nWhen the lynx population is low, the hare population size begins to increase due, at least in part, to low predation pressure,\nstarting the cycle anew.\n1314\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 45.18 The cycling of lynx and snowshoe hare populations in Northern Ontario is an example of predator-prey dynamics.\nSome researchers question the idea that predation models entirely control the population cycling of the two species. More\nrecent studies have pointed to undefined density-dependent factors as being important in the cycling, in addition to predation.\nOne possibility is that the cycling is inherent in the hare population due to density-dependent effects such as lower fecundity\n(maternal stress) caused by crowding when the hare population gets too dense. The hare cycling would then induce the cycling of\nthe lynx because it is the lynxes\u2019 major food source. The more we study communities, the more complexities we find, allowing\necologists to derive more accurate and sophisticated models of population dynamics.\nHerbivory describes the consumption of plants by insects and other animals, and it is another interspecific relationship that\naffects populations. Unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry animals. Some\nplants have developed mechanisms to defend against herbivory. Other species have developed mutualistic relationships; for\nexample, herbivory provides a mechanism of seed distribution that aids in plant reproduction.\nDefense Mechanisms against Predation and Herbivory\nThe study of communities must consider evolutionary forces that act on the members of the various populations contained\nwithin it. Species are not static, but slowly changing and adapting to their environment by natural selection and other\nevolutionary forces. Species have evolved numerous mechanisms to escape predation and herbivory. These defenses may be\nmechanical, chemical, physical, or behavioral.\nMechanical defenses, such as the presence of thorns on plants or the hard shell on turtles, discourage animal predation and\nherbivory by causing physical pain to the predator or by physically preventing the predator from being able to eat the prey.\nChemical defenses are produced by many animals as well as plants, such as the foxglove which is extremely toxic when eaten.\nFigure 45.19 shows some organisms\u2019 defenses against predation and herbivory.\n45.6 \u2022 Community Ecology\n1315\nFigure 45.19 The (a) honey locust tree (Gleditsia triacanthos) uses thorns, a mechanical defense, against herbivores, while the (b) Florida\nred-bellied turtle (Pseudemys nelsoni) uses its shell as a mechanical defense against predators. (c) Foxglove (Digitalis sp.) uses a chemical\ndefense: toxins produced by the plant can cause nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, convulsions, or death when consumed. (d) The North\nAmerican millipede (Narceus americanus) uses both mechanical and chemical defenses: when threatened, the millipede curls into a\ndefensive ball and produces a noxious substance that irritates eyes and skin.

The tropical walking stick is an insect\nwith the coloration and body shape of a twig which makes it very hard to see when stationary against a background of real twigs\n(Figure 45.20a). In another example, the chameleon can, within limitations, change its color to match its surroundings (Figure\n45.20b). Both of these are examples of camouflage, or avoiding detection by blending in with the background.\nFigure 45.20 (a) The tropical walking stick and (b) the chameleon use body shape and/or coloration to prevent detection by predators.\n(credit a: modification of work by Linda Tanner; credit b: modification of work by Frank Vassen)\nSome species use coloration as a way of warning predators that they are not good to eat. For example, the cinnabar moth\n1316\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncaterpillar, the fire-bellied toad, and many species of beetle have bright colors that warn of a foul taste, the presence of toxic\nchemicals, and/or the ability to sting or bite, respectively. Predators that ignore this coloration and eat the organisms will\nexperience their unpleasant taste or presence of toxic chemicals and learn not to eat them in the future. This type of defensive\nmechanism is called aposematic coloration, or warning coloration (Figure 45.21).\nFigure 45.21 (a) The strawberry poison dart frog (Oophaga pumilio) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators that it is toxic, while the\n(b) striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators of the unpleasant odor it produces. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Jay Iwasaki; credit b: modification of work by Dan Dzurisin)\nWhile some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration, other species have evolved\nmechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten, even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain\ntoxic chemicals. In Batesian mimicry, a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one. Assuming they\nshare the same predators, this coloration then protects the harmless ones, even though they do not have the same level of\nphysical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic. Many insect species mimic the coloration of wasps\nor bees, which are stinging, venomous insects, thereby discouraging predation (Figure 45.22).\nFigure 45.22 Batesian mimicry occurs when a harmless species mimics the coloration of a harmful species, as is seen with the (a)\nbumblebee and (b) bee-like robber fly. (credit a, b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\nIn M\u00fcllerian mimicry, multiple species share the same warning coloration, but all of them actually have defenses. Figure 45.23\nshows a variety of foul-tasting butterflies with similar coloration. In Emsleyan/Mertensian mimicry, a deadly prey mimics a\nless dangerous one, such as the venomous coral snake mimicking the nonvenomous milk snake. This type of mimicry is\nextremely rare and more difficult to understand than the previous two types. For this type of mimicry to work, it is essential that\neating the milk snake has unpleasant but not fatal consequences. Then, these predators learn not to eat snakes with this\ncoloration, protecting the coral snake as well. If the snake were fatal to the predator, there would be no opportunity for the\npredator to learn not to eat it, and the benefit for the less toxic species would disappear.\n45.6 \u2022 Community Ecology\n1317\nFigure 45.23 Several unpleasant-tasting Heliconius butterfly species share a similar color pattern with better-tasting varieties, an example\nof M\u00fcllerian mimicry.

All species have an ecological\nniche in the ecosystem, which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they interact with other species in\nthe community. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot occupy the same niche in a habitat. In other\nwords, different species cannot coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources. An example of this\nprinciple is shown in Figure 45.24, with two protozoan species, Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum. When grown\nindividually in the laboratory, they both thrive. But when they are placed together in the same test tube (habitat), P. aurelia\noutcompetes P. caudatum for food, leading to the latter\u2019s eventual extinction.\n1318\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 45.24 Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum grow well individually, but when they compete for the same resources, the P.\naurelia outcompetes the P. caudatum.\nThis exclusion may be avoided if a population evolves to make use of a different resource, a different area of the habitat, or feeds\nduring a different time of day, called resource partitioning. The two organisms are then said to occupy different microniches.\nThese organisms coexist by minimizing direct competition.\nSymbiosis\nSymbiotic relationships, or symbioses (plural), are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended\nperiod of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations. Most scientists accept this\ndefinition, but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic, where both individuals benefit from the\ninteraction. In this discussion, the broader definition will be used.\nCommensalism\nA commensal relationship occurs when one species benefits from the close, prolonged interaction, while the other neither\nbenefits nor is harmed. Birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship (Figure 45.25). The tree is not\nharmed by the presence of the nest among its branches. The nests are light and produce little strain on the structural integrity of\nthe branch, and most of the leaves, which the tree uses to get energy by photosynthesis, are above the nest so they are\nunaffected. The bird, on the other hand, benefits greatly. If the bird had to nest in the open, its eggs and young would be\nvulnerable to predators. Another example of a commensal relationship is the pilot fish and the shark. The pilot fish feed on the\nleftovers of the host's meals, and the host is not affected in any way.\n45.6 \u2022 Community Ecology\n1319\nFigure 45.25 The southern masked-weaver bird is starting to make a nest in a tree in Zambezi Valley, Zambia. This is an example of a\ncommensal relationship, in which one species (the bird) benefits, while the other (the tree) neither benefits nor is harmed. (credit:\n\u201cHanay\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nMutualism\nA second type of symbiotic relationship is called mutualism, where two species benefit from their interaction. Some scientists\nbelieve that these are the only true examples of symbiosis. For example, termites have a mutualistic relationship with protozoa\nthat live in the insect\u2019s gut (Figure 45.26a). The termite benefits from the ability of bacterial symbionts within the protozoa to\ndigest cellulose. The termite itself cannot do this, and without the protozoa, it would not be able to obtain energy from its food\n(cellulose from the wood it chews and eats). The protozoa and the bacterial symbionts benefit by having a protective\nenvironment and a constant supply of food from the wood chewing actions of the termite. Lichens have a mutualistic\nrelationship between fungus and photosynthetic algae or bacteria (Figure 45.26b). As these symbionts grow together, the glucose\nproduced by the algae provides nourishment for both organisms, whereas the physical structure of the lichen protects the algae\nfrom the elements and makes certain nutrients in the atmosphere more available to the algae.\nFigure 45.26 (a) Termites form a mutualistic relationship with symbiotic protozoa in their guts, which allow both organisms to obtain energy\nfrom the cellulose the termite consumes. (b) Lichen is a fungus that has symbiotic photosynthetic algae living inside its cells. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Scott Bauer, USDA; credit b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)\nParasitism\nA parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it. In this relationship, the\nparasite benefits, but the host is harmed. The host is usually weakened by the parasite as it siphons resources the host would\nnormally use to maintain itself. The parasite, however, is unlikely to kill the host, especially not quickly, because this would allow\nno time for the organism to complete its reproductive cycle by spreading to another host.\nThe reproductive cycles of parasites are often very complex, sometimes requiring more than one host species. A tapeworm is a\n1320\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nparasite that causes disease in humans when contaminated, undercooked meat is consumed (Figure 45.27). The tapeworm can\nlive inside the intestine of the host for several years, benefiting from the food the host is eating, and may grow to be over 50 ft\nlong by adding segments. The parasite moves from species to species in a cycle, making two hosts necessary to complete its life\ncycle.\nAnother common parasite is Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan cause of malaria, a significant disease in many parts of the\nworld. Living in human liver and red blood cells, the organism reproduces asexually in the gut of blood-feeding mosquitoes to\ncomplete its life cycle. Thus malaria is spread from human to human by mosquitoes, one of many arthropod-borne infectious\ndiseases.\nFigure 45.27 This diagram shows the life cycle of a pork tapeworm (Taenia solium), a human worm parasite. (credit: modification of work\nby CDC)\nCharacteristics of Communities\nCommunities are complex entities that can be characterized by their structure (the types and numbers of species present) and\ndynamics (how communities change over time). Understanding community structure and dynamics enables community\necologists to manage ecosystems more effectively.\nFoundation Species\nFoundation species are considered the \u201cbase\u201d or \u201cbedrock\u201d of a community, having the greatest influence on its overall structure.\nThey are usually the primary producers: organisms that bring most of the energy into the community. Kelp, or brown algae, is a\nfoundation species, forming the basis of the kelp forests off the coast of California.\nFoundation species may physically modify the environment to produce and maintain habitats that benefit the other organisms\nthat use them. An example is the photosynthetic corals of the coral reef (Figure 45.28). Corals themselves are not photosynthetic,\nbut harbor symbionts within their body tissues (dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae) that perform photosynthesis; this is\nanother example of a mutualism. The exoskeletons of living and dead coral make up most of the reef structure, which protects\nmany other species from waves and ocean currents.\n45.6 \u2022 Community Ecology\n1321\nFigure 45.28 Coral is the foundation species of coral reef ecosystems. (credit: Jim E. Maragos, USFWS)\nBiodiversity, Species Richness, and Relative Species Abundance\nBiodiversity describes a community\u2019s biological complexity: it is measured by the number of different species (species richness)\nin a particular area and their relative abundance (species evenness). The area in question could be a habitat, a biome, or the\nentire biosphere. Species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat or biome. Species\nrichness varies across the globe (Figure 45.29). One factor in determining species richness is latitude, with the greatest species\nrichness occurring in ecosystems near the equator, which often have warmer temperatures, large amounts of rainfall, and low\nseasonality. The lowest species richness occurs near the poles, which are much colder, drier, and thus less conducive to life in\nGeologic time (time since glaciations). The predictability of climate or productivity is also an important factor. Other factors\ninfluence species richness as well. For example, the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species\nrichness found in certain isolated island chains, including the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands that inspired the young Darwin. Relative\nspecies abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a\nhabitat, ecosystem, or biome. Foundation species often have the highest relative abundance of species.\nFigure 45.29 The greatest species richness for mammals in North and South America is associated with the equatorial latitudes.

The intertidal sea star, Pisaster ochraceus, of the northwestern United States is a keystone species\n(Figure 45.30). Studies have shown that when this organism is removed from communities, populations of their natural prey\n(mussels) increase, completely altering the species composition and reducing biodiversity. Another keystone species is the\nbanded tetra, a fish in tropical streams, which supplies nearly all of the phosphorus, a necessary inorganic nutrient, to the rest\n1322\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nof the community. If these fish were to become extinct, the community would be greatly affected.\nFigure 45.30 The Pisaster ochraceus sea star is a keystone species. (credit: Jerry Kirkhart)\nEveryday Connection\nInvasive Species\nInvasive species are nonnative organisms that, when introduced to an area out of their native range, threaten the ecosystem\nbalance of that habitat. Many such species exist in the United States, as shown in Figure 45.31. Whether enjoying a forest\nhike, taking a summer boat trip, or simply walking down an urban street, you have likely encountered an invasive species.\nFigure 45.31 In the United States, invasive species like (a) purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and the (b) zebra mussel (Dreissena\npolymorpha) threaten certain aquatic ecosystems. Some forests are threatened by the spread of (c) common buckthorn (Rhamnus\ncathartica), (d) garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), and (e) the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis). The (f) European starling\n(Sturnus vulgaris) may compete with native bird species for nest holes. (credit a: modification of work by Liz West; credit b:\nmodification of work by M. McCormick, NOAA; credit c: modification of work by E. Dronkert; credit d: modification of work by Dan\nDavison; credit e: modification of work by USDA; credit f: modification of work by Don DeBold)\nOne of the many recent proliferations of an invasive species concerns the growth of Asian carp populations. Asian carp were\nintroduced to the United States in the 1970s by fisheries and sewage treatment facilities that used the fish\u2019s excellent filter\nfeeding capabilities to clean their ponds of excess plankton. Some of the fish escaped, however, and by the 1980s they had\ncolonized many waterways of the Mississippi River basin, including the Illinois and Missouri Rivers.\n45.6 \u2022 Community Ecology\n1323\nCommunity Dynamics\nCommunity dynamics are the changes in community structure and composition over time. Sometimes these changes are\ninduced by environmental disturbances such as volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, fires, and climate change. Communities with a\nstable structure are said to be at equilibrium. Following a disturbance, the community may or may not return to the equilibrium\nstate.\nSuccession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time. In primary succession,\nnewly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things; in secondary succession, part of an ecosystem is disturbed\nand remnants of the previous community remain.\nPrimary Succession and Pioneer Species\nPrimary succession occurs when new land is formed or rock is exposed: for example, following the eruption of volcanoes, such\nas those on the Big Island of Hawaii. As lava flows into the ocean, new land is continually being formed. On the Big Island,\napproximately 32 acres of land is added each year. First, weathering and other natural forces break down the substrate enough\nfor the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with few soil requirements, known as pioneer species (Figure 45.32).\nThese species help to further break down the mineral rich lava into soil where other, less hardy species will grow and eventually\nreplace the pioneer species. In addition, as these early species grow and die, they add to an ever-growing layer of decomposing\norganic material and contribute to soil formation. Over time the area will reach an equilibrium state, with a set of organisms\nquite different from the pioneer species.\nVoracious eaters and rapid reproducers, Asian carp may outcompete native species for food, potentially leading to their\nextinction. For example, black carp are voracious eaters of native mussels and snails, limiting this food source for native fish\nspecies. Silver carp eat plankton that native mussels and snails feed on, reducing this food source by a different alteration of\nthe food web. In some areas of the Mississippi River, Asian carp species have become the most predominant, effectively\noutcompeting native fishes for habitat. In some parts of the Illinois River, Asian carp constitute 95 percent of the\ncommunity's biomass. Although edible, the fish is bony and not a desired food in the United States. Moreover, their\npresence threatens the native fish and fisheries of the Great Lakes, which are important to local economies and recreational\nanglers. Asian carp have even injured humans. The fish, frightened by the sound of approaching motorboats, thrust\nthemselves into the air, often landing in the boat or directly hitting the boaters.\nThe Great Lakes and their prized salmon and lake trout fisheries are also being threatened by these invasive fish. Asian carp\nhave already colonized rivers and canals that lead into Lake Michigan. One infested waterway of particular importance is\nthe Chicago Sanitary and Ship Channel, the major supply waterway linking the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River. To\nprevent the Asian carp from leaving the canal, a series of electric barriers have been successfully used to discourage their\nmigration; however, the threat is significant enough that several states and Canada have sued to have the Chicago channel\npermanently cut off from Lake Michigan. Local and national politicians have weighed in on how to solve the problem, but no\none knows whether the Asian carp will ultimately be considered a nuisance, like other invasive species such as the water\nhyacinth and zebra mussel, or whether it will be the destroyer of the largest freshwater fishery of the world.\nThe issues associated with Asian carp show how population and community ecology, fisheries management, and politics\nintersect on issues of vital importance to the human food supply and economy. Socio-political issues like this make\nextensive use of the sciences of population ecology (the study of members of a particular species occupying a particular area\nknown as a habitat) and community ecology (the study of the interaction of all species within a habitat).\n1324\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 45.32 During primary succession in lava on Maui, Hawaii, succulent plants are the pioneer species. (credit: Forest and Kim Starr)\nSecondary succession\nA classic example of secondary succession occurs in oak and hickory forests cleared by wildfire (Figure 45.33). Wildfires will burn\nmost vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area. Their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground in the form\nof ash. Thus, even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires, the area will soon be ready for new life to take hold.\nBefore the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight. Their height\ngave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species. After the fire, though, these trees are no\nlonger dominant. Thus, the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years by quickly growing\nand spreading grasses and other pioneer species. Due to, at least in part, changes in the environment brought on by the growth\nof the grasses and other species, over many years, shrubs will emerge along with small pine, oak, and hickory trees. These\norganisms are called intermediate species. Eventually, over 150 years, the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species\ncomposition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire. This equilibrium state is referred to as the\nclimax community, which will remain stable until the next disturbance.\nFigure 45.33 Secondary succession is shown in an oak and hickory forest after a forest fire.\n45.7 Behavioral Biology: Proximate and Ultimate Causes of\nBehavior\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nCompare innate and learned behavior\n\u2022\nDiscuss how movement and migration behaviors are a result of natural selection\n\u2022\nDiscuss the different ways members of a population communicate with each other\n\u2022\nGive examples of how species use energy for mating displays and other courtship behaviors\n\u2022\nDifferentiate between various mating systems\n\u2022\nDescribe different ways that species learn\nBehavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus. Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and\nevolutionary bases for such changes. The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new.\n45.7 \u2022 Behavioral Biology: Proximate and Ultimate Causes of Behavior\n1325\nFor decades, several types of scientists have studied animal behavior. Biologists do so in the science of ethology; psychologists in\nthe science of comparative psychology; and other scientists in the science of neurobiology. The first two, ethology and\ncomparative psychology, are the most consequential for the study of behavioral biology.\nOne goal of behavioral biology is to distinguish between the innate behaviors, which have a strong genetic component and are\nlargely independent of environmental influences, from the learned behaviors, which result from environmental conditioning.\nInnate behavior, or instinct, is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned. They are \u201chard wired\u201d\ninto the system. On the other hand, learned behaviors, although riskier, are flexible, dynamic, and can be altered according to\nchanges in the environment.\nInnate Behaviors: Movement and Migration\nInnate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli. The simplest example of this is a reflex action, an involuntary and\nrapid response to stimulus. To test the \u201cknee-jerk\u201d reflex, a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a rubber\nhammer. The stimulation of the nerves leads to the reflex of extending the leg at the knee. This is similar to the reaction of\nsomeone who touches a hot stove and instinctually pulls his or her hand away. Even humans, with our great capacity to learn,\nstill exhibit a variety of innate behaviors.\nKinesis and Taxis\nAnother activity or movement of innate behavior is kinesis, or the undirected movement in response to a stimulus. Orthokinesis\nis the increased or decreased speed of movement of an organism in response to a stimulus. Woodlice, for example, increase\ntheir speed of movement when exposed to high or low temperatures. This movement, although random, increases the\nprobability that the insect spends less time in the unfavorable environment. Another example is klinokinesis, an increase in\nturning behaviors. It is exhibited by bacteria such as E. coli which, in association with orthokinesis, helps the organisms\nrandomly find a more hospitable environment.\nA similar, but more directed version of kinesis is taxis: the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus. This movement\ncan be in response to light (phototaxis), chemical signals (chemotaxis), or gravity (geotaxis) and can be directed toward (positive)\nor away (negative) from the source of the stimulus. An example of a positive chemotaxis is exhibited by the unicellular protozoan\nTetrahymena thermophila. This organism swims using its cilia, at times moving in a straight line, and at other times making\nturns. The attracting chemotactic agent alters the frequency of turning as the organism moves directly toward the source,\nfollowing the increasing concentration gradient.\nFixed Action Patterns\nA fixed action pattern is a series of movements elicited by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus is removed, the pattern\ngoes on to completion. An example of such a behavior occurs in the three-spined stickleback, a small freshwater fish (Figure\n45.34). Males of this species develop a red belly during breeding season and show instinctual aggressiveness to other males\nduring this time. In laboratory experiments, researchers exposed such fish to objects that in no way resemble a fish in their\nshape, but which were painted red on their lower halves. The male sticklebacks responded aggressively to the objects just as if\nthey were real male sticklebacks.\nFigure 45.34 Male three-spined stickleback fish exhibit a fixed action pattern. During mating season, the males, which develop a bright red\nbelly, react strongly to red-bottomed objects that in no way resemble fish.\nMigration\nMigration is the long-range seasonal movement of animals. It is an evolved, adapted response to variation in resource\n1326\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\navailability, and it is a common phenomenon found in all major groups of animals. Birds fly south for the winter to get to\nwarmer climates with sufficient food, and salmon migrate to their spawning grounds. The popular 2005 documentary March of\nthe Penguins followed the 62-mile migration of emperor penguins through Antarctica to bring food back to their breeding site\nand to their young. Wildebeests (Figure 45.35) migrate over 1800 miles each year in search of new grasslands.\nFigure 45.35 Wildebeests migrate in a clockwise fashion over 1800 miles each year in search of rain-ripened grass. (credit: Eric Inafuku)\nAlthough migration is thought of as innate behavior, only some migrating species always migrate (obligate migration). Animals\nthat exhibit facultative migration can choose to migrate or not. Additionally, in some animals, only a portion of the population\nmigrates, whereas the rest does not migrate (incomplete migration). For example, owls that live in the tundra may migrate in\nyears when their food source, small rodents, is relatively scarce, but not migrate during the years when rodents are plentiful.\nForaging\nForaging is the act of searching for and exploiting food resources. Feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and minimize\nenergy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors, and these are favored by natural section. The painted stork, for\nexample, uses its long beak to search the bottom of a freshwater marshland for crabs and other food (Figure 45.36).\nFigure 45.36 The painted stork uses its long beak to forage. (credit: J.M. Garg)\nInnate Behaviors: Living in Groups\nNot all animals live in groups, but even those that live relatively solitary lives, with the exception of those that can reproduce\nasexually, must mate. Mating usually involves one animal signaling another so as to communicate the desire to mate. There are\nseveral types of energy-intensive behaviors or displays associated with mating, called mating rituals. Other behaviors found in\npopulations that live in groups are described in terms of which animal benefits from the behavior. In selfish behavior, only the\nanimal in question benefits; in altruistic behavior, one animal\u2019s actions benefit another animal; cooperative behavior describes\nwhen both animals benefit. All of these behaviors involve some sort of communication between population members.\nCommunication within a Species\nAnimals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals. An example of this is seen in the three-spined\nstickleback, where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals\nfemales to mate. Other signals are chemical (pheromones), aural (sound), visual (courtship and aggressive displays), or tactile\n(touch). These types of communication may be instinctual or learned or a combination of both. These are not the same as the\n45.7 \u2022 Behavioral Biology: Proximate and Ultimate Causes of Behavior\n1327\ncommunication we associate with language, which has been observed only in humans and perhaps in some species of primates\nand cetaceans.\nA pheromone is a secreted chemical signal used to obtain a response from another individual of the same species. The purpose\nof pheromones is to elicit a specific behavior from the receiving individual. Pheromones are especially common among social\ninsects, but they are used by many species to attract the opposite sex, to sound alarms, to mark food trails, and to elicit other,\nmore complex behaviors. Even humans are thought to respond to certain pheromones called axillary steroids. These chemicals\ninfluence human perception of other people, and in one study were responsible for a group of women synchronizing their\nmenstrual cycles. The role of pheromones in human-to-human communication is not fully understood and continues to be\nresearched.\nSongs are an example of an aural signal, one that needs to be heard by the recipient. Perhaps the best known of these are songs\nof birds, which identify the species and are used to attract mates. Other well-known songs are those of whales, which are of such\nlow frequency that they can travel long distances underwater. Dolphin species communicate with each other (and occasionally\neven with other species of dolphins) using a wide variety of vocalizations. Male crickets make chirping sounds using a\nspecialized organ to attract a mate, repel other males, and to announce a successful mating.\nCourtship displays are a series of ritualized visual behaviors (signals) designed to attract and convince a member of the opposite\nsex to mate. These displays are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. Often these displays involve a series of steps, including an\ninitial display by one member followed by a response from the other. If at any point, the display is performed incorrectly or a\nproper response is not given, the mating ritual is abandoned and the mating attempt will be unsuccessful. The mating display of\nthe common stork is shown in Figure 45.37.\nAggressive displays are also common in the animal kingdom. For example, a dog bares its teeth when it wants another dog to\nback down. Presumably, these displays communicate not only the willingness of the animal to fight, but also its fighting ability.\nAlthough these displays do signal aggression on the part of the sender, it is thought that these displays are actually a mechanism\nto reduce the amount of actual fighting that occurs between members of the same species: they allow individuals to assess the\nfighting ability of their opponent and thus decide whether it is \u201cworth the fight.\u201d The testing of certain hypotheses using game\ntheory has led to the conclusion that some of these displays may overstate an animal\u2019s actual fighting ability and are used to\n\u201cbluff\u201d the opponent. This type of interaction, even if \u201cdishonest,\u201d would be favored by natural selection if it is successful more\ntimes than not.\nFigure 45.37 This stork\u2019s courtship display is designed to attract potential mates. (credit: Linda \u201cjinterwas\u201d/Flickr)\nDistraction displays are seen in birds and some fish. They are designed to attract a predator away from the nest. This is an\nexample of an altruistic behavior: it benefits the young more than the individual performing the display, which is putting itself\nat risk by doing so.\nMany animals, especially primates, communicate with other members in the group through touch. Activities such as grooming,\ntouching the shoulder or root of the tail, embracing, lip contact, and greeting ceremonies have all been observed in the Indian\nlangur, an Old World monkey. Similar behaviors are found in other primates, especially in the great apes.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe killdeer bird distracts predators from its eggs by faking a broken wing display in this video taken in Boise, Idaho.\n1328\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/killdeer_bird)\nAltruistic Behaviors\nBehaviors that lower the fitness of the individual but increase the fitness of another individual are termed altruistic. Examples\nof such behaviors are seen widely across the animal kingdom. Social insects such as worker bees have no ability to reproduce, yet\nthey maintain the queen so she can populate the hive with her offspring. Meerkats keep a sentry standing guard to warn the rest\nof the colony about intruders, even though the sentry is putting itself at risk. Wolves and wild dogs bring meat to pack members\nnot present during a hunt. Lemurs take care of infants unrelated to them. Although on the surface, these behaviors appear to be\naltruistic, the truth may not be so simple.\nThere has been much discussion over why altruistic behaviors exist. Do these behaviors lead to overall evolutionary advantages\nfor their species? Do they help the altruistic individual pass on its own genes? And what about such activities between unrelated\nindividuals? One explanation for altruistic-type behaviors is found in the genetics of natural selection. In the 1976 book, The\nSelfish Gene, scientist Richard Dawkins attempted to explain many seemingly altruistic behaviors from the viewpoint of the\ngene itself. Although a gene obviously cannot be selfish in the human sense, it may appear that way if the sacrifice of an\nindividual benefits related individuals that share genes that are identical by descent (present in relatives because of common\nlineage). Mammal parents make this sacrifice to take care of their offspring. Emperor penguins migrate miles in harsh\nconditions to bring food back for their young. Selfish gene theory has been controversial over the years and is still discussed\namong scientists in related fields.\nEven less-related individuals, those with less genetic identity than that shared by parent and offspring, benefit from seemingly\naltruistic behavior. The activities of social insects such as bees, wasps, ants, and termites are good examples. Sterile workers in\nthese societies take care of the queen because they are closely related to it, and as the queen has offspring, she is passing on\ngenes from the workers indirectly. Thus, it is of fitness benefit for the worker to maintain the queen without having any direct\nchance of passing on its genes due to its sterility. The lowering of individual fitness to enhance the reproductive fitness of a\nrelative and thus one\u2019s inclusive fitness evolves through kin selection. This phenomenon can explain many superficially altruistic\nbehaviors seen in animals. However, these behaviors may not be truly defined as altruism in these cases because the actor is\nactually increasing its own fitness either directly (through its own offspring) or indirectly (through the inclusive fitness it gains\nthrough relatives that share genes with it).\nUnrelated individuals may also act altruistically to each other, and this seems to defy the \u201cselfish gene\u201d explanation. An example\nof this observed in many monkey species where a monkey will present its back to an unrelated monkey to have that individual\npick the parasites from its fur. After a certain amount of time, the roles are reversed and the first monkey now grooms the\nsecond monkey. Thus, there is reciprocity in the behavior. Both benefit from the interaction and their fitness is raised more than\nif neither cooperated nor if one cooperated and the other did not cooperate. This behavior is still not necessarily altruism, as the\n\u201cgiving\u201d behavior of the actor is based on the expectation that it will be the \u201creceiver\u201d of the behavior in the future, termed\nreciprocal altruism. Reciprocal altruism requires that individuals repeatedly encounter each other, often the result of living in\nthe same social group, and that cheaters (those that never \u201cgive back\u201d) are punished.\nEvolutionary game theory, a modification of classical game theory in mathematics, has shown that many of these so-called\n\u201caltruistic behaviors\u201d are not altruistic at all. The definition of \u201cpure\u201d altruism, based on human behavior, is an action that\nbenefits another without any direct benefit to oneself. Most of the behaviors previously described do not seem to satisfy this\ndefinition, and game theorists are good at finding \u201cselfish\u201d components in them. Others have argued that the terms \u201cselfish\u201d and\n\u201caltruistic\u201d should be dropped completely when discussing animal behavior, as they describe human behavior and may not be\ndirectly applicable to instinctual animal activity. What is clear, though, is that heritable behaviors that improve the chances of\npassing on one\u2019s genes or a portion of one\u2019s genes are favored by natural selection and will be retained in future generations as\nlong as those behaviors convey a fitness advantage. These instinctual behaviors may then be applied, in special circumstances, to\nother species, as long as it doesn\u2019t lower the animal\u2019s fitness.\nFinding Sex Partners\nNot all animals reproduce sexually, but many that do have the same challenge: they need to find a suitable mate and often have\nto compete with other individuals to obtain one. Significant energy is spent in the process of locating, attracting, and mating\nwith the sex partner. Two types of selection occur during this process: intersexual selection, where individuals of one sex choose\nmates of the other sex, and intrasexual selection, the competition for mates between species members of the same sex.\nIntersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual, aural, tactile, and chemical\n45.7 \u2022 Behavioral Biology: Proximate and Ultimate Causes of Behavior\n1329\ncues. An example of intersexual selection is when female peacocks choose to mate with the male with the brightest plumage.\nThis type of selection often leads to traits in the chosen sex that do not enhance survival, but are those traits most attractive to\nthe opposite sex (often at the expense of survival). Intrasexual selection involves mating displays and aggressive mating rituals\nsuch as rams butting heads\u2014the winner of these battles is the one that is able to mate. Many of these rituals use up considerable\nenergy but result in the selection of the healthiest, strongest, and/or most dominant individuals for mating.\nThree general mating systems, all involving innate as opposed to learned behaviors, are seen in animal populations:\nmonogamous, polygynous, and polyandrous.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/sex_selection) for informative videos on sexual selection.\nIn monogamous systems, one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season. In some animals, such as the\ngray wolf, these associations can last much longer, even a lifetime. Several theories may explain this type of mating system. The\n\u201cmate-guarding hypothesis\u201d states that males stay with the female to prevent other males from mating with her. This behavior is\nadvantageous in such situations where mates are scarce and difficult to find. Another explanation is the \u201cmale-assistance\nhypothesis,\u201d where males that help guard and rear their young will have more and healthier offspring. Monogamy is observed in\nmany bird populations where, in addition to the parental care from the female, the male is also a major provider of parental care\nfor the chicks. A third explanation for the evolutionary advantages of monogamy is the \u201cfemale-enforcement hypothesis.\u201d In this\nscenario, the female ensures that the male does not have other offspring that might compete with her own, so she actively\ninterferes with the male\u2019s signaling to attract other mates.\nPolygynous mating refers to one male mating with multiple females. In these situations, the female must be responsible for\nmost of the parental care as the single male is not capable of providing care to that many offspring. In resourced-based\npolygyny, males compete for territories with the best resources, and then mate with females that enter the territory, drawn to its\nresource richness. The female benefits by mating with a dominant, genetically fit male; however, it is at the cost of having no\nmale help in caring for the offspring. An example is seen in the yellow-rumped honeyguide, a bird whose males defend beehives\nbecause the females feed on their wax. As the females approach, the male defending the nest will mate with them. Harem\nmating structures are a type of polygynous system where certain males dominate mating while controlling a territory with\nresources. Harem mating occurs in elephant seals, where the alpha male dominates the mating within the group. A third type of\npolygyny is a lek system. Here there is a communal courting area where several males perform elaborate displays for females,\nand the females choose their mate from this group. This behavior is observed in several bird species including the sage grouse\nand the prairie chicken.\nIn polyandrous mating systems, one female mates with many males. These types of systems are much rarer than monogamous\nand polygynous mating systems. In pipefishes and seahorses, males receive the eggs from the female, fertilize them, protect\nthem within a pouch, and give birth to the offspring (Figure 45.38). Therefore, the female is able to provide eggs to several males\nwithout the burden of carrying the fertilized eggs.\nFigure 45.38 Polyandrous mating, in which one female mates with many males, occurs in the (a) seahorse and the (b) pipefish.

They are inherited and the behaviors do not change in response to signals from the environment.\nConversely, learned behaviors, even though they may have instinctive components, allow an organism to adapt to changes in the\nenvironment and are modified by previous experiences. Simple learned behaviors include habituation and imprinting\u2014both are\nimportant to the maturation process of young animals.\nHabituation\nHabituation is a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of repeated exposure.\nThis is a form of non-associative learning, as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward. Prairie dogs\ntypically sound an alarm call when threatened by a predator, but they become habituated to the sound of human footsteps when\nno harm is associated with this sound, therefore, they no longer respond to them with an alarm call. In this example,\nhabituation is specific to the sound of human footsteps, as the animals still respond to the sounds of potential predators.\nImprinting\nImprinting is a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the species\ninvolved. Hatchling ducks recognize the first adult they see, their mother, and make a bond with her. A familiar sight is\nducklings walking or swimming after their mothers (Figure 45.39). This is another type of non-associative learning, but is very\nimportant in the maturation process of these animals as it encourages them to stay near their mother so they will be protected,\ngreatly increasing their chances of survival. However, if newborn ducks see a human before they see their mother, they will\nimprint on the human and follow it in just the same manner as they would follow their real mother.\nFigure 45.39 The attachment of ducklings to their mother is an example of imprinting. (credit: modification of work by Mark Harkin)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe International Crane Foundation has helped raise the world\u2019s population of whooping cranes from 21 individuals to about\n600. Imprinting hatchlings has been a key to success: biologists wear full crane costumes so the birds never \u201csee\u201d humans.\nWatch this video to learn more.\nClick to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/whooping_crane)\nConditioned Behavior\nConditioned behaviors are types of associative learning, where a stimulus becomes associated with a consequence. During\noperant conditioning, the behavioral response is modified by its consequences, with regards to its form, strength, or frequency.\nClassical Conditioning\nIn classical conditioning, a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously not\nbeen associated with, the conditioned stimulus. The response to the original, unconditioned stimulus is called the\nunconditioned response. The most cited example of classical conditioning is Ivan Pavlov\u2019s experiments with dogs (Figure 45.40).\nIn Pavlov\u2019s experiments, the unconditioned response was the salivation of dogs in response to the unconditioned stimulus of\nseeing or smelling their food. The conditioning stimulus that researchers associated with the unconditioned response was the\nringing of a bell. During conditioning, every time the animal was given food, the bell was rung. This was repeated during several\ntrials. After some time, the dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with food and to respond by salivating. After the\n45.7 \u2022 Behavioral Biology: Proximate and Ultimate Causes of Behavior\n1331\nconditioning period was finished, the dog would respond by salivating when the bell was rung, even when the unconditioned\nstimulus, the food, was absent. Thus, the ringing of the bell became the conditioned stimulus and the salivation became the\nconditioned response. Although it is thought by some scientists that the unconditioned and conditioned responses are identical,\neven Pavlov discovered that the saliva in the conditioned dogs had characteristic differences when compared to the\nunconditioned dog.\nFigure 45.40 In the classic Pavlovian response, the dog becomes conditioned to associate the ringing of the bell with food.\nIt had been thought by some scientists that this type of conditioning required multiple exposures to the paired stimulus and\nresponse, but it is now known that this is not necessary in all cases, and that some conditioning can be learned in a single\npairing experiment. Classical conditioning is a major tenet of behaviorism, a branch of psychological philosophy that proposes\nthat all actions, thoughts, and emotions of living things are behaviors that can be treated by behavior modification and changes\nin the environment.\nOperant Conditioning\nIn operant conditioning, the conditioned behavior is gradually modified by its consequences as the animal responds to the\nstimulus. A major proponent of such conditioning was psychologist B.F. Skinner, the inventor of the Skinner box. Skinner put\nrats in his boxes that contained a lever that would dispense food to the rat when depressed. While initially the rat would push\nthe lever a few times by accident, it eventually associated pushing the lever with getting the food. This type of learning is an\nexample of operant conditioning. Operant learning is the basis of most animal training. The conditioned behavior is continually\nmodified by positive or negative reinforcement, often a reward such as food or some type of punishment, respectively. In this\nway, the animal is conditioned to associate a type of behavior with the punishment or reward, and, over time, can be induced to\nperform behaviors that they would not have done in the wild, such as the \u201ctricks\u201d dolphins perform at marine amusement park\nshows (Figure 45.41).\nFigure 45.41 The training of dolphins by rewarding them with food is an example of positive reinforcement operant conditioning. (credit:\nRoland Tanglao)\nCognitive Learning\nClassical and operant conditioning are inefficient ways for humans and other intelligent animals to learn. Some primates,\nincluding humans, are able to learn by imitating the behavior of others and by taking instructions. The development of complex\nlanguage by humans has made cognitive learning, the manipulation of information using the mind, the most prominent\n1332\nChapter 45 \u2022 Population and Community Ecology\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nmethod of human learning. In fact, that is how students are learning right now by reading this book. As students read, they can\nmake mental images of objects or organisms and imagine changes to them, or behaviors by them, and anticipate the\nconsequences. In addition to visual processing, cognitive learning is also enhanced by remembering past experiences, touching\nphysical objects, hearing sounds, tasting food, and a variety of other sensory-based inputs. Cognitive learning is so powerful\nthat it can be used to understand conditioning in detail. In the reverse scenario, conditioning cannot help someone learn about\ncognition.\nClassic work on cognitive learning was done by Wolfgang K\u00f6hler with chimpanzees. He demonstrated that these animals were\ncapable of abstract thought by showing that they could learn how to solve a puzzle. When a banana was hung in their cage too\nhigh for them to reach, and several boxes were placed randomly on the floor, some of the chimps were able to stack the boxes\none on top of the other, climb on top of them, and get the banana. This implies that they could visualize the result of stacking the\nboxes even before they had performed the action. This type of learning is much more powerful and versatile than conditioning.\nCognitive learning is not limited to primates, although they are the most efficient in using it. Maze running experiments done\nwith rats by H.C. Blodgett in the 1920s were the first to show cognitive skills in a simple mammal. The motivation for the\nanimals to work their way through the maze was a piece of food at its end. In these studies, the animals in Group I were run in\none trial per day and had food available to them each day on completion of the run (Figure 45.42). Group II rats were not fed in\nthe maze for the first six days and then subsequent runs were done with food for several days after. Group III rats had food\navailable on the third day and every day thereafter. The results were that the control rats, Group I, learned quickly, and figured\nout how to run the maze in seven days. Group III did not learn much during the three days without food, but rapidly caught up\nto the control group when given the food reward. Group II learned very slowly for the six days with no reward to motivate them,\nand they did not begin to catch up to the control group until the day food was given, and then it took two days longer to learn the\nmaze.\nFigure 45.42 Group I (the green solid line) found food at the end of each trial, group II (the blue dashed line) did not find food for the first 6\ndays, and group III (the red dotted line) did not find food during runs on the first three days. Notice that rats given food earlier learned\nfaster and eventually caught up to the control group. The orange dots on the group II and III lines show the days when food rewards were\nadded to the mazes.\nIt may not be immediately obvious that this type of learning is different than conditioning. Although one might be tempted to\nbelieve that the rats simply learned how to find their way through a conditioned series of right and left turns, E.C. Tolman\nproved a decade later that the rats were making a representation of the maze in their minds, which he called a \u201ccognitive map.\u201d\nThis was an early demonstration of the power of cognitive learning and how these abilities were not just limited to humans.\nSociobiology\nSociobiology is an interdisciplinary science originally popularized by social insect researcher E.O. Wilson in the 1970s. Wilson\n45.7 \u2022 Behavioral Biology: Proximate and Ultimate Causes of Behavior\n1333\ndefined the science as \u201cthe extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization.\u201d9The main thrust of\nsociobiology is that animal and human behavior, including aggressiveness and other social interactions, can be explained almost\nsolely in terms of genetics and natural selection. This science is controversial; noted scientists such as the late Stephen Jay Gould\ncriticized the approach for ignoring the environmental effects on behavior. This is another example of the \u201cnature versus\nnurture\u201d debate of the role of genetics versus the role of environment in determining an organism\u2019s characteristics.\nSociobiology also links genes with behaviors and has been associated with \u201cbiological determinism,\u201d the belief that all behaviors\nare hardwired into our genes. No one disputes that certain behaviors can be inherited and that natural selection plays a role\nretaining them. It is the application of such principles to human behavior that sparks this controversy, which remains active\ntoday.\n9Edward O. Wilson.

a species that live in a\nparticular habitat. Ecologists measure characteristics of\npopulations: size, density, dispersion pattern, age structure,\nand sex ratio. Life tables are useful to calculate life\nexpectancies of individual population members.\nSurvivorship curves show the number of individuals\nsurviving at each age interval plotted versus time.\n45.2 Life Histories and Natural\nSelection\nAll species have evolved a pattern of living, called a life\nhistory strategy, in which they partition energy for growth,\nmaintenance, and reproduction. These patterns evolve\nthrough natural selection; they allow species to adapt to their\nenvironment to obtain the resources they need to\nsuccessfully reproduce. There is an inverse relationship\nbetween fecundity and parental care. A species may\nreproduce early in life to ensure surviving to a reproductive\nage or reproduce later in life to become larger and healthier\n1336\nChapter 45 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nand better able to give parental care. A species may\nreproduce once (semelparity) or many times (iteroparity) in\nits life.\n45.3 Environmental Limits to\nPopulation Growth\nPopulations with unlimited resources grow exponentially,\nwith an accelerating growth rate. When resources become\nlimiting, populations follow a logistic growth curve. The\npopulation of a species will level off at the carrying capacity\nof its environment.\n45.4 Population Dynamics and\nRegulation\nPopulations are regulated by a variety of density-dependent\nand density-independent factors. Species are divided into\ntwo categories based on a variety of features of their life\nhistory patterns: r-selected species, which have large\nnumbers of offspring, and K-selected species, which have\nfew offspring. The r- and K-selection theory has fallen out of\nuse; however, many of its key features are still used in newer,\ndemographically-based models of population dynamics.\n45.5 Human Population Growth\nThe world\u2019s human population is growing at an exponential\nrate. Humans have increased the world\u2019s carrying capacity\nthrough migration, agriculture, medical advances, and\ncommunication. The age structure of a population allows us\nto predict population growth. Unchecked human population\ngrowth could have dire long-term effects on our\nenvironment.\n45.6 Community Ecology\nCommunities include all the different species living in a\ngiven area. The variety of these species is called species\nrichness. Many organisms have developed defenses against\npredation and herbivory, including mechanical defenses,\nwarning coloration, and mimicry, as a result of evolution and\nthe interaction with other members of the community. Two\nspecies cannot exist in the same habitat competing directly\nfor the same resources. Species may form symbiotic\nrelationships such as commensalism or mutualism.\nCommunity structure is described by its foundation and\nkeystone species. Communities respond to environmental\ndisturbances by succession (the predictable appearance of\ndifferent types of plant species) until a stable community\nstructure is established.\n45.7 Behavioral Biology: Proximate\nand Ultimate Causes of Behavior\nBehaviors are responses to stimuli. They can either be\ninstinctual/innate behaviors, which are not influenced by the\nenvironment, or learned behaviors, which are influenced by\nenvironmental changes. Instinctual behaviors include\nmating systems and methods of communication. Learned\nbehaviors include imprinting and habituation, conditioning,\nand, most powerfully, cognitive learning.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.

(credit \"highway\":\nmodification of work by Phillip Capper; credit \"mouse\": modification of work by USFWS)\nINTRODUCTION In 1993, an interesting example of ecosystem dynamics occurred when a rare lung\ndisease struck inhabitants of the southwestern United States. This disease had an alarming rate of\nfatalities, killing more than half of early patients, many of whom were Native Americans. These formerly\nhealthy young adults died from complete respiratory failure. The disease was unknown, and the Centers\nfor Disease Control (CDC), the United States government agency responsible for managing potential\nepidemics, was brought in to investigate. The scientists could have learned about the disease had they\nknown to talk with the Navajo healers who lived in the area and who had observed the connection\nbetween rainfall and mice populations, thereby predicting the 1993 outbreak.\nThe cause of the disease, determined within a few weeks by the CDC investigators, was the hantavirus\nknown as Sin Nombre, the virus with \u201cno name.\u201d With insights from traditional Navajo medicine,\nscientists were able to characterize the disease rapidly and institute effective health measures to prevent\nits spread. This example illustrates the importance of understanding the complexities of ecosystems and\nhow they respond to changes in the environment.\nChapter Outline\n46.1 Ecology of\nEcosystems\n46.2 Energy Flow\nthrough\nEcosystems\n46.3 Biogeochemical\nCycles\nLife in an ecosystem is often about competition for limited resources, a characteristic of the theory of\nnatural selection. Competition in communities (all living things within specific habitats) is observed both\nwithin species and among different species. The resources for which organisms compete include organic\nmaterial, sunlight, and mineral nutrients, which provide the energy for living processes and the matter to\nmake up organisms\u2019 physical structures. Other critical factors influencing community dynamics are the\ncomponents of its physical and geographic environment: a habitat\u2019s latitude, amount of rainfall, topography\n(elevation), and available species. These are all important environmental variables that determine which\norganisms can exist within a particular area.\nAn ecosystem is a community of living organisms and their interactions with their abiotic (nonliving)\nenvironment. Ecosystems can be small, such as the tide pools found near the rocky shores of many oceans,\nor large, such as the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil (Figure 46.2).\nFigure 46.2 A (a) tidal pool ecosystem in Matinicus Island in Maine is a small ecosystem, while the (b) Amazon\nRainforest in Brazil is a large ecosystem. (credit a: modification of work by \u201ctakomabibelot\u201d/Flickr; credit b:\nmodification of work by Ivan Mlinaric)\nThere are three broad categories of ecosystems based on their general environment: freshwater, ocean water,\nand terrestrial. Within these broad categories are individual ecosystem types based on the organisms\npresent and the type of environmental habitat.\nOcean ecosystems are the most common, comprising over 70 percent of the Earth's surface and consisting of\nthree basic types: shallow ocean, deep ocean water, and deep ocean surfaces (the low depth areas of the deep\noceans). The shallow ocean ecosystems include extremely biodiverse coral reef ecosystems, and the deep\nocean surface is known for its large numbers of plankton and krill (small crustaceans) that support it. These\ntwo environments are especially important to aerobic respirators worldwide as the phytoplankton perform\n40 percent of all photosynthesis on Earth. Although not as diverse as the other two, deep ocean ecosystems\ncontain a wide variety of marine organisms. Such ecosystems exist even at the bottom of the ocean where\nlight is unable to penetrate through the water.\nFreshwater ecosystems are the rarest, occurring on only 1.8 percent of the Earth's surface. Lakes, rivers,\nstreams, and springs comprise these systems. They are quite diverse, and they support a variety of fish,\namphibians, reptiles, insects, phytoplankton, fungi, and bacteria.\nTerrestrial ecosystems, also known for their diversity, are grouped into large categories called biomes, such\nas tropical rain forests, savannas, deserts, coniferous forests, deciduous forests, and tundra. Grouping these\necosystems into just a few biome categories obscures the great diversity of the individual ecosystems within\nthem. For example, there is great variation in desert vegetation: the saguaro cacti and other plant life in the\nSonoran Desert, in the United States, are relatively abundant compared to the desolate rocky desert of Boa\nVista, an island off the coast of Western Africa (Figure 46.3).\n1342\nChapter 46 \u2022 Ecosystems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 46.3 Desert ecosystems, like all ecosystems, can vary greatly. The desert in (a) Saguaro National Park, Arizona, has abundant plant\nlife, while the rocky desert of (b) Boa Vista island, Cape Verde, Africa, is devoid of plant life. (credit a: modification of work by Jay Galvin;\ncredit b: modification of work by Ingo W\u00f6lbern)\nEcosystems are complex with many interacting parts. They are routinely exposed to various disturbances, or changes in the\nenvironment that effect their compositions: yearly variations in rainfall and temperature and the slower processes of plant\ngrowth, which may take several years. Many of these disturbances result from natural processes. For example, when lightning\ncauses a forest fire and destroys part of a forest ecosystem, the ground is eventually populated by grasses, then by bushes and\nshrubs, and later by mature trees, restoring the forest to its former state. The impact of environmental disturbances caused by\nhuman activities is as important as the changes wrought by natural processes. Human agricultural practices, air pollution, acid\nrain, global deforestation, overfishing, eutrophication, oil spills, and waste dumping on land and into the ocean are all issues of\nconcern to conservationists.\nEquilibrium is the steady state of an ecosystem where all organisms are in balance with their environment and with each other.\nIn ecology, two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems: resistance and resilience. Resistance is the ability of an\necosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances. Resilience is the speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium\nafter being disturbed. Ecosystem resistance and resilience are especially important when considering human impact. The\nnature of an ecosystem may change to such a degree that it can lose its resilience entirely. This process can lead to the complete\ndestruction or irreversible altering of the ecosystem.\nFood Chains and Food Webs\nThe term \u201cfood chain\u201d is sometimes used metaphorically to describe human social situations. Individuals who are considered\nsuccessful are seen as being at the top of the food chain, consuming all others for their benefit, whereas the less successful are\nseen as being at the bottom.\nThe scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage. In ecology, a food chain is a linear\nsequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass: primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level\nconsumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics. There is a single path through the chain. Each organism in a\nfood chain occupies what is called a trophic level. Depending on their role as producers or consumers, species or groups of\nspecies can be assigned to various trophic levels.\nIn many ecosystems, the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms (plants and/or phytoplankton), which\nare called primary producers. The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores: the primary consumers.\nSecondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers. Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other\ncarnivores. Higher-level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels, and so on, up to the organisms at the top of the food\nchain: the apex consumers. In the Lake Ontario food chain shown in Figure 46.4, the Chinook salmon is the apex consumer at\nthe top of this food chain.\n46.1 \u2022 Ecology of Ecosystems\n1343\nFigure 46.4 These are the trophic levels of a food chain in Lake Ontario at the United States-Canada border. Energy and nutrients flow from\nphotosynthetic green algae at the bottom to the top of the food chain: the Chinook salmon.\nOne major factor that limits the length of food chains is energy. Energy is lost as heat between each trophic level due to the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Thus, after a limited number of trophic energy transfers, the amount of energy remaining in the\nfood chain may not be great enough to support viable populations at yet a higher trophic level.\nThe loss of energy between trophic levels is illustrated by the pioneering studies of Howard T. Odum in the Silver Springs,\nFlorida, ecosystem in the 1940s (Figure 46.5). The primary producers generated 20,819 kcal/m2/yr (kilocalories per square meter\nper year), the primary consumers generated 3368 kcal/m2/yr, the secondary consumers generated 383 kcal/m2/yr, and the\ntertiary consumers only generated 21 kcal/m2/yr. Thus, there is little energy remaining for another level of consumers in this\necosystem.\n1344\nChapter 46 \u2022 Ecosystems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 46.5 The relative energy in trophic levels in a Silver Springs, Florida, ecosystem is shown. Each trophic level has less energy\navailable and supports fewer organisms at the next level.\nThere is a one problem when using food chains to accurately describe most ecosystems. Even when all organisms are grouped\ninto appropriate trophic levels, some of these organisms can feed on species from more than one trophic level; likewise, some of\nthese organisms can be eaten by species from multiple trophic levels. In other words, the linear model of ecosystems, the food\nchain, is not completely descriptive of ecosystem structure. A holistic model\u2014which accounts for all the interactions between\ndifferent species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the environment\u2014is a more accurate\nand descriptive model for ecosystems. A food web is a graphic representation of a holistic, nonlinear web of primary producers,\nprimary consumers, and higher-level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics (Figure 46.6).\nFigure 46.6 This food web shows the interactions between organisms across trophic levels in the Lake Ontario ecosystem. Primary\nproducers are outlined in green, primary consumers in orange, secondary consumers in blue, and tertiary (apex) consumers in purple.\nArrows point from an organism that is consumed to the organism that consumes it. Notice how some lines point to more than one trophic\nlevel. For example, the opossum shrimp eats both primary producers and primary consumers. (credit: NOAA, GLERL)\nA comparison of the two types of structural ecosystem models shows strength in both. Food chains are more flexible for\nanalytical modeling, are easier to follow, and are easier to experiment with, whereas food web models more accurately represent\necosystem structure and dynamics, and data can be directly used as input for simulation modeling.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHead to this online interactive simulator (http://openstax.org/l/food_web) to investigate food web function.

A grazing food web (such as the Lake\nOntario food web in Figure 46.6) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base, followed by herbivores and various\ncarnivores. A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter (dead organisms), called\ndecomposers or detritivores. These organisms are usually bacteria or fungi that recycle organic material back into the biotic part\nof the ecosystem as they themselves are consumed by other organisms. As all ecosystems require a method to recycle material\nfrom dead organisms, most grazing food webs have an associated detrital food web. For example, in a meadow ecosystem,\nplants may support a grazing food web of different organisms, primary and other levels of consumers, while at the same time\nsupporting a detrital food web of bacteria, fungi, and detrivorous invertebrates feeding off dead plants and animals.\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nThree-spined Stickleback\nIt is well established by the theory of natural selection that changes in the environment play a major role in the evolution of\nspecies within an ecosystem. However, little is known about how the evolution of species within an ecosystem can alter the\necosystem environment. In 2009, Dr. Luke Harmon, from the University of Idaho, published a paper that for the first time\nshowed that the evolution of organisms into subspecies can have direct effects on their ecosystem environment.1\nThe three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a freshwater fish that evolved from a saltwater fish to live in freshwater\nlakes about 10,000 years ago, which is considered a recent development in evolutionary time (Figure 46.7). Over the last 10,000\nyears, these freshwater fish then became isolated from each other in different lakes. Depending on which lake population was\nstudied, findings showed that these sticklebacks then either remained as one species or evolved into two species. The divergence\nof species was made possible by their use of different areas of the pond for feeding called micro niches.\nDr. Harmon and his team created artificial pond microcosms in 250-gallon tanks and added muck from freshwater ponds as a\nsource of zooplankton and other invertebrates to sustain the fish. In different experimental tanks they introduced one species of\nstickleback from either a single-species or double-species lake.\nOver time, the team observed that some of the tanks bloomed with algae while others did not. This puzzled the scientists, and\nthey decided to measure the water's dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which consists of mostly large molecules of decaying\norganic matter that give pond-water its slightly brownish color. It turned out that the water from the tanks with two-species fish\ncontained larger particles of DOC (and hence darker water) than water with single-species fish. This increase in DOC blocked\nthe sunlight and prevented algal blooming. Conversely, the water from the single-species tank contained smaller DOC particles,\nallowing more sunlight penetration to fuel the algal blooms.\nThis change in the environment, which is due to the different feeding habits of the stickleback species in each lake type, probably\nhas a great impact on the survival of other species in these ecosystems, especially other photosynthetic organisms. Thus, the\nstudy shows that, at least in these ecosystems, the environment and the evolution of populations have reciprocal effects that may\nnow be factored into simulation models.\n1Nature (Vol. 458, April 1, 2009)\n1346\nChapter 46 \u2022 Ecosystems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 46.7 The three-spined stickleback evolved from a saltwater fish to freshwater fish. (credit: Barrett Paul, USFWS)\nResearch into Ecosystem Dynamics: Ecosystem Experimentation and\nModeling\nThe study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment (disturbances) or by internal forces is\ncalled ecosystem dynamics. Ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research methodologies. Some ecologists study\necosystems using controlled experimental systems, while some study entire ecosystems in their natural state, and others use\nboth approaches.\nA holistic ecosystem model attempts to quantify the composition, interaction, and dynamics of entire ecosystems; it is the most\nrepresentative of the ecosystem in its natural state. A food web is an example of a holistic ecosystem model. However, this type\nof study is limited by time and expense, as well as the fact that it is neither feasible nor ethical to do experiments on large\nnatural ecosystems. It is difficult to quantify all different species in an ecosystem and the dynamics in their habitat, especially\nwhen studying large habitats such as the Amazon Rainforest.\nFor these reasons, scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions. Experimental systems usually involve either\npartitioning a part of a natural ecosystem that can be used for experiments, termed a mesocosm, or by recreating an ecosystem\nentirely in an indoor or outdoor laboratory environment, which is referred to as a microcosm. A major limitation to these\napproaches is that removing individual organisms from their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem through\npartitioning may change the dynamics of the ecosystem. These changes are often due to differences in species numbers and\ndiversity and also to environment alterations caused by partitioning (mesocosm) or recreating (microcosm) the natural habitat.\nThus, these types of experiments are not totally predictive of changes that would occur in the ecosystem from which they were\ngathered.\nAs both of these approaches have their limitations, some ecologists suggest that results from these experimental systems should\nbe used only in conjunction with holistic ecosystem studies to obtain the most representative data about ecosystem structure,\nfunction, and dynamics.\nScientists use the data generated by these experimental studies to develop ecosystem models that demonstrate the structure\nand dynamics of ecosystems. They use three basic types of ecosystem modeling in research and ecosystem management: a\nconceptual model, an analytical model, and a simulation model. A conceptual model is an ecosystem model that consists of flow\ncharts to show interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the ecosystem. A conceptual\nmodel describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances affect the ecosystem; however,\nits ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited. Analytical and simulation models, in contrast, are mathematical\nmethods of describing ecosystems that are indeed capable of predicting the effects of potential environmental changes without\ndirect experimentation, although with some limitations as to accuracy. An analytical model is an ecosystem model that is\ncreated using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and\ndynamics. A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model\necosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics. Ideally, these\nmodels are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances, and\nthey can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers (such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists) in the practical\n46.1 \u2022 Ecology of Ecosystems\n1347\nmaintenance of ecosystem health.\nConceptual Models\nConceptual models are useful for describing ecosystem structure and dynamics and for demonstrating the relationships\nbetween different organisms in a community and their environment. Conceptual models are usually depicted graphically as\nflow charts. The organisms and their resources are grouped into specific compartments with arrows showing the relationship\nand transfer of energy or nutrients between them. Thus, these diagrams are sometimes called compartment models.\nTo model the cycling of mineral nutrients, organic and inorganic nutrients are subdivided into those that are bioavailable (ready\nto be incorporated into biological macromolecules) and those that are not. For example, in a terrestrial ecosystem near a deposit\nof coal, carbon will be available to the plants of this ecosystem as carbon dioxide gas in a short-term period, not from the\ncarbon-rich coal itself. However, over a longer period, microorganisms capable of digesting coal will incorporate its carbon or\nrelease it as natural gas (methane, CH4), changing this unavailable organic source into an available one. This conversion is\ngreatly accelerated by the combustion of fossil fuels by humans, which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the\natmosphere. This is thought to be a major factor in the rise of the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the industrial age. The\ncarbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels is produced faster than photosynthetic organisms can use it. This process is\nintensified by the reduction of photosynthetic trees because of worldwide deforestation. Most scientists agree that high\natmospheric carbon dioxide is a major cause of global climate change.\nConceptual models are also used to show the flow of energy through particular ecosystems. Figure 46.8 is based on Howard T.\nOdum\u2019s classical study of the Silver Springs, Florida, holistic ecosystem in the mid-twentieth century.2 This study shows the\nenergy content and transfer between various ecosystem compartments.\n2Howard T. Odum, \u201cTrophic Structure and Productivity of Silver Springs, Florida,\u201d Ecological Monographs 27, no. 1 (1957): 47\u2013112.\n1348\nChapter 46 \u2022 Ecosystems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 46.8 This conceptual model shows the flow of energy through a spring ecosystem in Silver Springs, Florida. Notice that the energy\ndecreases with each increase in trophic level.\nWhy do you think the value for gross productivity of the primary producers is the same as the value for total heat and respiration\n(20,810 kcal/m2/yr)?\nAnalytical and Simulation Models\nThe major limitation of conceptual models is their inability to predict the consequences of changes in ecosystem species and/or\nenvironment. Ecosystems are dynamic entities and subject to a variety of abiotic and biotic disturbances caused by natural\nforces and/or human activity. Ecosystems altered from their initial equilibrium state can often recover from such disturbances\nand return to a state of equilibrium. As most ecosystems are subject to periodic disturbances and are often in a state of change,\nthey are usually either moving toward or away from their equilibrium state. There are many of these equilibrium states among\nthe various components of an ecosystem, which affects the ecosystem overall. Furthermore, as humans have the ability to\ngreatly and rapidly alter the species content and habitat of an ecosystem, the need for predictive models that enable\nunderstanding of how ecosystems respond to these changes becomes more crucial.\nAnalytical models often use simple, linear components of ecosystems, such as food chains, and are known to be complex\n46.1 \u2022 Ecology of Ecosystems\n1349\nmathematically; therefore, they require a significant amount of mathematical knowledge and expertise. Although analytical\nmodels have great potential, their simplification of complex ecosystems is thought to limit their accuracy. Simulation models\nthat use computer programs are better able to deal with the complexities of ecosystem structure.\nA recent development in simulation modeling uses supercomputers to create and run individual-based simulations, which\naccounts for the behavior of individual organisms and their effects on the ecosystem as a whole. These simulations are\nconsidered to be the most accurate and predictive of the complex responses of ecosystems to disturbances.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit The Darwin Project (http://openstax.org/l/Darwin_project) to view a variety of ecosystem models, including simulations\nthat model predator-prey relationships (https://openstax.org/l/Darwin_projct2) to learn more.\n46.2 Energy Flow through Ecosystems\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDescribe how organisms acquire energy in a food web and in associated food chains\n\u2022\nExplain how the efficiency of energy transfers between trophic levels affects ecosystem structure and\ndynamics\n\u2022\nDiscuss trophic levels and how ecological pyramids are used to model them\nAll living things require energy in one form or another. Energy is required by most complex metabolic pathways (often in the\nform of adenosine triphosphate, ATP), especially those responsible for building large molecules from smaller compounds, and\nlife itself is an energy-driven process. Living organisms would not be able to assemble macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic\nacids, and complex carbohydrates) from their monomeric subunits without a constant energy input.\nIt is important to understand how organisms acquire energy and how that energy is passed from one organism to another\nthrough food webs and their constituent food chains. Food webs illustrate how energy flows directionally through ecosystems,\nincluding how efficiently organisms acquire it, use it, and how much remains for use by other organisms of the food web.\nHow Organisms Acquire Energy in a Food Web\nEnergy is acquired by living things in three ways: photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, and the consumption and digestion of other\nliving or previously living organisms by heterotrophs.\nPhotosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms are both grouped into a category known as autotrophs: organisms capable of\nsynthesizing their own food (more specifically, capable of using inorganic carbon as a carbon source). Photosynthetic\nautotrophs (photoautotrophs) use sunlight as an energy source, whereas chemosynthetic autotrophs (chemoautotrophs) use\ninorganic molecules as an energy source. Autotrophs are critical for all ecosystems. Without these organisms, energy would not\nbe available to other living organisms and life itself would not be possible.\nPhotoautotrophs, such as plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, serve as the energy source for a majority of the world\u2019s\necosystems. These ecosystems are often described by grazing food webs. Photoautotrophs harness the solar energy of the sun by\nconverting it to chemical energy in the form of ATP (and NADP). The energy stored in ATP is used to synthesize complex organic\nmolecules, such as glucose.\nChemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available, such as in those\nassociated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean (Figure 46.9). Many chemoautotrophs in\nhydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy. This allows\nchemoautotrophs to synthesize complex organic molecules, such as glucose, for their own energy and in turn supplies energy to\nthe rest of the ecosystem.\n1350\nChapter 46 \u2022 Ecosystems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 46.9 Swimming shrimp, a few squat lobsters, and hundreds of vent mussels are seen at a hydrothermal vent at the bottom of the\nocean. As no sunlight penetrates to this depth, the ecosystem is supported by chemoautotrophic bacteria and organic material that sinks\nfrom the ocean\u2019s surface. This picture was taken in 2006 at the submerged NW Eifuku volcano off the coast of Japan by the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The summit of this highly active volcano lies 1535 m below the surface.\nProductivity within Trophic Levels\nProductivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem incorporated into biomass\nin a particular trophic level. Biomass is the total mass, in a unit area at the time of measurement, of living or previously living\norganisms within a trophic level. Ecosystems have characteristic amounts of biomass at each trophic level. For example, in the\nEnglish Channel ecosystem the primary producers account for a biomass of 4 g/m2 (grams per square meter), while the primary\nconsumers exhibit a biomass of 21 g/m2.\nThe productivity of the primary producers is especially important in any ecosystem because these organisms bring energy to\nother living organisms by photoautotrophy or chemoautotrophy. The rate at which photosynthetic primary producers\nincorporate energy from the sun is called gross primary productivity. An example of gross primary productivity is shown in the\ncompartment diagram of energy flow within the Silver Springs aquatic ecosystem as shown (Figure 46.8). In this ecosystem, the\ntotal energy accumulated by the primary producers (gross primary productivity) was shown to be 20,810 kcal/m2/yr.\nBecause all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions (like respiration and resulting metabolic heat loss)\nscientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem. Net primary productivity is the energy that remains in\nthe primary producers after accounting for the organisms\u2019 respiration and heat loss. The net productivity is then available to the\nprimary consumers at the next trophic level. In our Silver Springs example, 13,187 of the 20,810 kcal/m2/yr were used for\nrespiration or were lost as heat, leaving 7,633 kcal/m2/yr of energy for use by the primary consumers.\nEcological Efficiency: The Transfer of Energy between Trophic Levels\nAs illustrated in (Figure 46.8), as energy flows from primary producers through the various trophic levels, the ecosystem loses\nlarge amounts of energy. The main reason for this loss is the second law of thermodynamics, which states that whenever energy\nis converted from one form to another, there is a tendency toward disorder (entropy) in the system. In biologic systems, this\nenergy takes the form of metabolic heat, which is lost when the organisms consume other organisms. In the Silver Springs\necosystem example (Figure 46.8), we see that the primary consumers produced 1103 kcal/m2/yr from the 7618 kcal/m2/yr of\nenergy available to them from the primary producers. The measurement of energy transfer efficiency between two successive\ntrophic levels is termed the trophic level transfer efficiency (TLTE) and is defined by the formula:\nIn Silver Springs, the TLTE between the first two trophic levels was approximately 14.8 percent. The low efficiency of energy\n46.2 \u2022 Energy Flow through Ecosystems\n1351\ntransfer between trophic levels is usually the major factor that limits the length of food chains observed in a food web. The fact\nis, after four to six energy transfers, there is not enough energy left to support another trophic level. In the Lake Ontario\nexample shown in (Figure 46.6), only three energy transfers occurred between the primary producer, (green algae), and the apex\nconsumer (Chinook salmon).\nEcologists have many different methods of measuring energy transfers within ecosystems. Measurement difficulty depends on\nthe complexity of the ecosystem and how much access scientists have to observe the ecosystem. In other words, some\necosystems are more difficult to study than others, and sometimes the quantification of energy transfers has to be estimated.\nOther parameters are important in characterizing energy flow within an ecosystem. Net production efficiency (NPE) allows\necologists to quantify how efficiently organisms of a particular trophic level incorporate the energy they receive into biomass; it\nis calculated using the following formula:\nNet consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level. Assimilation is the\nbiomass (energy content generated per unit area) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to\nincomplete ingestion of food, energy used for respiration, and energy lost as waste. Incomplete ingestion refers to the fact that\nsome consumers eat only a part of their food. For example, when a lion kills an antelope, it will eat everything except the hide\nand bones. The lion is missing the energy-rich bone marrow inside the bone, so the lion does not make use of all the calories its\nprey could provide.\nThus, NPE measures how efficiently each trophic level uses and incorporates the energy from its food into biomass to fuel the\nnext trophic level. In general, cold-blooded animals (ectotherms), such as invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and reptiles, use less\nof the energy they obtain for respiration and heat than warm-blooded animals (endotherms), such as birds and mammals. The\nextra heat generated in endotherms, although an advantage in terms of the activity of these organisms in colder environments,\nis a major disadvantage in terms of NPE. Therefore, many endotherms have to eat more often than ectotherms to get the energy\nthey need for survival. In general, NPE for ectotherms is an order of magnitude (10x) higher than for endotherms. For example,\nthe NPE for a caterpillar eating leaves has been measured at 18 percent, whereas the NPE for a squirrel eating acorns may be as\nlow as 1.6 percent.\nThe inefficiency of energy use by warm-blooded animals has broad implications for the world's food supply. It is widely accepted\nthat the meat industry uses large amounts of crops to feed livestock, and because the NPE is low, much of the energy from\nanimal feed is lost. For example, it costs about $0.01 to produce 1000 dietary calories (kcal) of corn or soybeans, but\napproximately $0.19 to produce a similar number of calories growing cattle for beef consumption. The same energy content of\nmilk from cattle is also costly, at approximately $0.16 per 1000 kcal. Much of this difference is due to the low NPE of cattle. Thus,\nthere has been a growing movement worldwide to promote the consumption of nonmeat and nondairy foods so that less energy\nis wasted feeding animals for the meat industry.\nModeling Ecosystems Energy Flow: Ecological Pyramids\nThe structure of ecosystems can be visualized with ecological pyramids, which were first described by the pioneering studies of\nCharles Elton in the 1920s. Ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of various parameters (such as number of organisms,\nenergy, and biomass) across trophic levels.\nPyramids of numbers can be either upright or inverted, depending on the ecosystem. As shown in Figure 46.10, typical\ngrassland during the summer has a base of many plants, and the numbers of organisms decrease at each trophic level. However,\nduring the summer in a temperate forest, the base of the pyramid consists of few trees compared with the number of primary\nconsumers, mostly insects. Because trees are large, they have great photosynthetic capability, and dominate other plants in this\necosystem to obtain sunlight. Even in smaller numbers, primary producers in forests are still capable of supporting other\ntrophic levels.\nAnother way to visualize ecosystem structure is with pyramids of biomass. This pyramid measures the amount of energy\nconverted into living tissue at the different trophic levels. Using the Silver Springs ecosystem example, this data exhibits an\nupright biomass pyramid (Figure 46.10), whereas the pyramid from the English Channel example is inverted. The plants\n(primary producers) of the Silver Springs ecosystem make up a large percentage of the biomass found there. However, the\nphytoplankton in the English Channel example make up less biomass than the primary consumers, the zooplankton. As with\n1352\nChapter 46 \u2022 Ecosystems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ninverted pyramids of numbers, this inverted pyramid is not due to a lack of productivity from the primary producers, but results\nfrom the high turnover rate of the phytoplankton. The phytoplankton are consumed rapidly by the primary consumers, thus,\nminimizing their biomass at any particular point in time. However, phytoplankton reproduce quickly, thus they are able to\nsupport the rest of the ecosystem.\nPyramid ecosystem modeling can also be used to show energy flow through the trophic levels. Notice that these numbers are the\nsame as those used in the energy flow compartment diagram in (Figure 46.8). Pyramids of energy are always upright, and an\necosystem without sufficient primary productivity cannot be supported. All types of ecological pyramids are useful for\ncharacterizing ecosystem structure. However, in the study of energy flow through the ecosystem, pyramids of energy are the\nmost consistent and representative models of ecosystem structure (Figure 46.10).\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 46.10 Ecological pyramids depict the (a) biomass, (b) number of organisms, and (c) energy in each trophic level.\nPyramids depicting the number of organisms or biomass may be inverted, upright, or even diamond-shaped. Energy pyramids,\nhowever, are always upright. Why?\nConsequences of Food Webs: Biological Magnification\nOne of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification. Biomagnification is the\nincreasing concentration of persistent, toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level, from the primary producers to the\napex consumers. Many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate, including the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane\n(DDT), which was described in the 1960s bestseller, Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson. DDT was a commonly used pesticide before\nits dangers became known. In some aquatic ecosystems, organisms from each trophic level consumed many organisms of the\nlower level, which caused DDT to increase in birds (apex consumers) that ate fish. Thus, the birds accumulated sufficient\namounts of DDT to cause fragility in their eggshells. This effect increased egg breakage during nesting and was shown to have\nadverse effects on these bird populations. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in the 1970s.\nOther substances that biomagnify are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were used in coolant liquids in the United States\nuntil their use was banned in 1979, and heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. These substances were best studied\n46.2 \u2022 Energy Flow through Ecosystems\n1353\nin aquatic ecosystems, where fish species at different trophic levels accumulate toxic substances brought through the ecosystem\nby the primary producers. As illustrated in a study performed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\nin the Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron (Figure 46.11), PCB concentrations increased from the ecosystem\u2019s primary producers\n(phytoplankton) through the different trophic levels of fish species. The apex consumer (walleye) has more than four times the\namount of PCBs compared to phytoplankton. Also, based on results from other studies, birds that eat these fish may have PCB\nlevels at least one order of magnitude higher than those found in the lake fish.\nFigure 46.11 This chart shows the PCB concentrations found at the various trophic levels in the Saginaw Bay ecosystem of Lake Huron.\nNumbers on the x-axis reflect enrichment with heavy isotopes of nitrogen (15N), which is a marker for increasing trophic level. Notice that\nthe fish in the higher trophic levels accumulate more PCBs than those in lower trophic levels. (credit: Patricia Van Hoof, NOAA, GLERL)\nOther concerns have been raised by the accumulation of heavy metals, such as mercury and cadmium, in certain types of\nseafood. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that pregnant women and young children\nshould not consume any swordfish, shark, king mackerel, or tilefish because of their high mercury content. These individuals\nare advised to eat fish low in mercury: salmon, tilapia, shrimp, pollock, and catfish. Biomagnification is a good example of how\necosystem dynamics can affect our everyday lives, even influencing the food we eat.\n46.3 Biogeochemical Cycles\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDiscuss the biogeochemical cycles of water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur\n\u2022\nExplain how human activities have impacted these cycles and the potential consequences for Earth\nEnergy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as sunlight (or inorganic molecules for chemoautotrophs) and leaving\nas heat during the many transfers between trophic levels. However, the matter that makes up living organisms is conserved and\nrecycled. The six most common elements associated with organic molecules\u2014carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus,\nand sulfur\u2014take a variety of chemical forms and may exist for long periods in the atmosphere, on land, in water, or beneath the\nEarth\u2019s surface. Geologic processes, such as weathering, erosion, water drainage, and the subduction of the continental plates,\nall play a role in this recycling of materials. Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process, the\nrecycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a biogeochemical cycle.\nWater contains hydrogen and oxygen, which is essential to all living processes. The hydrosphere is the area of the Earth where\nwater movement and storage occurs. On or beneath the surface, water occurs in liquid or solid form in rivers, lakes, oceans,\ngroundwater, polar ice caps, and glaciers. And it occurs as water vapor in the atmosphere. Carbon is found in all organic\nmacromolecules and is an important constituent of fossil fuels. Nitrogen is a major component of our nucleic acids and proteins\nand is critical to human agriculture. Phosphorus, a major component of nucleic acid (along with nitrogen), is one of the main\ningredients in artificial fertilizers used in agriculture and their associated environmental impacts on our surface water. Sulfur is\n1354\nChapter 46 \u2022 Ecosystems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\ncritical to the 3-D folding of proteins, such as in disulfide binding.\nThe cycling of these elements is interconnected. For example, the movement of water is critical for the leaching of nitrogen and\nphosphate into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Furthermore, the ocean itself is a major reservoir for carbon. Thus, mineral nutrients\nare cycled, either rapidly or slowly, through the entire biosphere, from one living organism to another, and between the biotic\nand abiotic world.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHead to this website (http://openstax.org/l/biogeochemical) to learn more about biogeochemical cycles.\nThe Water (Hydrologic) Cycle\nWater is the basis of all living processes on Earth. When examining the stores of water on Earth, 97.5 percent of it is non-potable\nsalt water (Figure 46.12). Of the remaining water, 99 percent is locked underground as water or as ice. Thus, less than 1 percent of\nfresh water is easily accessible from lakes and rivers. Many living things, such as plants, animals, and fungi, are dependent on\nthat small amount of fresh surface water, a lack of which can have massive effects on ecosystem dynamics. To be successful,\norganisms must adapt to fluctuating water supplies. Humans, of course, have developed technologies to increase water\navailability, such as digging wells to harvest groundwater, storing rainwater, and using desalination to obtain drinkable water\nfrom the ocean.\nFigure 46.12 Only 2.5 percent of water on Earth is fresh water, and less than 1 percent of fresh water is easily accessible to living things.\nWater cycling is extremely important to ecosystem dynamics. Water has a major influence on climate and, thus, on the\nenvironments of ecosystems. Most of the water on Earth is stored for long periods in the oceans, underground, and as ice.\nFigure 46.13 illustrates the average time that an individual water molecule may spend in the Earth\u2019s major water reservoirs.\nResidence time is a measure of the average time an individual water molecule stays in a particular reservoir.\n46.3 \u2022 Biogeochemical Cycles\n1355\nFigure 46.13 This graph shows the average residence time for water molecules in the Earth\u2019s water reservoirs.\nThere are various processes that occur during the cycling of water, shown in Figure 46.14. These processes include the following:\n\u2022\nevaporation/sublimation\n\u2022\ncondensation/precipitation\n\u2022\nsubsurface water flow\n\u2022\nsurface runoff/snowmelt\n\u2022\nstreamflow\nThe water cycle is driven by the sun\u2019s energy as it warms the oceans and other surface waters. This leads to the evaporation\n(water to water vapor) of liquid surface water and the sublimation (ice to water vapor) of frozen water, which deposits large\namounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. Over time, this water vapor condenses into clouds as liquid or frozen droplets and\nis eventually followed by precipitation (rain or snow), which returns water to the Earth\u2019s surface. Rain eventually permeates into\nthe ground, where it may evaporate again if it is near the surface, flow beneath the surface, or be stored for long periods. More\neasily observed is surface runoff: the flow of fresh water either from rain or melting ice. Runoff can then make its way through\nstreams and lakes to the oceans or flow directly to the oceans themselves.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHead to this website (http://openstax.org/l/freshwater) to learn more about the world\u2019s fresh water supply.\nRain and surface runoff are major ways in which minerals, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, are cycled from\nland to water. The environmental effects of runoff will be discussed later as these cycles are described.\n1356\nChapter 46 \u2022 Ecosystems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 46.14 Water from the land and oceans enters the atmosphere by evaporation or sublimation, where it condenses into clouds and\nfalls as rain or snow. Precipitated water may enter freshwater bodies or infiltrate the soil. The cycle is complete when surface or\ngroundwater reenters the ocean. (credit: modification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)\nThe Carbon Cycle\nCarbon is the second most abundant element in living organisms. Carbon is present in all organic molecules, and its role in the\nstructure of macromolecules is of primary importance to living organisms.\nThe carbon cycle is most easily studied as two interconnected sub-cycles: one dealing with rapid carbon exchange among living\norganisms and the other dealing with the long-term cycling of carbon through geologic processes. The entire carbon cycle is\nshown in Figure 46.15.\n46.3 \u2022 Biogeochemical Cycles\n1357\nFigure 46.15 Carbon dioxide gas exists in the atmosphere and is dissolved in water. Photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide gas to organic\ncarbon, and respiration cycles the organic carbon back into carbon dioxide gas. Long-term storage of organic carbon occurs when matter\nfrom living organisms is buried deep underground and becomes fossilized. Volcanic activity and, more recently, human emissions, bring this\nstored carbon back into the carbon cycle. (credit: modification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick this link (http://openstax.org/l/carbon_cycle) to read information about the United States Carbon Cycle Science Program.\nThe Biological Carbon Cycle\nLiving organisms are connected in many ways, even between ecosystems. A good example of this connection is the exchange of\ncarbon between autotrophs and heterotrophs within and between ecosystems by way of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Carbon\ndioxide is the basic building block that most autotrophs use to build multicarbon, high energy compounds, such as glucose. The\nenergy harnessed from the sun is used by these organisms to form the covalent bonds that link carbon atoms together. These\nchemical bonds thereby store this energy for later use in the process of respiration. Most terrestrial autotrophs obtain their\ncarbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, while marine autotrophs acquire it in the dissolved form (carbonic acid, H2CO3\u2212).\nHowever carbon dioxide is acquired, a by-product of the process is oxygen. The photosynthetic organisms are responsible for\ndepositing approximately 21 percent oxygen content of the atmosphere that we observe today.\nHeterotrophs and autotrophs are partners in biological carbon exchange (especially the primary consumers, largely herbivores).\nHeterotrophs acquire the high-energy carbon compounds from the autotrophs by consuming them, and breaking them down by\nrespiration to obtain cellular energy, such as ATP. The most efficient type of respiration, aerobic respiration, requires oxygen\nobtained from the atmosphere or dissolved in water. Thus, there is a constant exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between\nthe autotrophs (which need the carbon) and the heterotrophs (which need the oxygen). Gas exchange through the atmosphere\nand water is one way that the carbon cycle connects all living organisms on Earth.\nThe Biogeochemical Carbon Cycle\nThe movement of carbon through the land, water, and air is complex, and in many cases, it occurs much more slowly\ngeologically than as seen between living organisms. Carbon is stored for long periods in what are known as carbon reservoirs,\nwhich include the atmosphere, bodies of liquid water (mostly oceans), ocean sediment, soil, land sediments (including fossil\nfuels), and the Earth\u2019s interior.\n1358\nChapter 46 \u2022 Ecosystems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nAs stated, the atmosphere is a major reservoir of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and is essential to the process of\nphotosynthesis. The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans. The\nexchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each location, and\neach one affects the other reciprocally. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere dissolves in water and combines with water\nmolecules to form carbonic acid, and then it ionizes to carbonate and bicarbonate ions (Figure 46.16)\nFigure 46.16 Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form bicarbonate and carbonate ions.\nThe equilibrium coefficients are such that more than 90 percent of the carbon in the ocean is found as bicarbonate ions. Some of\nthese ions combine with seawater calcium to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a major component of marine organism shells.\nThese organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor. Over geologic time, the calcium carbonate forms limestone,\nwhich comprises the largest carbon reservoir on Earth.\nOn land, carbon is stored in soil as a result of the decomposition of living organisms (by decomposers) or from weathering of\nterrestrial rock and minerals. This carbon can be leached into the water reservoirs by surface runoff. Deeper underground, on\nland and at sea, are fossil fuels: the anaerobically decomposed remains of plants that take millions of years to form. Fossil fuels\nare considered a nonrenewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation. A nonrenewable resource, such\nas fossil fuel, is either regenerated very slowly or not at all. Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land\n(including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems. Carbon sediments\nfrom the ocean floor are taken deep within the Earth by the process of subduction: the movement of one tectonic plate beneath\nanother. Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents.\nHumans contribute to atmospheric carbon by the burning of fossil fuels and other materials. Since the Industrial Revolution,\nhumans have significantly increased the release of carbon and carbon compounds, which has in turn affected the climate and\noverall environment.\nAnimal husbandry by humans also increases atmospheric carbon. The large numbers of land animals raised to feed the Earth\u2019s\ngrowing population results in increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere due to farming practices and respiration and\nmethane production. This is another example of how human activity indirectly affects biogeochemical cycles in a significant\nway. Although much of the debate about the future effects of increasing atmospheric carbon on climate change focuses on\nfossils fuels, scientists take natural processes, such as volcanoes and respiration, into account as they model and predict the\nfuture impact of this increase.\nThe Nitrogen Cycle\nGetting nitrogen into the living world is difficult. Plants and phytoplankton are not equipped to incorporate nitrogen from the\natmosphere (which exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N2) even though this molecule comprises approximately 78 percent\nof the atmosphere. Nitrogen enters the living world via free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their\nmacromolecules through nitrogen fixation (conversion of N2). Cyanobacteria live in most aquatic ecosystems where sunlight is\npresent; they play a key role in nitrogen fixation. Cyanobacteria are able to use inorganic sources of nitrogen to \u201cfix\u201d nitrogen.\nRhizobium bacteria live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, beans, and peanuts) and provide them with\nthe organic nitrogen they need. (For example, gardeners often grow peas both for their produce and to naturally add nitrogen to\nthe soil. This practice goes back to ancient times, even if the science has only been recently understood.) Free-living bacteria,\nsuch as Azotobacter, are also important nitrogen fixers.\nOrganic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics since many ecosystem processes, such as primary\nproduction and decomposition, are limited by the available supply of nitrogen. As shown in Figure 46.17, the nitrogen that\nenters living systems by nitrogen fixation is successively converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen gas by bacteria.\nThis process occurs in three steps in terrestrial systems: ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. First, the\nammonification process converts nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead animals into ammonium\n46.3 \u2022 Biogeochemical Cycles\n1359\n(NH4+) by certain bacteria and fungi. Second, the ammonium is converted to nitrites (NO2\u2212) by nitrifying bacteria, such as\nNitrosomonas, through nitrification. Subsequently, nitrites are converted to nitrates (NO3\u2212) by similar organisms. Third, the\nprocess of denitrification occurs, whereby bacteria, such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium, convert the nitrates into nitrogen\ngas, allowing it to reenter the atmosphere.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 46.17 Nitrogen enters the living world from the atmosphere via nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This nitrogen and nitrogenous waste from\nanimals is then processed back into gaseous nitrogen by soil bacteria, which also supply terrestrial food webs with the organic nitrogen\nthey need.

Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)\nWhich of the following statements about the nitrogen cycle is false?\na.\nAmmonification converts organic nitrogenous matter from living organisms into ammonium (NH4+).\nb.\nDenitrification by bacteria converts nitrates (NO3\u2212) to nitrogen gas (N2).\nc.\nNitrification by bacteria converts nitrates (NO3\u2212) to nitrites (NO2\u2212).\nd.\nNitrogen fixing bacteria convert nitrogen gas (N2) into organic compounds.\n1360\nChapter 46 \u2022 Ecosystems\nHuman activity can release nitrogen into the environment by two primary means: the combustion of fossil fuels, which releases \ndifferent nitrogen oxides, and by the use of artificial fertilizers in agriculture, which are then washed into lakes, streams, and \nrivers by surface runoff. Atmospheric nitrogen is associated with several effects on Earth\u2019s ecosystems including the production \nof acid rain (as nitric acid, HNO3) and greenhouse gas (as nitrous oxide, N2O) potentially causing climate change. A major effect \nfrom fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater eutrophication, a process whereby nutrient runoff causes the excess growth of \nmicroorganisms, depleting dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna.\nA similar process occurs in the marine nitrogen cycle, where the ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification processes are \nperformed by marine bacteria. Some of this nitrogen falls to the ocean floor as sediment, which can then be moved to land in \ngeologic time by uplift of the Earth\u2019s surface and thereby incorporated into terrestrial rock. Although the movement of nitrogen \nfrom rock directly into living systems has been traditionally seen as insignificant compared with nitrogen fixed from the \natmosphere, a recent study showed that this process may indeed be significant and should be included in any study of the global \nnitrogen cycle.3\n3Scott L. Morford, Benjamin Z. Houlton, and Randy A. Dahlgren, \u201cIncreased Forest Ecosystem Carbon and Nitrogen Storage from Nitrogen Rich\nBedrock,\u201d Nature 477, no. 7362 (2011): 78\u201381.\nThe Phosphorus Cycle\nPhosphorus is an essential nutrient for living processes; it is a major component of nucleic acid and phospholipids, and, as\ncalcium phosphate, makes up the supportive components of our bones. Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary for\ngrowth) in aquatic ecosystems (Figure 46.18).\nPhosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion (PO43\u2212). In addition to phosphate runoff as a result of human activity, natural\nsurface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphate-containing rock by weathering, thus sending phosphates into rivers,\nlakes, and the ocean. This rock has its origins in the ocean. Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the\nbodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions. However, in remote regions, volcanic ash, aerosols, and mineral dust may\nalso be significant phosphate sources. This sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the uplifting of areas of the\nEarth\u2019s surface.\nPhosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marine ecosystems. The movement of\nphosphate from the ocean to the land and through the soil is extremely slow, with the average phosphate ion having an oceanic\nresidence time between 20,000 and 100,000 years.\nFigure 46.18 In nature, phosphorus exists as the phosphate ion (PO43\u2212). Weathering of rocks and volcanic activity releases phosphate into\nthe soil, water, and air, where it becomes available to terrestrial food webs. Phosphate enters the oceans via surface runoff, groundwater\nflow, and river flow. Phosphate dissolved in ocean water cycles into marine food webs. Some phosphate from the marine food webs falls to\nthe ocean floor, where it forms sediment. (credit: modification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)\nAs discussed in Chapter 44, excess phosphorus and nitrogen that enters these ecosystems from fertilizer runoff and from\nsewage causes excessive growth of microorganisms and depletes the dissolved oxygen, which leads to the death of many\necosystem fauna, such as shellfish and finfish. This process is responsible for dead zones in lakes and at the mouths of many\nmajor rivers (Figure 46.19).\n46.3 \u2022 Biogeochemical Cycles\n1361\nFigure 46.19 Dead zones occur when phosphorus and nitrogen from fertilizers cause excessive growth of microorganisms, which depletes\noxygen and kills fauna. Worldwide, large dead zones are found in coastal areas of high population density. (credit: NASA Earth Observatory)\nAs discussed earlier, a dead zone is an area within a freshwater or marine ecosystem where large areas are depleted of their\nnormal flora and fauna; these zones can be caused by eutrophication, oil spills, dumping of toxic chemicals, and other human\nactivities. The number of dead zones has been increasing for several years, and more than 400 of these zones were present as of\n2008. One of the worst dead zones is off the coast of the United States in the Gulf of Mexico, where fertilizer runoff from the\nMississippi River basin has created a dead zone of over 8463 square miles. Phosphate and nitrate runoff from fertilizers also\nnegatively affect several lake and bay ecosystems including the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States.\nEveryday Connection\nChesapeake Bay\nFigure 46.20 This (a) satellite image shows the Chesapeake Bay, an ecosystem affected by phosphate and nitrate runoff. A (b) member\nof the Army Corps of Engineers holds a clump of oysters being used as a part of the oyster restoration effort in the bay.

As a part of the amino acid cysteine, it is involved in the\nformation of disulfide bonds within proteins, which help to determine their 3-D folding patterns, and hence their functions. As\nshown in Figure 46.21, sulfur cycles between the oceans, land, and atmosphere. Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of\nsulfur dioxide (SO2) and enters the atmosphere in three ways: from the decomposition of organic molecules, from volcanic\nactivity and geothermal vents, and from the burning of fossil fuels by humans.\nThe Chesapeake Bay has long been valued as one of the most scenic areas on Earth; it is now in distress and is recognized as\na declining ecosystem. In the 1970s, the Chesapeake Bay was one of the first ecosystems to have identified dead zones,\nwhich continue to kill many fish and bottom-dwelling species, such as clams, oysters, and worms. Several species have\ndeclined in the Chesapeake Bay due to surface water runoff containing excess nutrients from artificial fertilizer used on\nland. The source of the fertilizers (with high nitrogen and phosphate content) is not limited to agricultural practices. There\nare many nearby urban areas and more than 150 rivers and streams empty into the bay that are carrying fertilizer runoff\nfrom lawns and gardens. Thus, the decline of the Chesapeake Bay is a complex issue and requires the cooperation of\nindustry, agriculture, and everyday homeowners.\nOf particular interest to conservationists is the oyster population; it is estimated that more than 200,000 acres of oyster\nreefs existed in the bay in the 1700s, but that number has now declined to only 36,000 acres. Oyster harvesting was once a\nmajor industry for Chesapeake Bay, but it declined 88 percent between 1982 and 2007. This decline was due not only to\nfertilizer runoff and dead zones but also to overharvesting. Oysters require a certain minimum population density because\nthey must be in close proximity to reproduce. Human activity has altered the oyster population and locations, greatly\ndisrupting the ecosystem.\nThe restoration of the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing for several years with mixed success. Not\nonly do many people find oysters good to eat, but they also clean up the bay. Oysters are filter feeders, and as they eat, they\nclean the water around them. In the 1700s, it was estimated that it took only a few days for the oyster population to filter the\nentire volume of the bay. Today, with changed water conditions, it is estimated that the present population would take\nnearly a year to do the same job.\nRestoration efforts have been ongoing for several years by nonprofit organizations, such as the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nThe restoration goal is to find a way to increase population density so the oysters can reproduce more efficiently. Many\ndisease-resistant varieties (developed at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science for the College of William and Mary) are\nnow available and have been used in the construction of experimental oyster reefs. Efforts to clean and restore the bay by\nVirginia and Delaware have been hampered because much of the pollution entering the bay comes from other states, which\nstresses the need for interstate cooperation to gain successful restoration.\nThe new, hearty oyster strains have also spawned a new and economically viable industry\u2014oyster aquaculture\u2014which not\nonly supplies oysters for food and profit, but also has the added benefit of cleaning the bay.\n46.3 \u2022 Biogeochemical Cycles\n1363\nFigure 46.21 Sulfur dioxide from the atmosphere becomes available to terrestrial and marine ecosystems when it is dissolved in\nprecipitation as weak sulfurous acid or when it falls directly to the Earth as fallout. Weathering of rocks also makes sulfates available to\nterrestrial ecosystems. Decomposition of living organisms returns sulfates to the ocean, soil, and atmosphere. (credit: modification of work\nby John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)\nOn land, sulfur is deposited in four major ways: precipitation, direct fallout from the atmosphere, rock weathering, and\ngeothermal vents (Figure 46.21). Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2), and as rain falls through the\natmosphere, sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfurous acid (H2SO3). Sulfur can also fall directly from the atmosphere in a\nprocess called fallout. Also, the weathering of sulfur-containing rocks releases sulfur into the soil. These rocks originate from\nocean sediments that are moved to land by the geologic uplifting of ocean sediments. Terrestrial ecosystems can then make use\nof these soil sulfates (\n), and upon the death and decomposition of these organisms, release the sulfur back into the\natmosphere as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas.\nFigure 46.22 At this sulfur vent in Lassen Volcanic National Park in northeastern California, the yellowish sulfur deposits are visible near the\nmouth of the vent.\n1364\nChapter 46 \u2022 Ecosystems\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nSulfur enters the ocean via runoff from land, from atmospheric fallout, and from underwater geothermal vents. Some\necosystems (Figure 46.9) rely on chemoautotrophs using sulfur as a biological energy source. This sulfur then supports marine\necosystems in the form of sulfates.\nHuman activities have played a major role in altering the balance of the global sulfur cycle. The burning of large quantities of\nfossil fuels, especially from coal, releases larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere. Acid rain is caused by\nrainwater falling to the ground through this sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuric acid. Acid rain damages the natural\nenvironment by lowering the pH of lakes, which kills many of the resident fauna; it also affects the man-made environment\nthrough the chemical degradation of buildings. For example, many marble monuments, such as the Lincoln Memorial in\nWashington, DC, have suffered significant damage from acid rain over the years.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick this link (http://openstax.org/l/climate_change) to learn more about global climate change.\n46.3 \u2022 Biogeochemical Cycles\n1365\n", "key_terms": "\nacid rain\ncorrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the\nground through sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak\nsulfuric acid;

(credit: modification of work by Rishabh Tatiraju, using NASA World Wind software)\nINTRODUCTION In the 1980s, biologists working in Lake Victoria in Africa discovered one of the most\nextraordinary products of evolution on the planet. Located in the Great Rift Valley, Lake Victoria is an\nenormous and deep lake about 68,900 km2 in area (larger than Lake Huron, the second largest of North\nAmerica\u2019s Great Lakes). Biologists were studying species of a family of fish called cichlids. When they\nsampled for fish in different locations of the lake, the researchers identified over 500 evolved species in\ntotal. However, the scientists soon discovered that the invasive Nile Perch was destroying the lake\u2019s\ncichlid population, bringing hundreds of cichlid species to extinction with devastating rapidity.\nChapter Outline\n47.1 The Biodiversity\nCrisis\n47.2 The Importance of\nBiodiversity to\nHuman Life\n47.3 Threats to\nBiodiversity\n47.4 Preserving\nBiodiversity\n47.1 The Biodiversity Crisis\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nDefine biodiversity in terms of species diversity and abundance\n\u2022\nDescribe biodiversity as the equilibrium of naturally fluctuating rates of extinction and\nspeciation\n\u2022\nIdentify historical causes of high extinction rates in Earth\u2019s history\nTraditionally, ecologists have measured biodiversity, a general term for the number of species present in the\nbiosphere, by taking into account both the number of species and their relative abundance to each other.\nBiodiversity can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living organisms. These estimation\nindices, which came from information theory, are most useful as a first step in quantifying biodiversity\nbetween and within ecosystems; they are less useful when the main concern among conservation biologists\nis simply the loss of biodiversity. However, biologists recognize that measures of biodiversity, in terms of\nspecies diversity, may help focus efforts to preserve the biologically or technologically important elements of\nbiodiversity.\nThe Lake Victoria cichlids provide an example with which we can begin to understand biodiversity. The\nbiologists studying cichlids in the 1980s discovered hundreds of cichlid species representing a variety of\nspecializations to specialized habitat types and specific feeding strategies: such as eating plankton floating\nin the water, scraping/eating algae from rocks, eating insect larvae from the lake bottom, and eating the\neggs of other species of cichlid. The cichlids of Lake Victoria are the product of an complex adaptive\nradiation. An adaptive radiation is a rapid (less than three million years in the case of the Lake Victoria\ncichlids) branching through speciation of a phylogenetic clade into many closely related species. Typically,\nthe species \u201cradiate\u201d into different habitats and niches. The Gal\u00e1pagos Island finches are an example of a\nmodest adaptive radiation with 15 species. The cichlids of Lake Victoria are an example of a spectacular\nadaptive radiation that formerly included about 500 species.\nAt the time biologists were making this discovery, some species began to quickly disappear. A culprit in\nthese declines was the Nile perch, a species of large predatory fish that was introduced to Lake Victoria by\nfisheries to feed the people living around the lake. The Nile perch was introduced in 1963, but its populations\ndid not begin to surge until the 1980s. The perch population grew by consuming cichlids, driving species\nafter species to the point of extinction (the disappearance of a species). In fact, there were several factors\nthat played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in Lake Victoria: the Nile perch, declining\nlake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of Lake Victoria, and increased fishing\npressure. Scientists had not even catalogued all of the species present\u2014so many were lost that were never\nnamed. The diversity is now a shadow of what it once was.\nThe cichlids of Lake Victoria are a thumbnail sketch of contemporary rapid species loss that occurs all over\nEarth that is caused primarily by human activity. Extinction is a natural process of macroevolution that\noccurs at the rate of about one out of 1 million species becoming extinct per year. The fossil record reveals\nthat there have been five periods of mass extinction in history with much higher rates of species loss, and\nthe rate of species loss today is comparable to those periods of mass extinction. However, there is a major\ndifference between the previous mass extinctions and the current extinction we are experiencing: human\nactivity. Specifically, three human activities have a major impact: 1) destruction of habitat, 2) introduction of\nexotic species, and 3) over-harvesting. Predictions of species loss within the next century, a tiny amount of\ntime on geological timescales, range from 10 percent to 50 percent. Extinctions on this scale have only\nhappened five other times in the history of the planet, and these extinctions were caused by cataclysmic\nevents that changed the course of the history of life in each instance.\nTypes of Biodiversity\nScientists generally accept that the term biodiversity describes the number and kinds of species and their\nabundance in a given location or on the planet. Species can be difficult to define, but most biologists still feel\ncomfortable with the concept and are able to identify and count eukaryotic species in most contexts.\nBiologists have also identified alternate measures of biodiversity, some of which are important for planning\n1372\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nhow to preserve biodiversity.\nGenetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts. Genetic diversity, or genetic variation defines the raw material for evolution\nand adaptation in a species. A species\u2019 future potential for adaptation depends on the genetic diversity held in the genomes of\nthe individuals in populations that make up the species. The same is true for higher taxonomic categories. A genus with very\ndifferent types of species will have more genetic diversity than a genus with species that are genetically similar and have similar\necologies. If there were a choice between one of these genera of species being preserved, the one with the greatest potential for\nsubsequent evolution is the most genetically diverse one.\nMany genes code for proteins, which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing.\nGenetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their cells,\nboth the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism. This chemical diversity has potential benefit for\nhumans as a source of pharmaceuticals, so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health and\nwelfare.\nHumans have generated diversity in domestic animals, plants, and fungi, among many other organisms. This diversity is also\nsuffering losses because of migration, market forces, and increasing globalism in agriculture, especially in densely populated\nregions such as China, India, and Japan. The human population directly depends on this diversity as a stable food source, and its\ndecline is troubling biologists and agricultural scientists.\nIt is also useful to define ecosystem diversity, meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or within a given\ngeographic area (Figure 47.2). Whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other\necosystems. The loss of an ecosystem means the loss of interactions between species, the loss of unique features of\ncoadaptation, and the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem is able to create. An example of a largely extinct\necosystem in North America is the prairie ecosystem. Prairies once spanned central North America from the boreal forest in\nnorthern Canada down into Mexico. They are now all but gone, replaced by crop fields, pasture lands, and suburban sprawl.\nMany of the species survive elsewhere, but the hugely productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating the most\nproductive agricultural soils in the United States is now gone. As a consequence, native soils are disappearing or must be\nmaintained and enhanced at great expense.\n47.1 \u2022 The Biodiversity Crisis\n1373\nFigure 47.2 The variety of ecosystems on Earth\u2014from (a) coral reef to (b) prairie\u2014enables a great diversity of species to exist. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Jim Maragos, USFWS; credit b: modification of work by Jim Minnerath, USFWS)\nCurrent Species Diversity\nDespite considerable effort, knowledge of the species that inhabit the planet is limited and always will be because of a\ncontinuing lack of financial resources and political willpower. A recent estimate suggests that the eukaryote species for which\nscience has names, about 1.5 million species, account for less than 20 percent of the total number of eukaryote species present\non the planet (8.7 million species, by one estimate). Estimates of numbers of prokaryotic species are largely guesses, but\nbiologists agree that science has only begun to catalog their diversity. Even with what is known, there is no central repository of\nnames or samples of the described species; therefore, there is no way to be sure that the 1.5 million descriptions is an accurate\naccounting. It is a best guess based on the opinions of experts in different taxonomic groups. Given that Earth is losing species\nat an accelerating pace, science is very much in the place it was with the Lake Victoria cichlids: knowing little about what is being\nlost. Table 47.1 presents recent estimates of biodiversity in different groups.\nEstimates of the Numbers of Described and Predicted Species by Taxonomic Group\nMora et al. 20111\nChapman 20092\nGroombridge & Jenkins 20023\nDescribed\nPredicted\nDescribed\nPredicted\nDescribed\nPredicted\nAnimalia\n1,124,516\n9,920,000\n1,424,153\n6,836,330\n1,225,500\n10,820,000\nTable 47.1\n1374\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nMora et al. 20111\nChapman 20092\nGroombridge & Jenkins 20023\nChromista\n17,892\n34,900\n25,044\n200,500\n\u2014\n\u2014\nFungi\n44,368\n616,320\n98,998\n1,500,000\n72,000\n1,500,000\nPlantae\n224,244\n314,600\n310,129\n390,800\n270,000\n320,000\nProtozoa\n16,236\n72,800\n28,871\n1,000,000\n80,000\n600,000\nProkaryotes\n\u2014\n\u2014\n10,307\n1,000,000\n10,175\n\u2014\nTotal\n1,438,769\n10,960,000\n1,897,502\n10,897,630\n1,657,675\n13,240,000\nTable 47.1\nThere are various initiatives to catalog described species in accessible ways, and the internet is facilitating that effort.\nNevertheless, it has been pointed out that at the current rate of new species descriptions (which according to the State of\nObserved Species Report is 17,000 to 20,000 new species per year), it will take close to 500 years to finish describing life on this\nplanet.4 Over time, the task becomes both increasingly difficult and increasingly easier as extinction removes species from the\nplanet.\nNaming and counting species may seem like an unimportant pursuit given the other needs of humanity, but determining\nbiodiversity it is not simply an accounting of species. Describing a species is a complex process through which biologists\ndetermine an organism\u2019s unique characteristics and whether or not that organism belongs to any other described species or\ngenus. It allows biologists to find and recognize the species after the initial discovery, and allows them to follow up on questions\nabout its biology. In addition, the unique characteristics of each species make it potentially valuable to humans or other species\non which humans depend.\nPatterns of Biodiversity\nBiodiversity is not evenly distributed on Earth. Lake Victoria contained almost 500 species of cichlids alone, ignoring the other\nfish families present in the lake. All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria; therefore, the 500 species of cichlids were\nendemic. Endemic species are found in only one location. Endemics with highly restricted distributions are particularly\nvulnerable to extinction. Higher taxonomic levels, such as genera and families, can also be endemic. Lake Michigan contains\nabout 79 species of fish, many of which are found in other lakes in North America. What accounts for the difference in fish\ndiversity in these two lakes? Lake Victoria is an ancient tropical lake, while Lake Michigan is a recently formed temperate lake.\nLake Michigan in its present form is only about 7,000 years old, while Lake Victoria in its present form is about 15,000 years old,\nalthough its basin is about 400,000 years in age. Biogeographers have suggested these two factors, latitude and age, are two of\nseveral hypotheses to explain biodiversity patterns on the planet.\n1Mora Camilo et al., \u201cHow Many Species Are There on Earth and in the Ocean?\u201d PLoS Biology (2011), doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127.\n2Arthur D.

The work of\nbiogeographers is critical to understanding our physical environment, how the environment affects species, and how\nenvironmental changes impact the distribution of a species; it has also been critical to developing modern evolutionary theory.\nBiogeographers need to understand both biology and ecology. They also need to be well-versed in evolutionary studies, soil\nscience, and climatology.\nThere are three main fields of study under the heading of biogeography: ecological biogeography, historical biogeography (called\npaleobiogeography), and conservation biogeography. Ecological biogeography studies the current factors affecting the\ndistribution of plants and animals. Historical biogeography, as the name implies, studies the past distribution of species.\nConservation biogeography, on the other hand, is focused on the protection and restoration of species based upon known\nhistorical and current ecological information. Each of these fields considers both zoogeography and phytogeography\u2014the past\nand present distribution of animals and plants.\nOne of the oldest observed patterns in ecology is that species biodiversity in almost every taxonomic group increases as latitude\ndeclines. In other words, biodiversity increases closer to the equator (Figure 47.3).\nFigure 47.3 This map illustrates the number of amphibian species across the globe and shows the trend toward higher biodiversity at lower\nlatitudes. A similar pattern is observed for most taxonomic groups. The white areas indicate a lack of data in this particular study.\nIt is not yet clear why biodiversity increases closer to the equator, but scientists have several hypotheses. One factor may be the\ngreater age of the ecosystems in the tropics versus those in temperate regions; the temperate regions were largely devoid of life\nor were drastically reduced during the last glaciation. The idea is that greater age provides more time for speciation. Another\npossible explanation is the increased direct energy the tropics receive from the sun versus the decreased intensity of the solar\nenergy that temperate and polar regions receive. Tropical ecosystem complexity may promote speciation by increasing the\nheterogeneity, or number of ecological niches, in the tropics relative to higher latitudes. The greater heterogeneity provides\nmore opportunities for coevolution, specialization, and perhaps greater selection pressures leading to population\ndifferentiation. However, this hypothesis suffers from some circularity\u2014ecosystems with more species encourage speciation,\nbut how did they get more species to begin with?\nThe tropics have been perceived as being more stable than temperate regions, which have a pronounced climate and day-length\nseasonality. The tropics have their own forms of seasonality, such as rainfall, but they are generally assumed to be more stable\nenvironments and this stability might promote speciation into highly specialized niches.\n1376\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nRegardless of the mechanisms, it is certainly true that all levels of biodiversity are greatest in the tropics. Additionally, the rate of\nendemism is highest, and there are more biodiversity \u201chotspots.\u201d However, this richness of diversity also means that knowledge\nof species is unfortunately very low, and there is a high potential for biodiversity loss.\nConservation of Biodiversity\nIn 1988, British environmentalist Norman Myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and at\nsignificant risk for species loss: biodiversity hotspots. Biodiversity hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers\nof endemic species. The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts, a kind\nof conservation triage. By protecting hotspots, governments are able to protect a larger number of species. The original criteria\nfor a hotspot included the presence of 1500 or more endemic plant species and 70 percent of the area disturbed by human\nactivity. There are now 34 biodiversity hotspots (Figure 47.4) containing large numbers of endemic species, which include half of\nEarth\u2019s endemic plants.\nFigure 47.4 Conservation International has identified 34 biodiversity hotspots, which cover only 2.3 percent of the Earth\u2019s surface but have\nendemic to them 42 percent of the terrestrial vertebrate species and 50 percent of the world\u2019s plants.\nBiodiversity Change through Geological Time\nThe number of species on the planet, or in any geographical area, is the result of an equilibrium of two evolutionary processes\nthat are continuously ongoing: speciation and extinction. Both are natural \u201cbirth\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d processes of macroevolution.\nWhen speciation rates begin to outstrip extinction rates, the number of species will increase; likewise, the number of species\nwill decrease when extinction rates begin to overtake speciation rates. Throughout Earth\u2019s history, these two processes have\nfluctuated\u2014sometimes leading to dramatic changes in the number of species on Earth as reflected in the fossil record (Figure\n47.5).\n47.1 \u2022 The Biodiversity Crisis\n1377\nFigure 47.5 Percent extinction occurrences as reflected in the fossil record have fluctuated throughout Earth\u2019s history. Sudden and\ndramatic losses of biodiversity, called mass extinctions, have occurred five times.\nPaleontologists have identified five strata in the fossil record that appear to show sudden and dramatic (greater than half of all\nextant species disappearing from the fossil record) losses in biodiversity. These are called mass extinctions. There are many\nlesser, yet still dramatic, extinction events, but the five mass extinctions have attracted the most research. An argument can be\nmade that the five mass extinctions are only the five most extreme events in a continuous series of large extinction events\nthroughout the Phanerozoic (since 542 million years ago). In most cases, the hypothesized causes are still controversial; however,\nthe most recent mass extinction event seems clear.\nThe Five Mass Extinctions\nThe fossil record of the mass extinctions was the basis for defining periods of geological history, so they typically occur at the\ntransition point between geological periods. The transition in fossils from one period to another reflects the dramatic loss of\nspecies and the gradual origin of new species. These transitions can be seen in the rock strata. Table 47.2 provides data on the\nfive mass extinctions.\nMass Extinctions\nGeological Period\nMass Extinction Name\nTime (millions of years ago)\nOrdovician\u2013Silurian\nend-Ordovician O\u2013S\n450\u2013440\nLate Devonian\nend-Devonian\n375\u2013360\nPermian\u2013Triassic\nend-Permian\n251\nTriassic\u2013Jurassic\nend-Triassic\n205\nCretaceous\u2013Paleogene\nend-Cretaceous K\u2013Pg (K\u2013T)\n65.5\nTable 47.2 This table shows the names and dates for the five mass extinctions in Earth\u2019s\nhistory.\nThe Ordovician-Silurian extinction event is the first recorded mass extinction and the second largest. During this period, about\n1378\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n85 percent of marine species (few species lived outside the oceans) became extinct. The main hypothesis for its cause is a period\nof glaciation and then warming. The extinction event actually consists of two extinction events separated by about 1 million\nyears. The first event was caused by cooling, and the second event was due to the subsequent warming. The climate changes\naffected temperatures and sea levels. Some researchers have suggested that a gamma-ray burst, caused by a nearby supernova,\nwas a possible cause of the Ordovician-Silurian extinction. The gamma-ray burst would have stripped away the Earth\u2019s\nprotective ozone layer, allowing intense ultraviolet radiation from the sun to reach the surface of the earth\u2014and may account for\nclimate changes observed at the time. The hypothesis is very speculative, and extraterrestrial influences on Earth\u2019s history are an\nactive line of research. Recovery of biodiversity after the mass extinction took from 5 to 20 million years, depending on the\nlocation.\nThe late Devonian extinction may have occurred over a relatively long period of time. It appears to have mostly affected marine\nspecies and not so much the plants or animals inhabiting terrestrial habitats. The causes of this extinction are poorly\nunderstood.\nThe end-Permian extinction was the largest in the history of life. Indeed, an argument could be made that Earth became nearly\ndevoid of life during this extinction event. Estimates are that 96 percent of all marine species and 70 percent of all terrestrial\nspecies were lost. It was at this time, for example, that the trilobites, a group that survived the Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction,\nbecame extinct. The causes for this mass extinction are not clear, but the leading suspect is extended and widespread volcanic\nactivity that led to a runaway global-warming event. The oceans became largely anoxic, suffocating marine life. Terrestrial\ntetrapod diversity took 30 million years to recover after the end-Permian extinction. The Permian extinction dramatically altered\nEarth\u2019s biodiversity makeup and the course of evolution.\nThe causes of the Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event are not clear, and researchers argue hypotheses including climate change,\nasteroid impact, and volcanic eruptions. The extinction event occurred just before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea,\nalthough recent scholarship suggests that the extinctions may have occurred more gradually throughout the Triassic.\nThe causes of the end-Cretaceous extinction event are the ones that are best understood. It was during this extinction event\nabout 65 million years ago that the majority of the dinosaurs, the dominant vertebrate group for millions of years, disappeared\nfrom the planet (with the exception of a theropod clade that gave rise to birds).\nThe cause of this extinction is now understood to be the result of a cataclysmic impact of a large meteorite, or asteroid, off the\ncoast of what is now the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. This hypothesis, proposed first in 1980, was a radical explanation based on a sharp\nspike in the levels of iridium (which enters our atmosphere from meteors at a fairly constant rate but is otherwise absent on\nEarth\u2019s surface) in the rock stratum that marks the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods (Figure 47.6). This\nboundary marked the disappearance of the dinosaurs in fossils as well as many other taxa. The researchers who discovered the\niridium spike interpreted it as a rapid influx of iridium from space to the atmosphere (in the form of a large asteroid) rather\nthan a slowing in the deposition of sediments during that period. It was a radical explanation, but the report of an appropriately\naged and sized impact crater in 1991 made the hypothesis more believable. Now an abundance of geological evidence supports\nthe theory. Recovery times for biodiversity after the end-Cretaceous extinction are shorter, in geological time, than for the end-\nPermian extinction, on the order of 10 million years.\nAnother possibility, perhaps coincidental with the impact of the Yucatan asteroid, was extensive volcanism that began forming\nabout 66 million years ago, about the same time as the Yucatan asteroid impact, at the end of the Cretaceous. The lava flows\ncovered over 50 percent of what is now India. The release of volcanic gases, particularly sulphur dioxide, during the formation of\nthe traps contributed to climate change, which may have induced the mass extinction.\n47.1 \u2022 The Biodiversity Crisis\n1379\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 47.6 In 1980, Luis and Walter Alvarez, Frank Asaro, and Helen Michels discovered, across the world, a spike in the concentration of\niridium within the sedimentary layer at the K\u2013Pg boundary.

It is well known that the North American, and to\nsome degree Eurasian, megafauna\u2014large vertebrate animals\u2014disappeared toward the end of the last glaciation period. The\nextinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time period of 10,000\u201312,000 years ago. In North America, the\nlosses were quite dramatic and included the woolly mammoths (with an extant population existing until about 4,000 years ago\nin isolation on Wrangel Island, Canada), mastodon, giant beavers, giant ground sloths, saber-toothed cats, and the North\nAmerican camel, just to name a few. In the early 1900s, scientists first suggested the possibility that over-hunting caused the\nrapid extinction of these large animals. Research into this hypothesis continues today.\nIn general, the timing of the Pleistocene extinctions correlated with the arrival of paleo-humans, perhaps as long as 40,000\nyears ago, and not with climate-change events, which is the main competing hypothesis for these extinctions. The extinctions\nbegan in Australia about 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, just after the arrival of humans in the area: a marsupial lion, a giant one-\nton wombat, and several giant kangaroo species disappeared. In North America, the extinctions of almost all of the large\nmammals occurred 10,000\u201312,000 years ago. All that are left are the smaller mammals such as bears, elk, moose, and cougars.\nFinally, on many remote oceanic islands, the extinctions of many species occurred coincidentally with human arrivals. Not all of\nthe islands had large animals, but when there were large animals, they were often forced into extinction. Madagascar was\ncolonized about 2,000 years ago and the large mammals that lived there became extinct. Eurasia and Africa do not show this\npattern, but they also did not experience a recent arrival of hunter-gatherer humans. Rather, humans arrived in Eurasia\nhundreds of thousands of years ago. This topic remains an area of active research and hypothesizing. It seems clear that even if\nclimate played a role, in most cases human hunting precipitated the extinctions.\n1380\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nRecent Extinctions\nThe sixth, or Holocene, mass extinction appears to have begun earlier than previously believed and is largely due to the\ndisruptive activities of modern Homo sapiens. Since the beginning of the Holocene period, there are numerous recent\nextinctions of individual species that are recorded in human writings. Most of these are coincident with the expansion of the\nEuropean colonies since the 1500s.\nOne of the earlier and popularly known examples is the dodo bird. The odd pigeon-like bird lived in the forests of Mauritius (an\nisland in the Indian Ocean) and became extinct around 1662. The dodo was hunted for its meat by sailors and was easy prey\nbecause it approached people without fear (the dodo had not evolved with humans). Pigs, rats, and dogs brought to the island by\nEuropean ships also killed dodo young and eggs.\nSteller's sea cow became extinct in 1768; it was related to the manatee and probably once lived along the northwest coast of North\nAmerica. Steller's sea cow was first discovered by Europeans in 1741 and was overhunted for meat and oil. The last sea cow was\nkilled in 1768. That amounts to just 27 years between the sea cow\u2019s first contact with Europeans and extinction of the species!\nSince 1900, a variety of species have gone extinct, including the following:\n\u2022\nIn 1914, the last living passenger pigeon died in a zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio. This species had once darkened the skies of North\nAmerica during its migrations, but it was overhunted and suffered from habitat loss that resulted from the clearing of\nforests for farmland.\n\u2022\nThe Carolina parakeet, once common in the eastern United States, died out in 1918. It suffered habitat loss and was hunted\nto prevent it from eating orchard fruit. (The parakeet ate orchard fruit because its native foods were destroyed to make way\nfor farmland.)\n\u2022\nThe Japanese sea lion, which inhabited a broad area around Japan and the coast of Korea, became extinct in the 1950s due to\nfishermen.\n\u2022\nThe Caribbean monk seal was distributed throughout the Caribbean Sea but was driven to extinction via hunting by 1952.\nThese are only a few of the recorded extinctions in the past 500 years. The International Union for Conservation of Nature\n(IUCN) keeps a list of extinct and endangered species called the Red List. The list is not complete, but it describes 380 extinct\nspecies of vertebrates after 1500 AD, 86 of which were driven extinct by overhunting or overfishing.\nEstimates of Present-Time Extinction Rates\nEstimates of extinction rates are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without observation. The\nextinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans, especially if it has been hunted or used in some other way. But\nthere are many organisms that are of less interest to humans (not necessarily of less value) and many that are undescribed.\nThe background extinction rate is estimated to be about one per million species per year (E/MSY). For example, assuming there\nare about ten million species in existence, the expectation is that ten species would become extinct each year (each year\nrepresents ten million species per year).\nOne contemporary extinction rate estimate uses the extinctions in the written record since the year 1500. For birds alone this\nmethod yields an estimate of 26 E/MSY. However, this value may be an underestimate for three reasons. First, many species\nwould not have been described until much later in the time period, so their loss would have gone unnoticed. Second, the\nnumber of recently extinct vertebrate species is increasing because extinct species now are being described from skeletal\nremains. And third, some species are probably already extinct even though conservationists are reluctant to name them as such.\nTaking these factors into account raises the estimated extinction rate closer to 100 E/MSY. The predicted rate by the end of the\ncentury is 1500 E/MSY.\nA second approach to estimating present-time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring forest-\narea loss and understanding species-area relationships. The species-area relationship is the rate at which new species are seen\nwhen the area surveyed is increased. Studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of the island\nincreases. This phenomenon has also been shown to hold true in other island-like habitats as well, such as the mountain-top\ntepuis of Venezuela, which are surrounded by tropical forest. Turning this relationship around, if the habitat area is reduced,\nthe number of species living there will also decline. Estimates of extinction rates based on habitat loss and species-area\nrelationships have suggested that with about 90 percent habitat loss an expected 50 percent of species would become extinct.\nSpecies-area estimates have led to species extinction rate calculations of about 1000 E/MSY and higher. In general, actual\nobservations do not show this amount of loss and suggestions have been made that there is a delay in extinction. Recent work\nhas also called into question the applicability of the species-area relationship when estimating the loss of species. This work\n47.1 \u2022 The Biodiversity Crisis\n1381\nargues that the species-area relationship leads to an overestimate of extinction rates. A better relationship to use may be the\nendemics-area relationship. Using this method would bring estimates down to around 500 E/MSY in the coming century. Note\nthat this value is still 500 times the background rate.\nFigure 47.7 Studies have shown that the number of species present increases with the size of the habitat.

When biodiversity loss is thought of as the extinction of\nthe passenger pigeon, the dodo bird, and even the woolly mammoth, the loss may appear to be an emotional one. But is the loss\npractically important for the welfare of the human species? From the perspective of evolution and ecology, the loss of a\nparticular individual species is unimportant (however, we should note that the loss of a keystone species can lead to ecological\ndisaster). Extinction is a normal part of macroevolution. But the accelerated extinction rate translates into the loss of tens of\nthousands of species within our lifetimes, and it is likely to have dramatic effects on human welfare through the collapse of\necosystems and in added costs to maintain food production, clean air and water, and human health.\nAgriculture began after early hunter-gatherer societies first settled in one place and heavily modified their immediate\nenvironment. This cultural transition has made it difficult for humans to recognize their dependence on undomesticated living\nthings on the planet. Biologists recognize the human species is embedded in ecosystems and is dependent on them, just as\nevery other species on the planet is dependent. Technology smooths out the extremes of existence, but ultimately the human\nspecies cannot exist without a supportive ecosystem.\nHuman Health\nArcheological evidence indicates that humans have been using plants for medicinal uses for thousands of years. A Chinese\ndocument from approximately 2800 BC is believed to be the the first written account of herbal remedies, and such references\noccur throughout the global historical record. Contemporary indigenous societies that live close to the land often retain broad\nknowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area. Most plants produce secondary plant compounds, which are\ntoxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them, but some of which also work as medication.\nModern pharmaceutical science also recognizes the importance of these plant compounds. Examples of significant medicines\n1382\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nderived from plant compounds include aspirin, codeine, digoxin, atropine, and vincristine (Figure 47.8). Many medicines were\nonce derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized. It is estimated that, at one time, 25 percent of modern drugs\ncontained at least one plant extract. That number has probably decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant ingredients are\nreplaced by synthetic versions. Antibiotics, which are responsible for extraordinary improvements in health and lifespans in\ndeveloped countries, are compounds largely derived from fungi and bacteria.\nFigure 47.8 Catharanthus roseus, the Madagascar periwinkle, has various medicinal properties. Among other uses, it is a source of\nvincristine, a drug used in the treatment of lymphomas. (credit: Forest and Kim Starr)\nIn recent years, animal venoms and poisons have excited intense research for their medicinal potential. By 2007, the FDA had\napproved five drugs based on animal toxins to treat diseases such as hypertension, chronic pain, and diabetes. Another five\ndrugs are undergoing clinical trials, and at least six drugs are being used in other countries. Other toxins under investigation\ncome from mammals, snakes, lizards, various amphibians, fish, snails, octopuses, and scorpions.\nAside from representing billions of dollars in profits, these medicines improve people\u2019s lives. Pharmaceutical companies are\nalways looking for new compounds synthesized by living organisms that can function as medicines. It is estimated that 1/3 of\npharmaceutical research and development is spent on natural compounds and that about 35 percent of new drugs brought to\nmarket between 1981 and 2002 were derived from natural compounds. The opportunities for new medications will be reduced in\ndirect proportion to the disappearance of species.\nAgricultural Diversity\nSince the beginning of human agriculture more than 10,000 years ago, human groups have been breeding and selecting crop\nvarieties. This crop diversity matched the cultural diversity of highly subdivided populations of humans. For example, potatoes\nwere domesticated beginning around 7,000 years ago in the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia. The potatoes grown in that region\nbelong to seven species and the number of varieties likely is in the thousands. Even the Inca capital of Machu Picchu had\nnumerous gardens growing varieties of potatoes. Each variety has been bred to thrive at particular elevations and soil and\nclimate conditions. The diversity is driven by the diverse demands of the topography, the limited movement of people, and the\ndemands created by crop rotation for different varieties that will do well in different fields.\nPotatoes are only one example of human-generated diversity. Every plant, animal, and fungus that has been cultivated by\nhumans has been bred from original wild ancestor species into diverse varieties arising from the demands for food value,\nadaptation to growing conditions, and resistance to pests.\nThe potato also demonstrates risks of low crop diversity. The tragic Irish potato famine occurred when the single variety grown\nin Ireland became susceptible to a potato blight, wiping out the entire crop. The loss of the potato crop led to mass famine and\nthe related deaths of over one million people, as well as mass emigration of nearly two million people.\nDisease resistance is a chief benefit of crop biodiversity, and lack of diversity in contemporary crop species carries similar risks.\nSeed companies, which are the source of most crop varieties in developed countries, must continually breed new varieties to\nkeep up with evolving pest organisms. These same seed companies, however, have participated in the decline of the number of\nvarieties available as they focus on selling fewer varieties in more areas of the world.\nThe ability to create new crop varieties relies on the diversity of varieties available and the accessibility of wild forms related to\n47.2 \u2022 The Importance of Biodiversity to Human Life\n1383\nthe crop plant. These wild forms are often the source of new gene variants that can be bred with existing varieties to create\nvarieties with new attributes. Loss of wild species related to a crop will mean the loss of potential in crop improvement.\nMaintaining the genetic diversity of wild species related to domesticated species ensures our continued food supply.\nSince the 1920s, government agriculture departments have maintained seed banks of crop varieties as a way of maintaining crop\ndiversity. This system has flaws because, over time, seed banks are lost through accidents, and there is no way to replace them.\nIn 2008, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (Figure 47.9) began storing seeds from around the world as a backup system to the\nregional seed banks. If a regional seed bank stores varieties in Svalbard, losses can be replaced from Svalbard. Conditions within\nthe vault are maintained at ideal temperature and humidity for seed survival, but the deep underground location of the vault in\nthe arctic means that failure of the vault\u2019s systems will not compromise the climatic conditions inside the vault.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 47.9 The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a storage facility for seeds of Earth\u2019s diverse crops. (credit: Mari Tefre, Svalbard Global Seed\nVault)\nThe Svalbard Global Seed Vault is located on Spitsbergen island in Norway, which has an arctic climate. Why might an arctic\nclimate be good for seed storage?\nCrop success is largely dependent on the quality of the soil. Although some agricultural soils are rendered sterile using\ncontroversial cultivation and chemical treatments, most contain a huge diversity of organisms that maintain nutrient\ncycles\u2014breaking down organic matter into nutrient compounds that crops need for growth. These organisms also maintain soil\ntexture that affects water and oxygen dynamics in the soil that are necessary for plant growth. If farmers had to maintain arable\nsoil using alternate means, the cost of food would be much higher than it is now. These kinds of processes are called ecosystem\nservices. They occur within ecosystems, such as soil ecosystems, as a result of the diverse metabolic activities of the organisms\nliving there, but they provide benefits to human food production, drinking water availability, and breathable air.\nPlant pollination is another key ecosystem service, provided by various species of bees, other insects, and birds. One estimate\nindicates that honey bee pollination provides the United States a $1.6 billion annual benefit.\nHoney bee populations in North America have been suffering large losses caused by a syndrome known as colony collapse\ndisorder, whose cause is unclear. (Evidence suggests the possible culprits may be the invasive varroa mite coupled with the\nNosema gut parasite and acute paralysis virus.) Loss of these species would render it very difficult, if not impossible, to grow\nany of the 150 United States crops requiring pollination, including grapes, oranges, lemons, peppers, most brassica (broccoli\nand cauliflower), and many berries, melons, and nuts.\nFinally, humans compete for their food with crop pests, most of which are insects. Pesticides control these competitors;\nhowever, pesticides are costly and lose their effectiveness over time as pest populations adapt and evolve. They also lead to\ncollateral damage by killing non-pest species and risking the health of consumers and agricultural workers. Ecologists believe\nthat the bulk of the work in removing pests is actually done by predators and parasites of those pests, but the impact has not\nbeen well studied. A review found that in 74 percent of studies that looked for an effect of landscape complexity on natural\n1384\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nenemies of pests, the greater the complexity, the greater the effect of pest-suppressing organisms. An experimental study found\nthat introducing multiple enemies of pea aphids (an important alfalfa pest) increased the yield of alfalfa significantly. This study\nshows the importance of landscape diversity via the question of whether a diversity of pests is more effective at control than one\nsingle pest; the results showed this to be the case. Loss of diversity in pest enemies will inevitably make it more difficult and\ncostly to grow food.\nWild Food Sources\nIn addition to growing crops and raising animals for food, humans obtain food resources from wild populations, primarily fish\npopulations. In fact, for approximately 1 billion people worldwide, aquatic resources provide the main source of animal protein.\nBut since 1990, global fish production has declined, sometimes dramatically. Unfortunately, and despite considerable effort, few\nfisheries on the planet are managed for sustainability.\nFishery extinctions rarely lead to complete extinction of the harvested species, but rather to a radical restructuring of the marine\necosystem in which a dominant species is so over-harvested that it becomes a minor player, ecologically. In addition to humans\nlosing the food source, these alterations affect many other species in ways that are difficult or impossible to predict. The collapse\nof fisheries has dramatic and long-lasting effects on local populations that work in the fishery. In addition, the loss of an\ninexpensive protein source to populations that cannot afford to replace it will increase the cost of living and limit societies in\nother ways. In general, the fish taken from fisheries have shifted to smaller species as larger species are fished to extinction. The\nultimate outcome could clearly be the loss of aquatic systems as food sources.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView a brief video (http://openstax.org/l/declining_fish) discussing declining fish stocks.\nPsychological and Moral Value\nFinally, it has been clearly shown that humans benefit psychologically from living in a biodiverse world. A chief proponent of this\nidea is Harvard entomologist E. O. Wilson. He argues that human evolutionary history has adapted us to live in a natural\nenvironment and that city environments generate psychological stressors that affect human health and well-being. There is\nconsiderable research into the psychological regenerative benefits of natural landscapes that suggests the hypothesis may hold\nsome truth. In addition, there is a moral argument that humans have a responsibility to inflict as little harm as possible on other\nspecies.\n47.3 Threats to Biodiversity\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nIdentify significant threats to biodiversity\n\u2022\nExplain the effects of habitat loss, the introduction of exotic species, and hunting on biodiversity\n\u2022\nIdentify the early and predicted effects of climate change on biodiversity\nThe core threat to biodiversity on the planet, and therefore a threat to human welfare, is the combination of human population\ngrowth and resource exploitation. The human population requires resources to survive and grow, and those resources are being\nremoved unsustainably from the environment. The three greatest proximate threats to biodiversity are habitat loss,\noverharvesting, and the introduction of exotic species. The first two of these are a direct result of human population growth and\nresource use. The third results from increased mobility and trade. A fourth major cause of extinction, anthropogenic climate\nchange, has not yet had a large impact, but it is predicted to become significant during this century. Global climate change is\nalso a consequence of human population needs for energy and the use of fossil fuels to meet those needs (Figure 47.10).\nEnvironmental issues, such as toxic pollution, have specific targeted effects on species, but they are not generally seen as threats\nat the magnitude of the others.\n47.3 \u2022 Threats to Biodiversity\n1385\nFigure 47.10 Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels fluctuate in a cyclical manner. However, the burning of fossil fuels in recent history has\ncaused a dramatic increase in the levels of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which have now reached levels never before seen in\nhuman history. Scientists predict that the addition of this \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d to the atmosphere is resulting in climate change that will\nsignificantly impact biodiversity in the coming century.\nHabitat Loss\nHumans rely on technology to modify their environment and replace certain functions that were once performed by the natural\necosystem. Other species cannot do this. Elimination of their ecosystem\u2014whether it is a forest, a desert, a grassland, a\nfreshwater estuarine, or a marine environment\u2014will kill the individuals belonging to the species. The species will become\nextinct if we remove the entire habitat within the range of a species. Human destruction of habitats accelerated in the latter half\nof the twentieth century. Consider the exceptional biodiversity of Sumatra: it is home to one species of orangutan, a species of\ncritically endangered elephant, and the Sumatran tiger, but half of Sumatra\u2019s forest is now gone. The neighboring island of\nBorneo, home to the other species of orangutan, has lost a similar area of forest. Forest loss continues in protected areas of\nBorneo. All three species of orangutan are now listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature\n(IUCN), but they are simply the most visible of thousands of species that will not survive the disappearance of the forests in\nSumatra and Borneo. The forests are removed for timber and to plant palm oil plantations (Figure 47.11). Palm oil is used in\nmany products including food products, cosmetics, and biodiesel in Europe. A five-year estimate of global forest cover loss for\nthe years 2000\u20132005 was 3.1 percent. In the humid tropics where forest loss is primarily from timber extraction, 272,000 km2\nwas lost out of a global total of 11,564,000 km2 (or 2.4 percent). In the tropics, these losses certainly also represent the extinction\nof species because of high levels of endemism\u2014species unique to a defined geographic location, and found nowhere else.\n1386\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 47.11 (a) One of three species of orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, is found only in the rainforests of Borneo, and an other species of\norangutan (Pongo abelii) is found only in the rainforests of Sumatra. These animals are examples of the exceptional biodiversity of (c) the\nislands of Sumatra and Borneo. Other species include the (b) Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) and the (d) Sumatran elephant\n(Elephas maximus sumatranus), both critically endangered species.

Yet the market for illegally harvested tropical timber is huge, and the wood products often find\nthemselves in building supply stores in the United States. One estimate is that 10 percent of the imported timber stream in\nthe United States, which is the world\u2019s largest consumer of wood products, is potentially illegally logged. In 2006, this\namounted to $3.6 billion in wood products. Most of the illegal products are imported from countries that act as\n47.3 \u2022 Threats to Biodiversity\n1387\nHabitat destruction can affect ecosystems other than forests. Rivers and streams are important ecosystems that are frequently\nmodified through land development, damming, channelizing, or water removal. Damming affects the water flow to all parts of\na river, which can reduce or eliminate populations that had adapted to the natural flow of the river. For example, an estimated 91\npercent of United States rivers have been altered in some way. Modifications include dams, to create energy or store water;\nlevees, to prevent flooding; and dredging or rerouting, to create land that is more suitable for human development. Many fish\nand amphibian species and numerous freshwater clams in the United States have seen declines caused by river damming and\nhabitat loss.\nOverharvesting\nOverharvesting is a serious threat to many species, but particularly to aquatic (both marine and freshwater) species. Despite\nregulation and monitoring, there are recent examples of fishery collapse. The western Atlantic cod fishery is the among the most\nsignificant. While it was a hugely productive fishery for 400 years, the introduction of modern factory trawlers in the 1980s\ncaused it to become unsustainable. Fisheries collapse as a result of both economic and political factors. Fisheries are managed as\na shared international resource even when the fishing territory lies within an individual country\u2019s territorial waters. Common\nresources are subject to an economic pressure known as the tragedy of the commons, in which essentially no fisher has a\nmotivation to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when it is not owned by that fisher. Overexploitation is a common\noutcome. This overexploitation is exacerbated when access to the fishery is open and unregulated and when technology gives\nfishers the ability to overfish. In a few fisheries, the biological growth of the resource is less than the potential growth of the\nprofits made from fishing if that time and money were invested elsewhere. In these cases\u2014whales are an example\u2014economic\nforces will always drive toward fishing the population to extinction.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nExplore a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service interactive map (http://openstax.org/l/habitat_map) of critical habitat for endangered and\nthreatened species in the United States.

At the same time, fishery extinction is still harmful to fish species and their ecosystems. There are some instances in\nwhich true extinction is a possibility. Whales have slow-growing populations due to low reproductive rates, and therefore are at\nrisk of complete extinction through hunting. There are some species of sharks with restricted distributions that are at risk of\nextinction. The groupers are another population of generally slow-growing fishes that, in the Caribbean, includes a number of\nspecies that are at risk of extinction from overfishing.\nCoral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems that face immediate peril from several processes. Reefs are home to 1/3 of\nthe world\u2019s marine fish species\u2014about 4,000 species\u2014despite making up only 1 percent of marine habitat. Most home marine\naquaria are stocked with wild-caught organisms, not cultured organisms. Although no species is known to have been driven\nextinct by the pet trade in marine species, there are studies showing that populations of some species have declined in response\nto harvesting, indicating that the harvest is not sustainable at those levels. There are concerns about the effect of the pet trade on\nsome terrestrial species such as turtles, amphibians, birds, plants, and even the orangutan.\nintermediaries and are not the originators of the wood.\nHow is it possible to determine if a wood product, such as flooring, was harvested sustainably or even legally? The Forest\nStewardship Council (FSC) certifies sustainably harvested forest products, therefore, looking for their certification on\nflooring and other hardwood products is one way to ensure that the wood has not been taken illegally from a tropical forest.\nCertification applies to specific products, not to a producer; some producers\u2019 products may not have certification while\nother products are certified. While there are other industry-backed certifications other than the FSC, these are unreliable\ndue to lack of independence from the industry. Another approach is to buy domestic wood species. While it would be great\nif there was a list of legal versus illegal wood products, it is not that simple. Logging and forest management laws vary from\ncountry to country; what is illegal in one country may be legal in another. Where and how a product is harvested and\nwhether the forest from which it comes is being maintained sustainably all factor into whether a wood product will be\ncertified by the FSC. If you are in doubt, it is always a good idea to ask questions about where a wood product came from\nand how the supplier knows that it was harvested legally.\n1388\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView a brief video (http://openstax.org/l/ocean_matters) discussing the role of marine ecosystems in supporting human welfare\nand the decline of ocean ecosystems.\nBush meat is the generic term used for wild animals killed for food. Hunting is practiced throughout the world, but hunting\npractices, particularly in equatorial Africa and parts of Asia, are believed to threaten a number of species with extinction.\nTraditionally, bush meat in Africa was hunted to feed families directly; however, recent commercialization of the practice now\nhas bush meat available in grocery stores, which has increased harvest rates to the level of unsustainability. Additionally, human\npopulation growth has increased the need for protein foods that are not being met from agriculture. Species threatened by the\nbush meat trade are mostly mammals including many primates living in the Congo basin.\nExotic Species\nExotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced into an ecosystem in which they did not\nevolve. For example, Kudzu (Pueraria lobata), which is native to Japan, was introduced in the United States in 1876. It was later\nplanted for soil conservation. Problematically, it grows too well in the southeastern United States\u2014up to a foot a day. It is now\nan invasive pest species and covers over 7 million acres in the southeastern United States. If an introduced species is able to\nsurvive in its new habitat, that introduction is now reflected in the observed range of the species. Human transportation of\npeople and goods, including the intentional transport of organisms for trade, has dramatically increased the introduction of\nspecies into new ecosystems, sometimes at distances that are well beyond the capacity of the species to ever travel itself and\noutside the range of the species\u2019 natural predators.\nMost exotic species introductions probably fail because of the low number of individuals introduced or poor adaptation to the\necosystem they enter. Some species, however, possess pre-adaptations that can make them especially successful in a new\necosystem. These exotic species often undergo dramatic population increases in their new habitat and reset the ecological\nconditions in the new environment, threatening the species that exist there. For this reason, exotic species are also called\ninvasive species. Exotic species can threaten other species through competition for resources, predation, or disease. For\nexample, the Eurasian star thistle, also called spotted knapweed, has invaded and rendered useless some of the open prairies of\nthe western states. However, it is a great nectar-bearing flower for the production of honey and supports numerous pollinating\ninsects, including migrating monarch butterflies in the north-central states such as Michigan.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nExplore an interactive global database (http://openstax.org/l/exotic_invasive) of exotic or invasive species.\nLakes and islands are particularly vulnerable to extinction threats from introduced species. In Lake Victoria, as mentioned\nearlier, the intentional introduction of the Nile perch was largely responsible for the extinction of about 200 species of endemic\ncichlids. The accidental introduction of the brown tree snake via aircraft (Figure 47.12) from the Solomon Islands to Guam in\n1950 has led to the extinction of three species of birds and three to five species of reptiles endemic to the island. Several other\nspecies are still threatened. The brown tree snake is adept at exploiting human transportation as a means to migrate; one was\neven found on an aircraft arriving in Corpus Christi, Texas. Constant vigilance on the part of airport, military, and commercial\naircraft personnel is required to prevent the snake from moving from Guam to other islands in the Pacific, especially Hawaii.\nIslands do not make up a large area of land on the globe, but they do contain a disproportionate number of endemic species\nbecause of their isolation from mainland ancestors.\n47.3 \u2022 Threats to Biodiversity\n1389\nFigure 47.12 The brown tree snake, Boiga irregularis, is an exotic species that has caused numerous extinctions on the island of Guam\nsince its accidental introduction in 1950. (credit: NPS)\nIt now appears that the global decline in amphibian species recognized in the 1990s is, in some part, caused by the fungus\nBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the disease chytridiomycosis (Figure 47.13). There is evidence that the fungus is\nnative to Africa and may have been spread throughout the world by transport of a commonly used laboratory and pet species:\nthe African clawed toad (Xenopus laevis). It may well be that biologists themselves are responsible for spreading this disease\nworldwide. The North American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, which has also been widely introduced as a food animal but which\neasily escapes captivity, survives most infections of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, and can act as a reservoir for the disease.\nIt also is a voracious predator in freshwater lakes.\nFigure 47.13 This Limosa Harlequin Frog (Atelopus limosus), an endangered species from Panama, died from a fungal disease called\nchytridiomycosis. The red lesions are symptomatic of the disease. (credit: Brian Gratwicke)\nEarly evidence suggests that another fungal pathogen, Geomyces destructans, introduced from Europe is responsible for white-\nnose syndrome, which infects cave-hibernating bats in eastern North America and has spread from a point of origin in western\nNew York State (Figure 47.14). The disease has decimated bat populations and threatens extinction of species already listed as\nendangered: the Indiana bat, Myotis sodalis, and potentially the Virginia big-eared bat, Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus.\nHow the fungus was introduced is unclear, but one logical presumption would be that recreational cavers unintentionally\nbrought the fungus on clothes or equipment from Europe.\n1390\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nFigure 47.14 This little brown bat in Greeley Mine, Vermont, March 26, 2009, was found to have white-nose syndrome. (credit: Marvin\nMoriarty, USFWS)\nClimate Change\nClimate change, and specifically the anthropogenic (meaning, caused by humans) warming trend presently escalating, is\nrecognized as a major extinction threat, particularly when combined with other threats such as habitat loss and the expansion\nof disease organisms. Scientists disagree about the likely magnitude of the effects, with extinction rate estimates ranging from\n15 percent to 40 percent of species destined for extinction by 2050. Scientists do agree, however, that climate change will alter\nregional climates, including rainfall and snowfall patterns, making habitats less hospitable to the species living in them, in\nparticular, the endemic species. The warming trend will shift colder climates toward the north and south poles, forcing species\nto move with their adapted climate norms while facing habitat gaps along the way. The shifting ranges will impose new\ncompetitive regimes on species as they find themselves in contact with other species not present in their historic range. One\nsuch unexpected species contact is between polar bears and grizzly bears. Previously, these two distinct species had separate\nranges. Now, their ranges are overlapping and there are documented cases of these two species mating and producing viable\noffspring, which may or may not be viable crossing back to either parental species. Changing climates also throw off species\u2019\ndelicate timed adaptations to seasonal food resources and breeding times. Many contemporary mismatches to shifts in resource\navailability and timing have already been documented.\n47.3 \u2022 Threats to Biodiversity\n1391\nFigure 47.15 Since 2008, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) have been spotted farther north than their historic range, a possible\nconsequence of climate change. As a result, grizzly bear habitat now overlaps polar bear (Ursus maritimus) habitat. The two species of\nbears, which are capable of mating and producing viable offspring, are considered separate \u201cecological\u201d species because historically they\nlived in different habitats and never met. However, in 2006 a hunter shot a wild grizzly-polar bear hybrid known as a grolar bear, the first\nwild hybrid ever found.\nRange shifts are already being observed: for example, some European bird species ranges have moved 91 km northward. The\nsame study suggested that the optimal shift based on warming trends was double that distance, suggesting that the populations\nare not moving quickly enough. Range shifts have also been observed in plants, butterflies, other insects, freshwater fishes,\nreptiles, and mammals.\nClimate gradients will also move up mountains, eventually crowding species higher in altitude and eliminating the habitat for\nthose species adapted to the highest elevations. Some climates will completely disappear. The accelerating rate of warming in\nthe arctic significantly reduces snowfall and the formation of sea ice. Without the ice, species like polar bears cannot\nsuccessfully hunt seals, which are their only reliable source of food. Sea ice coverage has been decreasing since observations\nbegan in the mid-twentieth century, and the rate of decline observed in recent years is far greater than previously predicted.\nFinally, global warming will raise ocean levels due to meltwater from glaciers and the greater volume of warmer water.\nShorelines will be inundated, reducing island size, which will have an effect on some species, and a number of islands will\ndisappear entirely. Additionally, the gradual melting and subsequent refreezing of the poles, glaciers, and higher elevation\nmountains\u2014a cycle that has provided freshwater to environments for centuries\u2014will also be jeopardized. This could result in an\noverabundance of salt water and a shortage of fresh water.\n1392\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n47.4 Preserving Biodiversity\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nIdentify new technologies and methods for describing biodiversity\n\u2022\nExplain the legislative framework for conservation\n\u2022\nDescribe principles and challenges of conservation preserve design\n\u2022\nIdentify examples of the effects of habitat restoration\n\u2022\nDiscuss the role of zoos in biodiversity conservation\nPreserving biodiversity is an extraordinary challenge that must be met by greater understanding of biodiversity itself, changes\nin human behavior and beliefs, and various preservation strategies.\nMeasuring Biodiversity\nThe technology of molecular genetics and data processing and storage are maturing to the point where cataloguing the planet\u2019s\nspecies in an accessible way is now feasible. DNA barcoding is one molecular genetic method, which takes advantage of rapid\nevolution in a mitochondrial gene (cytochrome c oxidase 1) present in eukaryotes, except for plants, to identify species using the\nsequence of portions of the gene. However, plants may be barcoded using a combination of chloroplast genes. Rapid mass\nsequencing machines make the molecular genetics portion of the work relatively inexpensive and quick. Computer resources\nstore and make available the large volumes of data. Projects are currently underway to use DNA barcoding to catalog museum\nspecimens, which have already been named and studied, as well as testing the method on less-studied groups. As of mid 2017,\nclose to 200,000 named species had been barcoded. Early studies suggest there are significant numbers of undescribed species\nthat looked too much like sibling species to previously be recognized as different. These now can be identified with DNA\nbarcoding.\nNumerous computer databases now provide information about named species and a framework for adding new species.\nHowever, as already noted, at the present rate of description of new species, it will take close to 500 years before the complete\ncatalog of life is known. Many, perhaps most, species on the planet do not have that much time.\nThere is also the problem of understanding which species known to science are threatened and to what degree they are\nthreatened. This task is carried out by the non-profit IUCN which, as previously mentioned, maintains the Red List\u2014an online\nlisting of endangered species categorized by taxonomy, type of threat, and other criteria (Figure 47.16). The Red List is supported\nby scientific research. In 2011, the list contained 61,000 species, all with supporting documentation.\nVISUAL CONNECTION\nFigure 47.16 This chart shows the percentage of various animal species, by group, on the IUCN Red List as of 2007.\nWhich of the following statements is not supported by this graph?\n47.4 \u2022 Preserving Biodiversity\n1393\na.\nThere are more vulnerable fishes than critically endangered and endangered fishes combined.\nb.\nThere are more critically endangered amphibians than vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered reptiles\ncombined.\nc.\nWithin each group, there are more critically endangered species than vulnerable species.\nd.\nA greater percentage of bird species are critically endangered than mollusk species.\nChanging Human Behavior\nLegislation throughout the world has been enacted to protect species. The legislation includes international treaties as well as\nnational and state laws. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) treaty\ncame into force in 1975. The treaty, and the national legislation that supports it, provides a legal framework for preventing\napproximately 33,000 listed species from being transported across nations\u2019 borders, thus protecting them from being caught or\nkilled when international trade is involved. The treaty is limited in its reach because it only deals with international movement of\norganisms or their parts. It is also limited by various countries\u2019 ability or willingness to enforce the treaty and supporting\nlegislation. The illegal trade in organisms and their parts is probably a market in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Illegal\nwildlife trade is monitored by another non-profit: Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce (TRAFFIC).\nWithin many countries there are laws that protect endangered species and regulate hunting and fishing. In the United States,\nthe Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted in 1973. Species at risk are listed by the Act; the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service is\nrequired by law to develop plans that protect the listed species and bring them back to sustainable numbers. The Act, and others\nlike it in other countries, is a useful tool, but it suffers because it is often difficult to get a species listed, or to get an effective\nmanagement plan in place once it is listed. Additionally, species may be controversially taken off the list without necessarily\nhaving had a change in their situation. More fundamentally, the approach to protecting individual species rather than entire\necosystems is both inefficient and focuses efforts on a few highly visible and often charismatic species, perhaps at the expense of\nother species that go unprotected. At the same time, the Act has a critical habitat provision outlined in the recovery mechanism\nthat may benefit species other than the one targeted for management.\nThe Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) is an agreement between the United States and Canada that was signed into law in 1918 in\nresponse to declines in North American bird species caused by hunting. The Act now lists over 800 protected species. It makes it\nillegal to disturb or kill the protected species or distribute their parts (much of the hunting of birds in the past was for their\nfeathers).\nAs already mentioned, the private non-profit sector plays a large role in the conservation effort both in North America and\naround the world. The approaches range from species-specific organizations to the broadly focused IUCN and TRAFFIC. The\nNature Conservancy takes a novel approach. It purchases land and protects it in an attempt to set up preserves for ecosystems.\nAlthough it is focused largely on reducing carbon and related emissions, the Paris Climate Agreement is a significant step\ntoward altering human behavior in a way that should affect biodiversity. If the agreement is successful in its goal of halting\nglobal temperature rise, many species negatively affected by climate change may benefit. Assessments of the accord\u2019s\nimplementation will not take place until 2023, and measurement of its effects will not be feasible for some time. However, the\nagreement, signed by over 194 countries, represents the world\u2019s most concerted and unified effort to reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions, embrace alternative energy sources, and ease climate pressure on ecosystems.\nConservation in Preserves\nEstablishment of wildlife and ecosystem preserves is one of the key tools in conservation efforts. A preserve is an area of land set\naside with varying degrees of protection for the organisms that exist within the boundaries of the preserve. Preserves can be\neffective in the short term for protecting both species and ecosystems, but they face challenges that scientists are still exploring\nto strengthen their viability as long-term solutions to the preservation of biodiversity and the prevention of extinction.\nHow Much Area to Preserve?\nDue to the way protected lands are allocated and the way biodiversity is distributed, it is challenging to determine how much\nland or marine habitat should be protected. The IUCN World Parks Congress estimated that 11.5 percent of Earth\u2019s land surface\nwas covered by preserves of various kinds in 2003. We should note that this area is greater than previous goals; however, it only\nincludes 9 out of 14 recognized major biomes. Similarly, individual animals or types of animals are not equally represented on\npreserves. For example, high quality preserves include only about 50 percent of threatened amphibian species. To guarantee that\n1394\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nall threatened species will be properly protected, either the protected areas must increase in size, or the percentage of high\nquality preserves must increase, or preserves must be targeted with greater attention to biodiversity protection. Researchers\nindicate that more attention to the latter solution is required.\nPreserve Design\nThere has been extensive research into optimal preserve designs for maintaining biodiversity. The fundamental principle behind\nmuch of the research has been the seminal theoretical work of Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson published in 1967 on\nisland biogeography.5 This work sought to understand the factors affecting biodiversity on islands. The fundamental conclusion\nwas that biodiversity on an island was a function of the origin of species through migration, speciation, and extinction on that\nisland. Islands farther from a mainland are harder to get to, so migration is lower and the equilibrium number of species is\nlower. Within island populations, evidence suggests that the number of species gradually increases to a level similar to the\nnumbers on the mainland from which the species is suspected to have migrated. In addition, smaller islands are harder to find,\nso their immigration rates for new species are typically lower. Smaller islands are also less geographically diverse so all things\nbeing equal, there are fewer niches to promote speciation. And finally, smaller islands support smaller populations, so the\nprobability of extinction is higher.\nAs islands get larger, the number of species able to colonize the island and find suitable niches on the island increases, although\nthe effect of island area on species numbers is not a direct correlation. Conservation preserves can be seen as \u201cislands\u201d of habitat\nwithin \u201can ocean\u201d of non-habitat. For a species to persist in a preserve, the preserve must be large enough to support it. The\ncritical size depends, in part, on the home range that is characteristic of the species. A preserve for wolves, which range\nhundreds of kilometers, must be much larger than a preserve for butterflies, which might range within ten kilometers during its\nlifetime. But larger preserves have more core area of optimal habitat for individual species, they have more niches to support\nmore species, and they attract more species because they can be found and reached more easily.\nPreserves perform better when there are buffer zones around them of suboptimal habitat. The buffer allows organisms to exit\nthe boundaries of the preserve without immediate negative consequences from predation or lack of resources. One large\npreserve is better than the same area of several smaller preserves because there is more core habitat unaffected by edges. For\nthis same reason, preserves in the shape of a square or circle will be better than a preserve with many thin \u201carms.\u201d If preserves\nmust be smaller, then providing wildlife corridors between them so that individuals (and their genes) can move between the\npreserves, for example along rivers and streams, will make the smaller preserves behave more like a large one. All of these\nfactors are taken into consideration when planning the nature of a preserve before the land is set aside.\nIn addition to the physical, biological, and ecological specifications of a preserve, there are a variety of policy, legislative, and\nenforcement specifications related to uses of the preserve for functions other than protection of species. These can include\nanything from timber extraction, mineral extraction, regulated hunting, human habitation, and nondestructive human\nrecreation. Many of these policy decisions are made based on political pressures rather than conservation considerations. In\nsome cases, wildlife protection policies have been so strict that subsistence-living indigenous populations have been forced from\nancestral lands that fell within a preserve. In other cases, even if a preserve is designed to protect wildlife, if the protections are\nnot or cannot be enforced, the preserve status will have little meaning in the face of illegal poaching and timber extraction. This\nis a widespread problem with preserves in areas of the tropics.\nLimitations on Preserves\nSome of the limitations on preserves as conservation tools are evident from the discussion of preserve design. Political and\neconomic pressures typically make preserves smaller, rather than larger, so setting aside areas that are large enough is difficult.\nIf the area set aside is sufficiently large, there may not be sufficient area to create a buffer around the preserve. In this case, an\narea on the outer edges of the preserve inevitably becomes a riskier suboptimal habitat for the species in the preserve.\nEnforcement of protections is also a significant issue in countries without the resources or political will to prevent poaching and\nillegal resource extraction.\nClimate change will create inevitable problems with the location of preserves. The species within them may migrate to higher\nlatitudes as the habitat of the preserve becomes less favorable. Scientists are planning for the effects of global warming on future\npreserves and striving to predict the need for new preserves to accommodate anticipated changes to habitats; however, the end\neffectiveness is tenuous since these efforts are prediction based.\n5Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson, E. O., The Theory of Island Biogeography (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1967).\n47.4 \u2022 Preserving Biodiversity\n1395\nFinally, an argument can be made that conservation preserves indicate that humans are growing more separate from nature,\nand that humans only operate in ways that do damage to biodiversity. Creating preserves may reduce the pressure on humans\noutside the preserve to be sustainable and non-damaging to biodiversity. On the other hand, properly managed, high quality\npreserves present opportunities for humans to witness nature in a less damaging way, and preserves may present some financial\nbenefits to local economies. Ultimately, the economic and demographic pressures on biodiversity are unlikely to be mitigated by\npreserves alone. In order to fully benefit from biodiversity, humans will need to alter activities that damage it.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nAn interactive global data system (http://openstax.org/l/protected_areas) of protected areas can be found at this website. Review\ndata about individual protected areas by location or study statistics on protected areas by country or region.\nHabitat Restoration\nHabitat restoration holds considerable promise as a mechanism for restoring and maintaining biodiversity. Of course, once a\nspecies has become extinct, its restoration is impossible. However, restoration can improve the biodiversity of degraded\necosystems. Reintroducing wolves, a top predator, to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 led to dramatic changes in the ecosystem\nthat increased biodiversity. The wolves (Figure 47.17) function to suppress elk and coyote populations and provide more\nabundant resources to the guild of carrion eaters. Reducing elk populations has allowed revegetation of riparian areas, which\nhas increased the diversity of species in that habitat. Decreasing the coyote population has increased the populations of species\nthat were previously suppressed by this predator. The number of species of carrion eaters has increased because of the predatory\nactivities of the wolves. In this habitat, the wolf is a keystone species, meaning a species that is instrumental in maintaining\ndiversity in an ecosystem. Removing a keystone species from an ecological community may cause a collapse in diversity. The\nresults from the Yellowstone experiment suggest that restoring a keystone species can have the effect of restoring biodiversity in\nthe community. Ecologists have argued for the identification of keystone species where possible and for focusing protection\nefforts on those species; likewise, it also makes sense to attempt to return them to their ecosystem if they have been removed.\nFigure 47.17 (a) The Gibbon wolf pack in Yellowstone National Park, March 1, 2007, represents a keystone species. The reintroduction of\nwolves into Yellowstone National Park in 1995 led to a change in the grazing behavior of (b) elk. To avoid predation, the elk no longer grazed\nexposed stream and riverbeds, such as (c) the Lamar Riverbed in Yellowstone. This allowed willow and cottonwood seedlings to grow and\nrecolonized large areas. The seedlings decreased erosion and provided shading to the creek, which improved fish habitat. A new colony of\n(d) beaver may also have benefited from the habitat change. (credit a: modification of work by Doug Smith, NPS; credit c: modification of\nwork by Jim Peaco, NPS; credit d: modification of work by \u201cShiny Things\u201d/Flickr)\nOther large-scale restoration experiments underway involve dam removal, which is a national movement that is accelerating in\nimportance. In the United States, since the mid-1980s, many aging dams are being considered for removal rather than\n1396\nChapter 47 \u2022 Conservation Biology and Biodiversity\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\nreplacement because of shifting beliefs about the ecological value of free-flowing rivers and because many dams no longer\nprovide the benefit and functions that they did when they were first built. The measured benefits of dam removal include\nrestoration of naturally fluctuating water levels (the purpose of dams is frequently to reduce variation in river flows), which\nleads to increased fish diversity and improved water quality. In the Pacific Northwest, dam removal projects are expected to\nincrease populations of salmon, which is considered a keystone species because it transports key nutrients to inland ecosystems\nduring its annual spawning migrations. In other regions such as the Atlantic coast, dam removal has allowed the return of\nspawning anadromous fish species (species that are born in fresh water, live most of their lives in salt water, and return to fresh\nwater to spawn). Some of the largest dam removal projects have yet to occur or have happened too recently for the consequences\nto be measured. The large-scale ecological experiments that these removal projects constitute will provide valuable data for\nother dam projects slated either for removal or construction.\nThe Role of Captive Breeding\nZoos have sought to play a role in conservation efforts both through captive breeding programs and education. The\ntransformation of the missions of zoos from collection and exhibition facilities to organizations that are dedicated to\nconservation is ongoing and gaining strength. In general, it has been recognized that, except in some specific targeted cases,\ncaptive breeding programs for endangered species are inefficient and often prone to failure when the species are reintroduced\nto the wild. However, captive breeding programs have yielded some success stories, such as the American condor reintroduction\nto the Grand Canyon and the reestablishment of the Whooping Crane along the Midwest flyway.\nUnfortunately, zoo facilities are far too limited to contemplate captive breeding programs for the numbers of species that are\nnow at risk. Education is another potential positive impact of zoos on conservation efforts, particularly given the global trend to\nurbanization and the consequent reduction in contacts between people and wildlife. A number of studies have been performed\nto look at the effectiveness of zoos on people\u2019s attitudes and actions regarding conservation; at present, the results tend to be\nmixed.\n47.4 \u2022 Preserving Biodiversity\n1397\n", "key_terms": "\nadaptive radiation\nrapid branching through speciation of a\nphylogenetic tree into many closely related species\nbiodiversity\nvariety of a biological system, typically\nconceived as the number of species, but also applying to\ngenes, biochemistry, and ecosystems\nbiodiversity hotspot\nconcept originated by Norman Myers\nto describe a geographical region with a large number of\nendemic species and a large percentage of degraded\nhabitat\nbush meat\nwild-caught animal used as food (typically\nmammals, birds, and reptiles); usually referring to\nhunting in the tropics of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and\nthe Americas\nchemical diversity\nvariety of metabolic compounds in an\necosystem\nchytridiomycosis\ndisease of amphibians caused by the\nfungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; thought to be a\nmajor cause of the global amphibian decline\nDNA barcoding\nmolecular genetic method for identifying a\nunique genetic sequence to associate with a species\necosystem diversity\nvariety of ecosystems\nendemic species\nspecies native to one place\nexotic species\n(also, invasive species) species that has been\nintroduced to an ecosystem in which it did not evolve\nextinction\ndisappearance of a species from Earth; local\nextinction is the disappearance of a species from a region\nextinction rate\nnumber of species becoming extinct over\ntime, sometimes defined as extinctions per million\nspecies\u2013years to make numbers manageable (E/MSY)\ngenetic diversity\nvariety of genes in a species or other\ntaxonomic group or ecosystem, the term can refer to\nallelic diversity or genome-wide diversity\nheterogeneity\nnumber of ecological niches\nmegafauna\nlarge animals\nsecondary plant compound\ncompound produced as\nbyproducts of plant metabolic processes that is usually\ntoxic, but is sequestered by the plant to defend against\nherbivores\nspecies-area relationship\nrelationship between area\nsurveyed and number of species encountered; typically\nmeasured by incrementally increasing the area of a\nsurvey and determining the cumulative numbers of\nspecies\ntragedy of the commons\neconomic principle that resources\nheld in common will inevitably be overexploited\nwhite-nose syndrome\ndisease of cave-hibernating bats in\nthe eastern United States and Canada associated with the\nfungus Geomyces destructans\n", "chapter_summary": " SUMMARY\n47.1 The Biodiversity Crisis\nBiodiversity exists at multiple levels of organization and is\nmeasured in different ways depending on the scientific goals\nof those taking the measurements. These measurements\ninclude numbers of species, genetic diversity, chemical\ndiversity, and ecosystem diversity. The number of described\nspecies is estimated to be 1.5 million with about 17,000 new\nspecies being described each year. Estimates for the total\nnumber of species on Earth vary but are on the order of 10\nmillion. Biodiversity is negatively correlated with latitude for\nmost taxa, meaning that biodiversity is higher in the tropics.\nThe mechanism for this pattern is not known with certainty,\nbut several plausible hypotheses have been advanced.\nFive mass extinctions with losses of more than 50 percent of\nextant species are observable in the fossil record.\nBiodiversity recovery times after mass extinctions vary, but\nmay be as long as 30 million years. Recent extinctions are\nrecorded in written history and are the basis for one method\nof estimating contemporary extinction rates. The other\nmethod uses measures of habitat loss and species-area\nrelationships. Estimates of contemporary extinction rates\nvary, but some rates are as high as 500 times the background\nrate, as determined from the fossil record, and are predicted\nto rise.\n47.2 The Importance of Biodiversity\nto Human Life\nHumans use many compounds that were first discovered or\nderived from living organisms as medicines: secondary plant\ncompounds, animal toxins, and antibiotics produced by\nbacteria and fungi. More medicines will undoubtedly be\ndiscovered in nature. Loss of biodiversity will impact the\nnumber of pharmaceuticals available to humans.\nCrop diversity is a requirement for food security, and it is\nbeing lost. The loss of wild relatives to crops also threatens\nbreeders\u2019 abilities to create new varieties. Ecosystems\nprovide ecosystem services that support human agriculture:\npollination, nutrient cycling, pest control, and soil\ndevelopment and maintenance. Loss of biodiversity\nthreatens these ecosystem services and risks making food\nproduction more expensive or impossible. Wild food sources\nare mainly aquatic, but few of these resources are being\nmanaged for sustainability. Fisheries\u2019 ability to provide\nprotein to human populations is threatened when extinction\noccurs.\nBiodiversity may provide important psychological benefits to\nhumans. Additionally, there are moral arguments for the\nmaintenance of biodiversity.\n1398\nChapter 47 \u2022 Key Terms\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n47.3 Threats to Biodiversity\nThe core threats to biodiversity are human population\ngrowth and unsustainable resource use. To date, the most\nsignificant causes of extinctions are habitat loss,\nintroduction of exotic species, and overharvesting. Climate\nchange is predicted to be a significant cause of extinctions in\nthe coming century. Habitat loss occurs through\ndeforestation, damming of rivers, and other disruptive\nhuman activities. Overharvesting is a threat particularly to\naquatic species, while the taking of bush meat in the humid\ntropics threatens many species in Asia, Africa, and the\nAmericas. Exotic species have been the cause of a number of\nextinctions and are especially damaging to islands and lakes.\nExotic species\u2019 introductions are increasing damaging native\necosystems around the world because of the increased\nmobility of human populations and growing global trade and\ntransportation. Climate change is forcing range changes that\nmay lead to extinction. It is also affecting adaptations to the\ntiming of resource availability that negatively affects species\nin seasonal environments. The impacts of climate change are\ngreatest in the arctic. Global warming will also raise sea\nlevels, eliminating some islands and reducing the area of all\nothers.\n47.4 Preserving Biodiversity\nNew technological methods such as DNA barcoding and\ninformation processing and accessibility are facilitating the\ncataloging of the planet\u2019s biodiversity. There is also a\nlegislative framework for biodiversity protection.\nInternational treaties such as CITES regulate the\ntransportation of endangered species across international\nborders. Legislation within individual countries protecting\nspecies and agreements on global warming have had limited\nsuccess; the Paris Climate accord is currently being\nimplemented as a means to reduce global climate change.\nIn the United States, the Endangered Species Act protects\nlisted species but is hampered by procedural difficulties and\na focus on individual species. The Migratory Bird Act is an\nagreement between Canada and the United States to protect\nmigratory birds. The non-profit sector is also very active in\nconservation efforts in a variety of ways.\nConservation preserves are a major tool in biodiversity\nprotection. Presently, 11 percent of Earth\u2019s land surface is\nprotected in some way. The science of island biogeography\nhas informed the optimal design of preserves; however,\npreserves have limitations imposed by political and\neconomic forces. In addition, climate change will limit the\neffectiveness of preserves in the future. A downside of\npreserves is that they may lessen the pressure on human\nsocieties to function more sustainably outside the preserves.\nHabitat restoration has the potential to restore ecosystems to\nprevious biodiversity levels before species become extinct.\nExamples of restoration include reintroduction of keystone\nspecies and removal of dams on rivers. Zoos have attempted\nto take a more active role in conservation and can have a\nlimited role in captive breeding programs. Zoos also have a\nuseful role in education.\n", "visual_connection_questions": "\n1.
